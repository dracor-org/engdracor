        <head>TO Sir ROBERT MARSHAM, Knight and Barronet. </head>
        <p>WHat shall I say, or how excuse my Boldness, in venturing to make so mean a present, and without permission too; I am full of fears, tho hitherto I have still run the same risque, and always found my Friends so good both to forgive and accept my worthless trifles: Nay even her Royal Highness shew'd such a benign Condescention, as not only to pardon my ambitious daring, but also Incouraged my Pen, why then shou'd I fright my self with the apprehension of your Frowns and Anger, when at the same time I know you to be the most Generous and best tempered Man in the World. </p>
        <p>I look upon those that endeavour'd to discountenance this Play as Enemys to me, not that, and had the Play been never so good they wou'd have shew'd their Teeth: Yet sure, if you be so Noble to protect it, their good manners (that is, if they understand any) tho their spite remains will make 'em cease to Cavil at the Work, when such a worthy name Adorns the Frontispiece. I must not trouble you with the little Malice of my Foe, nor is his Name fit to be mentioned in a Paper addrest to Sir <hi>Robert Marsham</hi>, he has Printed so great a falshood, it deserves no Answer; yet give me leave without being thought Impertinent or Prolix, to say I now am pleased and treated by those who please every Spectator with a Candour and Sweetness not to be exprest. </p>
        <p>If I followd my inclinations, I shou'd now proceed to recite <pb xml:id="ep000672-003-a"/>those Vertues which all the happy World that have the Honour to know you daily see, but that I am sure woud be the way to offend, for you scarce hate Vice more than to hear of your Merits, therefore I shall only add, as you are Happy in your Lady, Happy in your Children, which are Lovely and Hopeful as an Indulgent Parents wish can form; Happy in Fortune, Capacious like your Soul; Happy in your Friends, who love you even to Fondness: That Heaven may continue all these Blessings many succeeding Years, is the earnest and daily wish of, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE, spoken by Mr. Bowen. </head>
        <l>DEceiv'd Deceiver, and Impostor 〈◊〉! </l>
        <l>An Audience and the 〈…〉! </l>
        <l>All trick and cheat! Pshaw, 'tis the Devil and all, </l>
        <l>I'll warr'nt ye we shall now have Cups and Ball; </l>
        <l>No, Gallants, we those tricks don't understand; </l>
        <l>'Tis t'other House best shows the slight of hand: </l>
        <l>Hey Iingo, Sirs, what's this! their Come●y? </l>
        <l>Presto be gone, 'tis now our Farce you see. </l>
        <l>By neat conveyance you have seen and know it </l>
        <l>They can transform an Actor to a Poet. </l>
        <l>With empty Dishes tho●'ll set out a Treat, </l>
        <l>Whole Seas of Broth, but a small Isle of Meat: </l>
        <l>With Powderle-Pimp of Dance, Machine and Song, </l>
        <l>They'll spin●ye out short Nonsense four hours long: </l>
        <l>With Fountains, Groves, Bombast and airy Fancies </l>
        <l>Larded with Cynthias, little Loves and Dances: </l>
        <l>Which put together, makes it hard to say, </l>
        <l>If Poet, Painter, or Fidler made the Play. </l>
        <l>But hold, my business lies another way. </l>
        <l>Not to bespeak your praise by kind perswasions, </l>
        <l>But to desire the favour of your patience. </l>
        <l>Our Case is thus: </l>
        <l>Our Authoress, like true Women, shew'd her Play </l>
        <l>To some, who, like true Wits, stole't half away. </l>
        <l>We've Fee'd no Councel yet, tho some advise us </l>
        <l>T' indite the Plagiaries at Apollo's Sizes? </l>
        <l>But ah, how they'd out face a Damsel civil: </l>
        <l>Who've impudence enough to out face the Devil: </l>
        <l>Besides, shou'd they be cast by prosecution, </l>
        <l>'Tis now too late to think of restitution; </l>
        <l>And faith, I hear, that some do shrewdly opine </l>
        <l>They Trade with other Muses than the nine. </l>
        <l>I name no names, but you may easily guess, </l>
        <l>They that can cheat the Devil can cheat the Flesh. </l>
        <l>Therefore to you kind Sirs, as to the Laws </l>
        <l>Of Iustice she submits her self and Cause, </l>
        <l>For to whom else shou'd a wrong'd Poet sue. </l>
        <l>There's no appeal to any Court but you. </l>

        <l>A begging Epilogue's a despairing Case; </l>
        <l>'Tis asking mercy when the doom is past. </l>

        <head type="sub">Design'd for Mr. Verbruggen. </head>
        <l>NOw Britain's raging Wars are at an end, </l>
        <l>Caesar adorns the Throne he did defend; </l>
        <l>Eternal Peace is fix'd, and all things smile, </l>
        <l>To Crown the happy blessings of our Isle: </l>
        <l>From hence, we have encouragement to expect, </l>
        <l>The Stage with nobler off'rings shall be deck'd; </l>
        <l>For in past Ages Peace did Wit create, </l>
        <l>And Poets flourish'd equal to the state. </l>
        <l>'Twas when the great Augustus rul'd in Peace </l>
        <l>And all mankind from him enjoyn'd sweet ease: </l>
        <l>Ovid's soft genius first began to please. </l>
        <l>'Twas then the Lyrick Horace, Son of Fame, </l>
        <l>Compil'd his works, immortal as his Name, </l>
        <l>Soft ●ase and quiet fancy did infuse, </l>
        <l>And Rome's blest state gave Birth to Virgil's Muse. </l>
        <l>Oh, may our state like that produce such Men, </l>
        <l>That from the crop of their luxuriant Pen, </l>
        <l>Succeeding Ages may for ever glean. </l>
        <l>Criticks their nature then shall alter quite </l>
        <l>And what they fain would damn shall praise in spite. </l>
        <l>Poets no more in humble lines shall sue </l>
        <l>And creep and cringe to steal applause from you, </l>
        <l>Nor beg for Favour where no Favour's due: </l>
        <l>No more shall sense in fustian lines be lost, </l>
        <l>Nor dullness flourish at the Actor's cost. </l>
        <l>Authors shall write with fancy unconfin'd </l>
        <l>To Copy Nature and reform Mankind, </l>
        <l>Then Wit and sense shall here for ever dwell, </l>
        <l>And Britain's Stage shall Athen's far excel </l>
