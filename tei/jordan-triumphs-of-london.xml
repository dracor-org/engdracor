          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IN all flourishing Kingdoms throughout the Universe (especially Islands) honest Merchants and useful Merchandize have been ever had in a reverential Esteem. Their Profession in all former Ages highly magnified, and their Persons honourably valued: In that by their Cost, Adventures, Diligence, and Vigilance, <hi>incognite Countries </hi>have been discovered, <hi>Royal Amity </hi>introduced and confirmed with Transmarine Estates and Princes: As also (by reason of their generous Examples, and prevalent Perswasions) very brutish Nations, with barbarous Natures, have been reduced to Meekness, Order, and Civility. By Merchants, all Exotick Commodities from every Part of the World are made communicable in Traffick with us, whose numerous Varieties, pleasant Rarities, and substantial Necessaries, serve both for Delight and Profit to the Crown and Kingdom. They increase Shipping, multiply Navigators, and employ all Handicrafts. Many of them have not only been the Erectors of stately Structures, but the Founders of great and famous Cities. What may be said of Merchants and their Trafficks, their Antiquity, Dignity, Magnanimity, Generosity and Urbanity, is fitter to fill a Volume, than to be contracted in the narrow Bondage of a compendious Epistle. </p>
        <p>Therefore since Your Lordship hath so ample an Interest in this precedent Character, it is an especial Act of <hi>Almighty Providence</hi>, to indulge and dignifie this Honourable City with such an Accomplished Magistrate, whose Examples and Precepts are both prudent and pious, and may justly provoke all Persons under Your Government to be regular and obedient; which although but for One Year, yet is the Epitome of a Life-time: Thorow which, that you may have the daily Manuduction of that Great Governour of Heaven and Earth (the only Ruler of Princes) shall be the <hi>assidual Wishes </hi>and <hi>devout Desires </hi>of, <hi>My Lord</hi>, </p>
