        <lg>
          <l>NOw Fancy's up; lest waiting palls the jest; </l>
          <l>Psyche the second's coming half undrest: </l>
          <l>But in that Garb you like fine Women best. </l>
          <l>Let our Rich Neighbours mock our Farce; we know </l>
          <l>(Already, th'utmost) of their Puppet-show. </l>
          <l>Since they'gainst Nature go, they Heav'n offend, </l>
          <l>If Natures purpose then cross Natures end; </l>
          <l>Unnat'ral Nature is not Natures Friend. </l>
          <l>[— There's Nature for you. </l>
          <l>As Aesop's Cat dressed in a Nymph's disguise, </l>
          <l>Their gaudy Trifle may at first surprize; </l>
          <l>None but the <hi>(Dirty-rout</hi>) will like it twice: </l>
          <l>A well drest Frollick once may please the eye; </l>
          <l>But Plays (like Women,) can't so satisfie. </l>
          <l>Ye masked Nymphs can tell, there's somthing in ye, </l>
          <l>Besides a painted face that gets the penny: </l>
          <l>Yet all the Fame you give'em, we'l allow </l>
          <l>To their best Plays, and their best Actors too. </l>
          <l>That is, the Painter, Carpenter, and show </l>
          <l>Beaumont, and Fletcher, Poet, and Devow. </l>
          <l>But Sirs, free harmless Mirth you here condemn, </l>
          <l>And Clap at down-right Baudery in them. </l>
          <l>In Epsom-Wells, for example— </l>
          <l>Are they not still for pushing Nature on, </l>
          <l>Till Natures feat thus in your sight is done. </l>
          <l>Oh Lord!— </l>
          <l>Take off their Psyches borrow'd plumes awhile, </l>
          <l>Hopkins and Sternhold rise, and claim your style; </l>
          <l>Dread Kings of Brentford! leave Lardellas Herse, </l>
          <l>Psyches despairing Lovers steal your verse: </l>
          <l>And let Apollo's Priest restore again </l>
          <l>What from the nobler Mamamouchy's ta'n. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <pb xml:id="ep000540-003-a"/>
          <l>Let'em restore your Treble prices too, </l>
          <l>To see how strangely still they bubble you, </l>
          <l>It makes me blush; and that I seldom do. </l>
          <l>Now Psyche's strip'd from all her gay attire, </l>
          <l>TE DE POLYKAGATHOY, Behold the Fire! </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But Oh! a long Farewell to all this sort, </l>
          <l>Which Musick Scenes, nor Preface can support. </l>
          <l>Yet you admire it, make'em thankful for't: </l>
          <l>Alass their Charge was great, and you must pay't. </l>
          <l>If they should purchase at a cursed Rate, </l>
          <l>The New-come Elephant, and shew't in State; </l>
          <l>Get him a Room with Pomp and Lux'ry drest, </l>
          <l>Would you pay Crowns a piece to see the Beast? </l>
          <l>Show some of your good Natures here kind Sirs; </l>
          <l>If our Conceit less proud or gay appears, </l>
          <l>She's less expensive, and more brisk then theirs. </l>

            <p>Be it so; I'le give directions to the Jury in a wise speech according to Custom, and then we'l adjourn the Court. </p>
            <p>Gentlemen of the Jury, it was an Ancient saying among the noble Romans, and worthy of everlasting Fame; set the Hares Head against the Goose-Jiblets, and 'tis a right worthy custom among those modern Heroes: that Collar-Beef <pb n="71" xml:id="ep000540-041-b"/>to put a layer of fat, and a layer of lean, and what is all this for, but to teach us to mix Mercy with Justice?— We are here met together, and for what are we met togeher? to lye (like Diogenes lazily) in a Tub, 'till the Sun cures the disease of State; No, we must set our hand to the Plough tail, let every one pluck a hair from the thick bushy Beard of Malefactors, and the Chinn of mischief will soon be bald; as <hi>Poor Robbin </hi>has it in his modern Philosophy: We have discover'd a Wasps Nest of Hornets to you, 'tis your part to set the Brimstone of Justice on fire, and smother them with the smoak of Correction.— Two are found Guilty, of stealing most Feloniously Gammer Redstreaks head from her shoulders, so much to her Detriment, that she will hardly ever be her own Woman again.— This appears as clear to the eye of reason, as if it were written with the Rain-bow on the South wind. </p>
            <p>The two eldest Daughters of King Andrew, of notorious memory are in for stealing Trenchers.— You must find them Guilty, because We the mouth of the Law determine it; If any grumblings of Conscience arise within yow. The Court over-rules them; Psyche the 2d. also Miss Nonsy shall be freed, because her Predecessor Psyche the first was, though both (for runing from their Fathers; and practising publickly what their Sisters did but wish well to) deserve more punishment then they.— Now dispatch! and as Socrates says what you do, do quickly?— I read your Sentence in your looks; The Princes have already suffer'd, and for your Ladies errant. The Sentence of the Court is, that you never be marri'd, but allow'd the Conversation of all men through a Grate without touching any; to Lasses of your Complexion, I think this is as bad as drawing Water in a Cieve, or being hang'd in Chains alive; away with them. </p>
