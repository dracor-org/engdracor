        <head>To the Most Illustrious Prince WILLIAM, Duke of NEWCASTLE, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>May it please your Grace, </opener>
        <p>SO long as your Grace pèrsists in Obliging, I must go on in Acknowledging; nor can I let any opportunity pass of telling the World how much I am favored by you; or any occasion slip of assuring your Grace, that all the actions of my life shall be dedicated to your service; who by your Noble Patronage, your Generosity and Kindness, and your continual Bounty, have made me wholly your Creature: nor can I forbear to declare, that I am more obliged to your Grace, than to all Mankind. And my misfortune is, I can make no other return, but a declaration of my grateful Resentments. </p>
        <p>When I shew'd your Grace some part of this Comedy, at Welbeck, being all that I had then written of it, you were pleased to express your great liking of it, which was a sufficient encouragment for me to proceed in it: And when I had finish'd it, to lay it humbly at your feet; what ever I write, I will submit to your Grace, who are the greatest Master of Wit, the most exact Observer of Mankind, and the most accurate Judge of Humour, that ever I knew. And were I not assured of the Greatness of your favour, I should be afraid of the excellency of your judgment. </p>
        <p>I have endeavoured in this Play at Humor, Wit, and Satyr, which are the three things (however I may have fallen short in my attempt) which your Grace has often told me, are the life of a Comedy. Four of the Humors are entirely new; and (without vanity) I may say. I ne'r produc'd a Comedy that had not some natural Humour in it not represented before, nor I hope ever shall. Nor do I count those Humours which a great many do, that is to say, such as consist in using one or two By-words; or in having a fantastick, extravagant Dress, as many pretended Humours have; nor in the affectation of some French words, which several Plays 〈◊〉 shown us. I say nothing of impossible, unnatural Farce Fools, which some intend for Comical who think it the easiest thing in the world to write a Comedy, and yet will sooner grow rich upon their ill Plays 〈◊〉 write a good one: Nor is downright silly folly a Humour, as some take it to be for 'tis a 〈◊〉 natural Imperfection; and they might as 〈◊〉 call it a humour of Blindness in a blind man, or Lameness in a lame one: Or as a celebrated French 〈◊〉 has the humour of one <pb xml:id="ep000739-004-a"/>who speaks very fast, and of another who speaks very slow: But Natural imperfections are not fit Subjects for Comedy, since they are not to be laugh'd at, but pitied. But the Artificial folly of those, who are not Coxcombs by Nature, but with great Art and Industry make themselves so, is a proper object of Comedy, as I have discoursed at large in the Preface to the Humorists, written five years since: Those slight circumstantial things mentioned before are not enough to make a good Comical Humour: which ought to be such an affectation, as misguides men in Knowledge, Art, or Science, or that causes defection in Manners, and Morality, or perverts their minds in the main Actions of their lives. And this kind of Humour I think I have not improperly described in the Epilogue to the Humorist. </p>
        <p>But your Grace understands Humour too well not to know this, and much more than I can say of it. All I have now to do, is, humbly to Dedicate this Play to your Grace, which has succeeded beyond my expectation, and the Humours of which have been approved by Men of the best Sense and Learning. Nor do I hear of any profest Enemies to the Play, but some Women and some Men of Feminine understandings, who like slight Plays onely, that represent a little tattle sort of Conversation like their own; but true Humour is not liked or understood by them, and therefore even my attempt towards it is condemned by them. But the same people, to my great comfort, damn all Mr. Johnson's Plays, who was 〈◊〉 the best Drammatick Poet that ever was, or, I believe, ever will be; and I had rather be Author of one Scene in his best Comedies, than of any Play this Age has produced. That there are a great many faults in the conduct of this Play, I am not ignorant. But I (having no Pension but from the Theatre, which is either unwilling, or unable, to reward a Man sufficiently, for so much pains as correct Comedies require) cannot allot my whole time to the writing of Plays, but am forced to mind some other business of Advantage. (Had I as much Money, and as much time for it) I might perhaps write as Correct a Comedy as any of my Contemporaries. But I hope your Grace will accept of this with all its imperfections; which since the Royal Family have received favorably, I have all my aim, if it be approved by your Grace, who are next to them, in the greatest esteem and observance of, </p>

        <lg>
          <l>YOu come with such an eager appetite </l>
          <l>To a late Play, which gave so great delight; </l>
          <l>Our Poet fears, that by so rich a Treat, </l>
          <l>Your Palates are become too delicate. </l>
          <l>Yet since y'have had Rhime for a relishing Bit, </l>
          <l>To give a better taste to Comick Wit. </l>
          <l>But this requires expence of time and pains, </l>
          <l>Too great, alas, for Poets slender gains. </l>
          <l>For Wit, like China, should long buri'd lie, </l>
          <l>Before it ripens to good Comedy; </l>
          <l>A thing we ne'r have seen since Johnson's days, </l>
          <l>And but a few of his were perfect Plays. </l>
          <l>Now Drudges of the Stage must oft appear, </l>
          <l>They must be bound to scribble twice a year. </l>
          <l>Thus the thin thred-bare Vicar still must toil, </l>
          <l>While the fat lazie Doctor bears the spoil. </l>
          <l>In the last Comedy some Wits were shown; </l>
          <l>In this are Fools that much infest the Town. </l>
          <l>Plenty of Fops, grievances of the Age, </l>
          <l>Whose nauseous Figures ne'r were on a Stage. </l>
          <l>He cannot say they'll please you, but they're new; </l>
          <l>And he hopes you will say, he has drawn▪ em true. </l>
          <l>He's sure in Wit he cann't excel the rest, </l>
          <l>He'd but be thought to write a Fool the best. </l>
          <l>Such Fools as haunt and trouble Men of Wit, </l>
          <l>And spight of them will for their Pictures sit. </l>
          <l>Yet no one Coxcomb in this Play is shown; </l>
          <l>No one Man's humour makes a part alone, </l>
          <l>But scatter'd follies gather'd into one. </l>
          <l>He says, if with new Fops he can but please; </l>
          <l>He'll twice a year produce as new as these. </l>

          <l>Who to your dear dull selves are kind alone, </l>
          <l>And ne'r reflect on follies of your own: </l>
          <l>Our Poet can from you no mercy find, </l>
          <l>Who savage are to all but your own kind. </l>
          <l>Nay, on the Stage if some of those appear, </l>
          <l>Though ne'r so like your selves, you hate 'em there, </l>
          <l>As the whole Herd falls on a wounded Deer. </l>
          <l>But of those Ladies he despairs to day, </l>
          <l>Who love a dull Romantick whining Play; </l>
          <l>Where poor frail Woman's made a Deity, </l>
          <l>With sens●…ss amorous Idolatry, </l>
          <l>And snivelling Heroes sigh, and pine, and cry. </l>
          <l>Though singly they beat Armies, and Hu●…s Kings, </l>
          <l>Rant at the Gods, and do impossible things; </l>
          <l>Though they can laugh at danger, bloud and wounds; </l>
          <l>Yet if the Dame once chides, the milk-sop Hero swoons. </l>
          <l>These doughty things, nor Manners have, nor Wit; </l>
          <l>We ne'r saw Hero fit to drink with yet. </l>
          <l>But hold, I hear some say among the rest, </l>
          <l>This Play is not well bred, nor yet well drest; </l>
          <l>Such Plays the Womens Poets can write best: </l>
          <l>They difser from the Mens, you must allow, </l>
          <l>As Womens Taylors Womens Poets too. </l>
          <l>But know, good breeding shows its excellence, </l>
          <l>Not in small trifling forms, but in good sense. </l>
          <l>Yet, Ladies, to Stage-fools some favour show, </l>
          <l>Since off the Stage some Fops you can allow. </l>
          <l>Few of the Sexes happy Favourites yet </l>
          <l>Have been the most remarkable for Wit: </l>
          <l>Sure you must like Copies of such as these, </l>
          <l>If the Original Coxcombs can so please. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000739-050-a"/>
          <l>But to the Men of Wit our Poet flies, </l>
          <l>And makes his Fops to them a Sacrifice: </l>
          <l>You know the pangs, and many labouring throws, </l>
          <l>By which your Brains their perfect births disclose. </l>
          <l>You can the faults and excellencies find; </l>
          <l>Pass by the one, and be to th'other kind. </l>
          <l>By you he is resolv'd to stand or fall: </l>
          <l>What e'r's his doom he'll not repine at all. </l>
          <l>And if this Birth shou'd want its perfect shape, </l>
          <l>And cannot by your care its death escape, </l>
          <l>Th'abortive Issue came before its day, </l>
