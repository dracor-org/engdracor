        <stage xml:id="ep000483-e150">A Play Bill discover'd upon the Door, Enter like a Country Gentleman. </stage>
        <l>WHat's here? <hi>never Acted before</hi>, Hey-day! </l>
        <l>This certainly is some insipid Play. </l>
        <l>
          <hi>Wits lead by the Nose</hi>, I Gad I'de best retire, </l>
        <l>They'le find me out to be some Country Squire; </l>
        <l>And then for certain though I'm not a Wit, </l>
        <l>They'le thrust me 'mongst my Brethren in the Pit; </l>
        <l>Where with Debauches, Noise, and little Miss, </l>
        <l>I shall be Martyr'd worse then Poet is, </l>
        <l>And be oblig'd for Company to hiss. </l>
        <l>To shun the Danger of th' admiring Crew </l>
        <l>B'w'y Miss, Boy, House, and Brethren all Adew. </l>
        <stage xml:id="ep000483-e290">Offers to go, but returns. </stage>
        <l>Gad should I stay, they'd cheat me with pretence </l>
        <l>Of a new Play call'd <hi>Country Innocence</hi>, </l>
        <l>Or what was worst of all, the Devil take her, </l>
        <l>A Debauch'd Chambermaid forsooth <hi>turn'd Quaker</hi>. </l>
        <l>These little Tricks, so often put on Wits, </l>
        <l>Made me forswear to come in either Pits. </l>
        <l>
          <hi>Midnights Intreagues</hi>, and <hi>Conjerer de France</hi>, </l>
        <l>Insipid fribling and unruly dance </l>
        <l>So turnd my stomach— </l>
        <l>I talk, as if concern'd at what they doe, </l>
        <l>I Gad Dear Brethren 'tis for none but you. </l>
        <l>It grieves my heart to see you yawn i'th' Pit, </l>
        <l>As if you came for sleep, and not for Wit. </l>
        <l>Another Crew, with good diverting Play, </l>
        <l>Passes the tedious hours of Show away, </l>
        <l>Pumping for wit to manage him next day. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000483-003-a"/>
        <l>Gad what with that, ill nature, and worse, W— </l>
        <l>The Actors are quite Acted out of Doors. </l>
        <l>Disease, Impotence, and endless Rage, </l>
        <l>Have been the ruin of this noble Stage. </l>
        <l>I shun'd the danger, Gad with much adoe, </l>
        <l>To be a Country Wit like some of you. </l>
        <l>The Civil Wars betwixt the Blew, and Red, </l>
        <l>Was but a spice of Pride stoln from the head: </l>
        <l>In Imitation of such growing men, </l>
        <l>They've got the Knack to be undone again: </l>
        <l>Ruin's Triumphant, and in Masquerade </l>
        <l>Appears in ev'ry Corner to invade </l>
        <l>The easie natur'd fools, and spoile the trade. </l>
        <l>And will you hear how 'tis? The house is grown </l>
        <l>So out of date to th' ruling Fops o'th' Town, </l>
        <l>That in a Month, I Gad, you scarcely come </l>
        <l>T' applaud, but to debauch i'th' tyring Room; </l>
        <l>Where having whisper'd your Harmonious Miss, </l>
        <l>You creep into the Pit, and frame a Hiss. </l>
        <l>You think new Plays, such as can please the Age, </l>
        <l>Are not the work of this, but t'other Stage: </l>
        <l>Let us provide even the best we can, </l>
        <l>Here they'le scarce please a Country Gentleman; </l>
        <l>Much less those Huffing Wits, who sans remorse, </l>
        <l>Make down right rayling here their common course, </l>
        <l>And Jockie-like, damm the best running Horse. </l>
        <l>In former Ages you came here for Wit, </l>
        <l>Glean'd what best pleas'd, and then forsook the Pit: </l>
        <l>You think us Barren, and to others steare, </l>
        <l>And gape for Wit, but find no more then here. </l>
        <l>S'death, not to Plays but Puppet shows you run, </l>
        <l>Sure you're in Love with dear Mrs. such a one, </l>
        <l>And court her shadow ere the Play's begun. </l>
        <l>When you're come here, as Gad 'tis very rare, </l>
        <l>You serve us like the Monsters of the Faire; </l>
        <l>Hiss without reason, damm without controule, </l>
        <l>As if you meant to Sacrifice the Soul. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000483-003-b"/>
        <l>This strange unkindness has our Stage undone, </l>
        <l>And all that you thought Actors faith are gone: </l>
        <l>The men to Misses, Places, or Estates, </l>
        <l>The Women to their kind and welcome Fates; </l>
        <l>Thus both at once retiring from the Stage, </l>
        <l>Have left us here the Objects of your Rage. </l>
        <l>To court your kindness were alass but vain, </l>
        <l>You must be Damming though you Damm in pain. </l>
        <l>'Mongst the hard hearted, I good natures spy, </l>
        <l>And kindness dancing in each Ladies eye; </l>
        <l>They to commiserate, not hate, were born, </l>
        <l>I know you are too kind and fair to scorn; </l>
        <l>Your blushing Cheeks good Nature doth betray, </l>
        <l>It lies on you to save, or Damm the Play; </l>
        <l>Our unlearn'd Author to your doom submits, </l>
        <l>Desirous to be try'd by Female Wits: </l>
        <l>If you applaud him all his pains are crown'd, </l>
        <l>And he'l defie the huffing Criticks round. </l>

        <l>By Instigation, or by Precept led, </l>

        <l>He writ, and hop'd to please as well as they, </l>
        <l>But he mistook, and Jaded his poor Muse, </l>
        <l>And what he though Jocose, prov'd mere abuse. </l>
        <l>The Drudging Scribler quakes within, for fear </l>
        <l>You should turn Hectors and dissect him here; </l>
        <l>His little frailty sure you can forgive, </l>
        <l>And Impudence you know deserves to live; </l>
        <l>You may be merciful, though you are Foes, </l>
        <l>Since to your Rage at once he did Expose </l>
        <l>All he held dear, to <hi>Lead you by the Nose</hi>. </l>
