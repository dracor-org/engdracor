        <l>HOw ere th'intents and appetites of men </l>
        <l>Are different as their faces, how and when </l>
        <l>T'employ their actions, yet all without strife </l>
        <l>Meet in this point, Any thing for a Quiet Life. </l>
        <l>Nor is there one I think that's hither come </l>
        <l>For his delight, but would finde Peace at home </l>
        <l>On any terms. The Lawyer does not cease </l>
        <l>To talk himself into a sweat with pain, </l>
        <l>And so his Fees buy Quiet, 'tis his gain: </l>
        <l>The poor man does endure the scorching Sun, </l>
        <l>And feels no weariness his day-labor done, </l>
        <l>So his Wife entertain him with a smile, </l>
        <l>And thank his travail, though she slept the while: </l>
        <l>This being in men of all conditions true, </l>
        <l>Does give our Play a Name; and if to you </l>
        <l>It yield Content, and usual Delight, </l>
        <l>For our parts we shall sleep secure to night. </l>

            <p>Can you not see your error? that having buried so good a wife not a moneth since; one that, to speak the truth, had all those excellencies which our books have onely feign'd to make a compleat Wife, most exactly in her in practice, and to marry a Girl of fifteen; one bred up i'th Court, that by all consonancy of reason, is like to cross your estate: why, one new Gown of hers when 'tis paid for, will eat you out the keeping of a bountiful Christmas. I am asham'd of you, for you shall make too dear a proof of it, I fear; that in the election of a Wife, as in a project of War, to erre but once, is to be undone for ever. </p>

            <p>So it does, and can finde nought to extenuate your fault, but your dotage: you are a man well sunck in years, and to graft such a yong blossom into your Stock, is the next way to make every carnal eye bespeak your injury. Troth I pity her too, she was not made to wither and go out by painted fires, that yields her no more heat, then to be lodg'd in some bleak Banquetting-house i'th dead of Winter, and what follows then? your shame, and the ruine of your children, and there's the end of a rash bargain. </p>

            <p>With your pardon, that she is young is true; but that Discretion ha's gone beyond her years. and overtane those of maturer age, does more improve her goodness. I confess she was bred at Court, but so retiredly, that (as still the best in some place is to be learnt there) so her life did rectifie it self more by the Court Chappel, then by the Office of the Revels: best of all vertues are <pb xml:id="ep000634-004-a"/>to be found at Court, and where you meet with writings contrary to this known truth, they are framed by men that never were so happy to be planted there to know it: for the difference between her youth and mine, if you will read a Matrons sober staidness in her eye, and all the other grave demeanor fitting the Governess of a House, you'l then confess there's no disparity between us. </p>

Item, such a day being at the Artillery-Garden, one of my neighbors in courtesie to salute me with his Musquet, set a fire my Fustian and Apes Breeches. Such a day I lost fifty pound in hugger-mugger, at Dice at the Quest-house.

            <p>Sir, I do now ingeniously perceive why you said lately, somewhat I should write would be my undoing, meaning (as I take it) setting my hand to this Assurance: Oh good Sir, shall I pass away my Birth-right? Oh remember there is a malediction denounc't against it in Holy Writ: will you for her pleasure, the Inheritance of Desolation leave to your posterity? think how compassionate the creatures of the field that onely live on the wilde benefits of Nature, are unto their yong ones; think likewise you may have more children by this woman, and by this act you undo them too: 'tis a strange president this, to see an obedient son laboring good counsel to the father! But know Sir, that the spirits of my Great-Grandfather and your Father moves at this present in me, and what they bequeath'd you, on your Death-bed they charge you not to give away in the dalliance of a womans bed: Good Sir, let it not be thought presumption in me, that I have continued my speech unto this length, the cause sir, is urgent, and believe it you shall finde her Beauty as malevolent unto you, as a red morning <pb xml:id="ep000634-019-a"/>that doth still foretel a foul day to follow: Oh Sir, keep your Land, keep that to keep your Name immortal, and you shall see All that her Malice and proud Will procures, </p>
            <p>Shall shew her ugly heart, but hurt not yours. </p>
