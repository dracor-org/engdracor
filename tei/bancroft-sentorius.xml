        <l>Oft beat the brave, or battel with the Air: </l>
        <l>So our Gallant forc'd by his Friends to write, </l>
        <l>Now dreads his Fate which must be known this Night; </l>
        <l>Storm'd by his Friends they swore him into rage, </l>
        <l>And forc'd him fight the Hydra of the Stage: </l>
        <l>Compell'd he sigh'd and said like Phaeton, </l>
        <l>He aims at Wit, as t'other at the Sun, </l>
        <l>That he relies on what so oft is told, </l>
        <l>Fortune assists the brave, and Court's the bold; </l>
        <l>But if from Fortun's slippery Wheel he's hurl'd </l>
        <l>From Wits vast Empire to the lower World, </l>
        <l>Fate was unkind she would no pity show, </l>
        <l>Be doom'd by her, but doubly damn'd by you. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <byline>By Mr. Ravenscroft. </byline>
        <l>OVR Poet to the learned Criticks does submit, </l>
        <l>But scorns those little Vermine in the Pit, </l>
        <l>Who noise and nonsense vent instead of Wit: </l>
        <l>Those Aierie empty Sparks that know no more </l>
        <l>Than how to dress and railly with a Whore; </l>
        <l>Nay all they say to 'em is perfect cant, </l>
        <l>And Vizord still runs down the weak Gallant: </l>
        <l>Vext at her Repartee, he stroaks his Wig, </l>
        <l>And cries, Dam me, you Whore you, I'll unrig: </l>
        <l>Then cursing her, he leaves her to the rest </l>
        <l>O'th' Fops— </l>
        <l>Or tears a Hood and Scarf to make a jeast. </l>
        <l>Whence have these silly Monsters their pretence, </l>
        <l>That they should Iudges be of Wit and Sence? </l>
        <l>These Gnats about a Poets Ears may swarm, </l>
        <l>But want a Sting to do him any harm. </l>
