        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WE might well call this short Mock-play of ours </l>
        <l>A Posie made of Weeds instead of Flowers; </l>
        <l>Yet such have been presented to your noses, </l>
        <l>And there are such, I fear, who thought 'em Roses. </l>
        <l>Would some of 'em were here, to see, this night, </l>
        <l>What stuff it is in which they took delight. </l>
        <l>Here, brisk insipid Blades, for wit, let fall </l>
        <l>Sometimes dull sence; but oft'ner, none at all: </l>
        <l>There, strutting Heroes, with a grim-fac'd train, </l>
        <l>Shall brave the Gods, in King Cambyses vain. </l>
        <l>For (changing Rules, of late, as if men writ </l>
        <l>In spite of Reason, Nature, Art, and Wit) </l>
        <l>Our Poets make us laugh at Tragoedy, </l>
        <l>And with their Comedies they make us cry. </l>
        <l>Now, Critiques, do your worst, that here are met; </l>
        <l>For, like a Rook I have hedg'd in my Bet. </l>
        <l>If you approve; I shall assume the state </l>
        <l>Of those high-flyers whom I imitate: </l>
        <l>And justly too; for I will shew you more </l>
        <l>Than ever they vouchsaf'd to shew before: </l>
        <l>I will both represent the feats they do, </l>
        <l>And give you all their reasons for 'em too. </l>
        <l>Some honour to me will from this arise. </l>
        <l>But if, by my endeavours, you grow wise, </l>
        <l>And what was once so prais'd you now despise; </l>
        <l>Then I'l cry out, swell'd with Poetique rage, </l>
        <l>'Tis I, <hi>John Lacy</hi>, have reform'd your Stage. </l>

Look you, Sir, the chief hindge of this Play, upon which the whole Plot moves and turns, and that causes the variety of all the several accidents, which, you know, are the thing in Nature that make up the grand refinement of a Play, is, that I suppose two Kings to be of the same place: as, for example, at Brentford; for I love to write familiarly. Now the people having the same relations to 'em both, the same affections, the same duty, the same obedience, and all that; are divided among themselves in point of devoir and interest, how to behave themselves equally between 'em: these Kings differing sometimes in particular; though, in the main, they agree.

The one is by civility, by insinuation, good language, and all that, to— a— in a manner, steal your plaudit from the courtesie of the Auditors: the other, by making use of some certain personal things, which may keep a hank upon such censuring persons, as cannot otherways, A gad, in nature, be hindred from being too free with their tongues. To which end, my first Prologue is, that I come out in a long black Veil, and a great huge Hang-man behind me, with a Furr'd-cap, and his Sword drawn; and there tell 'em plainly, That if, out of good nature, they will not like my Play, why I gad, I'l e'en kneel down, and he shall cut my head off.

        <l>They every Scene with so much wit did store </l>
        <l>That who brought any in, went out with more: </l>
        <l>But this new way of wit does so surprise, </l>
        <l>Men lose their wits in wond'ring where it lyes. </l>
        <l>If it be true, that Monstrous births presage </l>
        <l>The following mischiefs that afflicts the Age, </l>
        <l>And sad disasters to the State proclaim; </l>
        <l>Plays, without head or tail, may do the same. </l>
        <l>Wherefore, for ours, and for the Kingdoms peace, </l>
        <l>May this prodigious way of writing cease. </l>
        <l>Let's have, at least, once in our lives, a time </l>
        <l>When we may hear some Reason, not all Rhyme: </l>
        <l>We have these ten years felt its Influence; </l>
        <l>Pray let this prove a year of Prose and Sence. </l>
