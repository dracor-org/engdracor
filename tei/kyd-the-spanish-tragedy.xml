          <speaker>Ghoast. </speaker>
          <l>WHen this eternall substance of my soule, </l>
          <l>Did liue imprisond in my wanton flesh: </l>
          <l>Ech in their function seruing others need, </l>
          <l>I was a Courtier in the Spanish Court. </l>
          <l>My name was Don Andrea, my discent </l>
          <l>Though not ignoble, yet inferiour far </l>
          <l>To gratious fortunes of my tender youth: </l>
          <l>For there in prime and pride of all my yeeres, </l>
          <l>By duteous seruice and deseruing loue, </l>
          <l>In secret I possest a worthy dame, </l>
          <l>Which hight sweet Bel-imperia by name. </l>
          <l>But in the haruest of my sommer ioyes, </l>
          <l>Deaths winter nipt the blossomes of my blisse, </l>
          <l>Forcing diuorce betwixt my loue and me. </l>
          <l>For in the late conflict with Portingale, </l>
          <l>My valour drew me into dangers mouth, </l>
          <l>Till life to death made passage through my wounds. </l>
          <l>When I was slaine, my soule descended straight, </l>
          <l>To passe the flowing streame of Acheron: </l>
          <l>But churlish Charon only boatman there, </l>
          <l>Said that my rites of buriall not performde, </l>
          <l>I might not sit amongst his passengers. </l>
          <l>Ere Sol had slept three nights in Thetis lap, </l>
          <l>And slakte his smoaking Charriot in her cloud: </l>
          <l>By Don Horatio our knight Marshals sonne, </l>
          <l>My funerals and obsequies were done. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000120-003-a"/>
          <l>Then was the Feriman of hell content, </l>
          <l>To passe me ouer to the slimie strond, </l>
          <l>That leades to fell Auernus ougly waues: </l>
          <l>There pleasing Cerberus with honied speech, </l>
          <l>I past the perils of the formost porch. </l>
          <l>Not farre from hence amidst ten thousand soules, </l>
          <l>Sate Minos, Eacus, and Rhadamant, </l>
          <l>To whome no sooner gan I make approch, </l>
          <l>To craue a pasport for my wandring Ghost: </l>
          <l>But Minos ingrauen leaues of Lotterie, </l>
          <l>Drew forth the manner of my life and death. </l>
          <l>This knight (quoth he) both liu'd and died in loue: </l>
          <l>And for his loue tried fortune of the warres, </l>
          <l>And by warres fortune lost both loue and life. </l>
          <l>Why then said Eacus, conuay him hence, </l>
          <l>To walke with louers in our fields of loue: </l>
          <l>And spend the course of euerlasting time, </l>
          <l>Vnder greene mirtle trees and Cipresse shades. </l>
          <l>No, no, said Rhadamant, it were not well, </l>
          <l>With louing soules to place a Martialist, </l>
          <l>He died in warre, and must to martiall fields: </l>
          <l>Where wounded Hector liues in lasting paine, </l>
          <l>And Achilles mermedons do scoure the plaine. </l>
          <l>Then Minos mildest censor of the three, </l>
          <l>Made this deuice to end the difference. </l>
          <l>Send him (quoth he) to our infernall King: </l>
          <l>To dome him as best seemes his Maiestie: </l>
          <l>To this effect my pasport straight was drawne. </l>
          <l>In keeping on my way to Plutos Court, </l>
          <l>Through dreadfull shades of euer glooming night: </l>
          <l>I saw more sights then thousand tongues can tell, </l>
          <l>Or pennes can write, or mortall harts can think. </l>
          <l>Three waies there were, that on the right hand side, </l>
          <l>Was ready way vnto the foresaid fields, </l>
          <l>Where louers liue, and bloudie Martialists, </l>
          <l>But either sort containd within his bounds. </l>
          <l>The left hand path declining fearfully, </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000120-003-b"/>
          <l>Was ready downfall to the deepest hell. </l>
          <l>Where bloudie furies shakes their whips of steele, </l>
          <l>And poore Ixion turnes an endles wheele. </l>
          <l>Where Vsurers are choakt with melting golde, </l>
          <l>And wantons are imbraste with ougly snakes: </l>
          <l>And murderers grone with neuer killing wounds, </l>
          <l>And periurde wights scalded in boyling lead, </l>
          <l>And all soule sinnes with torments ouerwhelmd▪ </l>
          <l>Twixt these two waies, I trod the middle path, </l>
          <l>Which brought me to the faire Elizian greene. </l>
          <l>In midst whereof there standes a stately Towre, </l>
          <l>The walles of brasse, the gates of Adamant. </l>
          <l>Heere finding Pluto with his Proserpine, </l>
          <l>I shewed my pasport humbled on my knee. </l>
          <l>Whereat faire Proserpine began to smile, </l>
          <l>And begd that onely she might giue my doome. </l>
          <l>Pluto was pleasd and sealde it with a kisse. </l>
          <l>Forthwith (Reuenge) she rounded thee in th'eare, </l>
          <l>And bad thee lead me through the gates of Hor: </l>
          <l>Where dreames haue passage in the silent night. </l>
