        <head>To my singular honest Stationer, Mr. Robert Mylbourne, at his shop in decimo sexto, by the south doore of Pauls. </head>
        <p>AS you are a true Booke-seller, you must approue your selfe a true Booke-restorer: and therfore by booke or by crooke, see that you send backe my Book. And yet not my Booke. For it was but a borrowed Booke, for which my promise and credit lye in mortgage to the Author, the Schoolemaster of Hadley, who with some difficulty lent it me, hauing no other coppy of this English Lesson which. he prepared for a By-exercise for his schollars at the last Carneual. He told me that hee huddled it vp in hast, and that it being onely an essay of his owne faculty, and of the actiuity of his tenderlings, he was loath it should come vnder <pb xml:id="ep000052-003-a"/>any other eye, then of those Parents and domestique friends who fauourably beheld it, when it was represented by the children. And therefore, I must be, and am tender of suffering it to wander I know not whither, by the out let of your friends hand: whom as I know not, so I cannot challenge of any trust; but require restitution of you, as the Author doth of me. So, expecting without delay, the returne of this bird into the cage, I end with a threat, that if you faile, you must looke to haue this Comedy turned into a Tragedy, and, for detaining this booke, to haue your name set on the backe side of my booke. Whereto I adde yet a deeper curse, that next time you meet with good fellowes in Epping Forrest, you may not be so happy, as to feed them with nuts in stead of money. </p>

        </opener>
        <p>I pray you extend your loue so farre to your friend, and your friends friend, as to thinke that neither the first will defraud you of your borrowed Booke, nor the second expose the Author to any inconuenience. The truth is my friend, vpon the sight of this Morall, Scholasticall, Theatricall Treatise, protested that the Author should receiue much right in being thus wronged; and vpon sufficient bond vndertooke to saue me harmelesse if I made it more publique then euer was intended. And withall hee armed me with a legall defence, that, if I restored tenne sold for the principall, the Author (notwithstanding his modesty) could frame no iust quarrell against me or you at the barre of iustice <pb xml:id="ep000052-004-a"/>or reputation. Accordingly he incouraged me (if Master Schoolemaster of Hadley should schoole you for promise-breach) to stop his mouth with a dozen of chicken hatcht vnder his owne henne. </p>
        <p>I pray you therefore in stead of his owne single written Coppy, coppy him with this packet of his owne mettall stamped and multiplied by the Printers Alchimy. </p>
        <p>The worst I heare, is, that hee will complaine to Apollo of me that I haue proclaimed abroad his priuate Shrouing. For which I haue a defence from the Authors owne penne, that Apollos solemne visitation begins with Proclamation. Act. 1. Scen. ultima And, I trow Proclamations are intended to flye abroad in print. So in hope that I shall receiue, if not thanks, yet pardon from him. I rather take, then begge, leaue to remaine still </p>

What, shall I after Philoponus into the temple? <pb n="11" xml:id="ep000052-009-b"/>'Tis with the latest now. And (to confesse the truth) alas I dare not there appeare to present my selfe before Apollos Altar. Nor haue I now the boldnesse to looke my deare Philoponus in the face. His setled countenance and graue gesture giue a cheeke vnto my leuity. His very silence reades vnto mee a lecture of reprehension. My passions so deepe inthrald another way, bid mee now rather to withdraw from such society, and hide my selfe in shades and groues, and solitude. </p>
              <p>Alas Amphibius, though hauing tide himselfe to the mast of safety by the bonds of temperance, yet breaketh loose, and leapes into the sea of danger. Alas hee cannot hold. This Sirens song is so attractiue. I yeeld, I come And yet how can I? shall I runne away from the worthy trade whereto I am bound apprentise? My name is inrold in Apollos register, and shall I rase it out, and be reckoned among the fugitiues and renegados? Not so. And yet and yet it will be so. O how my very booke seemes now a burthen vnto me, and that which heretofore did eleuate my soule, and giue it wings to flye aloft, sweet contemplation of nature and of arts, that now alas layes on me the heauy load of vpbraiding, I flye, I flye, I hast into the by waies of these thickest groues </p>

My true riches treasured vp in the cabinet of this breast, no lurching hand by stealth, no robbing rouer by force can seise vpon. My Father hath no land to leaue me. I thinke his meane estate is the better meanes of my happinesse.

O the diuine power of vnbred conscience? Sutable to this is that of Seneca. Quid prodest non habere conscium habenti conscientiam? When Amphibius and I discoursed on this point at our priuate reading of Seneca, I remember how affectionately he would take the booke into his bosome, and hugge it, and protest that this one sentence is able to make vs honest men.
