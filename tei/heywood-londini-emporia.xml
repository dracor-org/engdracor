        <p>THE Triumphs and Sollemnities of this Day, are dedicated and deuoted to this your happy Inauguration, which as Time warranteth, so Custome confirmeth: And herein hath this City a Priority aboue any Metropolis in Europe: For Rome it selfe when the Monarchy of the world was vnder her sole Iurisdiction, neuer receiued her <hi>Praetor, Consul</hi>, or Dictator with the like Pompe and Sollemnity: yet is it deriued vnto you from Antiquity, and I wish it may continue to all Posterity. And Sir, for your owne part I am not altogether vnacquainted with your Modesty, which would willingly haue euaded this honourable trouble, but now you finde that the Condition of Honour is such, that it inquireth after him who regardeth it not, courteth him that affecteth it not, and followeth him fastest who most flyeth it, as knowing that it is not the Place which maketh the Person, but the Person which maketh the Place truely Honourable, which now hath inuited you to your merit, howsoeuer against <pb xml:id="ep000068-003-a"/>your minds, according to that of the 〈…〉 her <hi>Lyui. Decad. Lib. 4. Gratia &amp; honos opportuniora interdum non cupientibus sunt. </hi>Advising you withall of this your high Office and Calling, to obserue the necessary adiuncts thereto belonging, namely, Affability with Authority and with your Sword and <hi>Power, Commiseration </hi>and ●itty: Neither can I wish you a better President to imitate then your Predecessor, of whom I may say, <q>
            <l>Semper honos nomenque suum laudesque manebunt. </l>
          </q>Not questioning but that wee may speake the like of your selfe, and the two worthy Gentlemen the Sheriffes, your Assistants, when Time, shall summon you to resigne your places to these which shall succeed you: And thus I humbly take my leaue of your Lordship, with this Sentence borrowed from <foreign xml:lang="lat">Seneca, Bonum est laudari, sed praestantius est esse laudabilem. </foreign>

        <p>
          <hi>MErcatura, i. </hi>Merchandise, the Greekes call Emporia, and Emporos a Merchant, the <hi>Hebrewes Meker</hi>. From hence (it seemes) the Poets call Hermes (the Sonne of Iupiter and Maia) Mercury, making him the God of Merchants and Merchandise. The mistery whereof hath in the ancient times beene held glorious, and the professors thereof illustrious as those, by whose Aduenture and Industry vnknowne Countries haue beene discouered, Friendship with forreigne Princes contracted, barbarous Nations to humane gentlenesse and courtesie reduced, and all such vsefull commodities in forreigne Climats abounding, and in their owne wanting, made conducible and frequent, nay, many of them haue not beene onely the Erectors of braue and goodly structures, but the Founders of great and famous Cities: (for so sayth <hi>Plutarch in Solon</hi>) Merchandise it selfe, <ref target="A03229-e540-b"/>
          <note corresp="A03229-e540-a" place="margin">
            <hi>Lib. 〈…〉 </hi>
          </note>according to Aristotle, consisteth of three things, <hi>Nauigation, Foeneration</hi>, and Negotiation, all which are commendably approued, if considerately and conscionably vsed. </p>
        <p>Eight Offices of Piety are in a Merchant required. 1. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Rectitudo conscientiae</foreign>, Vprightnesse of Conscience, which <pb xml:id="ep000068-004-a"/>is most acceptable to the Creator, (and therefore ought to be more prized by the Creature) then any vaine-glorious Title: as stiled by our best Theologists, the indulgent Mother of all Vertues whatsoever. 2. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Simulationis &amp; dissimulationis seclusio, i. </foreign>A seclusion or separation from all dissembling or equivocation. 3. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Fraudem deuitare, i. </foreign>To abandon all fraud or deceite in bargaining, but in all Couenants and Contracts to obserue truth and irreprooueable fidelity. 4. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Iustitiam exerceri, i. </foreign>To exercise Iustice: which excludeth the practice of Iuiury, Extortion, and Oppression. 5. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Superbiam deponere</foreign>, To lay by all pride, for (as diuine Plato sayth) <hi>Hee who knoweth himselfe best, esteemeth of himselfe the least: </hi>Wee reade also in Socrates, that pride is a vice which of young men ought to be carefully auoided, of old men vtterly abiured, of all men suspected and feared. 6. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Beneficientia vti, i. </foreign>Out of his abundance to bee open-handed vnto all, but especially vnto the poore and indigent. 7. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Auaritiam fraenare, i. </foreign>To bridle the insatiate desire of getting, for the auaritious man wanteth as well what he hath, as what he hath not: who hath great trauaile in gathering Wealth, more danger in keeping it, much Law in defending it, most torment in departing from it. 8. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sollicitudines resecare, i. </foreign>To renounce all care and trouble of minde, which may hinder Diuine contemplation, but rather to fixe his thoughts vpon that Heauenly treasure which the Moath corrupteth not, the Fire cannot waste, nor the Sea wraeke: All these things desireable being knowne to be eminent in your Lordship, was the maine inducement to intitle this present Show by this apt Denomination, <hi>Londini Emporia</hi>: <ref target="A03229-e720-b"/>

        <p>Concerning this Company of the Cloath-workers, none hath beene more ancient, as claiming their place from the first institution, and though in count the last of Twelue, yet eueryway equall with the first or any: the reasons are pregnant, and briefely these: The Nobility of the Land are called Pares, (that is) Peeres. For their parity and equality, as hauing preualent voyces in the high Session, or Court of Parliament. The two famous Vniuersities are equall Sisters: neyther can one claime priority aboue the other, yet because they cannot be named at once, those of Cambridge say, Cambridge and Oxford: Those of Oxford say, Oxford and Cambridge, which neither addeth nor detracteth from the other: In all numbers there is a compulsiue necessity of order, onely for method sake, not that we can properly say, this Figure in it selfe is better then that, being all of them onely helpers to make vp an Account: since that all the Lord Maiors of this honourable City: (from which of the Twelue Companies soeuer they be Elected) beare one Sword, receiue one Power, and retaine like Authority: (There being no difference at all in place, office, or in granting Priuiledges or Immunities &amp;c.) I hold them all equall without difference, or if any shall claime priority or precedence aboue the rest, let it bee conferr'd vpon that which breedeth the best Magistrates, and of this Company haue beene these after named, not of the least Eminence, as Sir <hi>William Hart</hi>, L. Maior Anno 1559. Sir <hi>Rowland Hayward An. </hi>1570. who was twice L. Maior at the least. Sir <hi>Iames Howell An. </hi>1574. Sir <hi>Edward Osborne An. </hi>1583. <hi>Thomas Skinner</hi>, who dyed before hee was Knighted, 1596. Sir <hi>Iohn Spencer An. </hi>1594. Sir <hi>Michael Moseley </hi>1599. Sir <hi>Iohn Watts </hi>1606. And now this present yeare 1633. the Right Honourable <hi>Ralph Freeman</hi>: Neyther is it the least Honour to this right Worshipfull Fraternity, that it pleased Royall King Iames, (of sacred memory) <pb xml:id="ep000068-005-a"/>besides diuers others of the Nobility, to enter into the freedome and brother-hood of this Company. </p>

(From whence hee hath sundry attributes and denominations conferr'd vpon him) but he is also termed the god of Barter, buying, selling, and commerce in all Merchandise whatsoeuer. </p>
        <p>Wee reade of two onely imployd by the gods in Embassie vnto men, namely, Iris and Mercury: The difference betwixt their imployments is, that Iris (for the most part commanded by Iuno, (as being her chiefe Attendant) and neuer by the rest of the gods, vnlesse to fore-tell Warre, Famine, Pestilence, or some strange Disaster: And Mercury <pb xml:id="ep000068-007-b"/>was negotiated but in sports, pastimes, marriage Feasts, sollemne meetings, Showes, Ouations, Triumphs, spectacles of the like nature, and therefore more proper to this Dayes imployment. He is figured like a young man, fresh coloured and beardlesse: In his right hand holding a Golden Purse, in his left a Caduzcaem, (a Rod with two Snakes twined and internoded about it,) their Heads meeting at the top, and their Tayles at the bottome, which the Aegyptians held to be an Embleame of Peace: and in ancient dayes Great men imployde in the affaires of State, or forreigne Embassies, boare such Staues, from whence they were called Caducaeatores: Hee weares Wings vpon his Hat and Heeles, intimating his Celerity: and behinde him stands a Cocke, denoting his Vigilancy: so much for the person, I come now to his Speech. </p>

        <p>Which is a curious and neately framed Architect, beautified with many proper and becomming Ornaments: <ref target="A03229-e3590-b"/>

            <hi>The Show Land.</hi>
          </note>bearing the Title of <hi>The Bower of Blisse</hi>. An Embleame of that future Happinesse, which not onely all iust and vpright Magistrates, but euery good man, of what condition or quality soeuer in the course of his life, especially aimeth at: I dwell not on the description thereof, I will onely illustrate the purpose for the which it was intended: This Pageant is adorned with foure persons, which represent the foure Cardinall vertues, which are behoouefull vnto all who enter into any eminent place or Office. <hi>Prudence, Temperance Iustice</hi>, and Fortitude, which are so concatinated amongst themselues that the one cannot subsist without the other. </p>
        <p>The first Prudence, Reformeth Abuses past, ordreth affaires present, and fore-seeth dangers future: Further (as Cicero obserues) Iustice without Prudence is resolu'd into <hi>Cruelty, Temperance </hi>into <hi>Fury, Fortitude </hi>into Tyranny. </p>
        <p>Next Temperance, which as Hermes sayth, is Rich in losses: Confident in perills, Prudent in assaults, and happy in it selfe. As a man cannot be Temporate vnlesse he be Prudent, so none can be truely valiant vnlesse he be Temperate, neyther can Iustice exist without Temperance— since no man can be truely iust, who hath not his brest free from all purturbations. </p>
        <p>Then Iustice (which according to Cicero) is the badge of Vertue, the staffe of Peace, the maintenance of Honour. Moreouer, Iustice and Order are the preseruers <pb xml:id="ep000068-009-a"/>of the Worlds peace, the iust Magistrate is in his word Faithfull, in his thought sincere, in his heart Vpright, without feare of any but God and his Prince, without hate of any but the wicked and irregular. </p>
        <p>Last Fortitude, which (as Epictetus obserues) is the companion of Iustice, and neuer contendeth but in Rrighteous Actions, it contemneth Perill, despiseth Calamities, and conquers Death, briefely Fortitude without Prudence is but <hi>Rashnes, Prudence </hi>without Iustice is but <hi>Craftines, Iuststice </hi>without Temperance but <hi>Tyrany, Temperance </hi>without Fortitude but Folly. </p>
        <p>Amongst the rest of the Persons placed in this structure, are the three Theologicall Vertues, <hi>Faith, Hope</hi>, and Charity, as hand-maides attending to conduct all such pious and religious Magistrates, the way to the caelestiall Bower of Blisse, (of which this is but a meere representation and signe) who ayme at that Glorious Place, leaft they anyway deuiate from the true path that leadeth vnto it. I proceede to the Speech. </p>
