        <head>TO CHARLES EARL of DORSET and MIDDLESEX, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesty's Houshold, Lord Lieutenant of Sussex, and one of the most Honourable Privy Council. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Who have been so long and so continually oblig'd by your Lordship, have ever fresh Occasions of acknowledging your Favour and Bounty to me, and cannot be silent of the late great Honour you have done me, in making me the King's Servant; but must publish my Gratitude for that, and all the rest of the great Obligations I have receiv'd. Your Lordship not only makes use of your own Power, but of that which the King has entrusted you with, to do good to Mankind, which you ever delighted in. And as I am apt to believe, that no Man had ever a great Office conferr'd upon him with more Favour from his Prince, so I am well assured no Man ever receiv'd one with a more general liking of the People than your Lordship. Nothing but the Service of so Great and Gracious a <pb xml:id="ep000727-003-a"/>King, who so miraculously redeem'd us, and since makes all our Interests his own, could recompence you for the happy Retirement you might enjoy, and wherein you so much delight. </p>
        <p>This Play, my Lord, I humbly submit to your Lordships Iudgment. I can write nothing worthy of your Acceptance; but I hope your Lordship will give some Indulgence to this, since it was Written during eight Months painful Sickness, wherein all the several Days in which I was able to Write any part of a Scene, amounted not to one Month, except some few which were employ'd in indispensable Business. This is indeed no Excuse in any one who does not Write for Necessities of Life. </p>
        <p>The Play has met with a Kind Reception from all for ought I hear, but some of the late Loyal Poets, above whose Censure I esteem my self; and from some who are still so fond of the Doctrine of <hi>Passive Obedience </hi>and Non-resistance, that they think it a Profanation to bring the very words into a Comedy. </p>
        <p>These are so weak to mistake that for a Point of Divinity, which is indeed a Point of Law; and some of the most vigorous Maintainers of that Doctrine, have seen their Errour, and not only left off professing it, but have wisely and justly Contradicted it in their Practice, <pb xml:id="ep000727-003-b"/>by assisting towards our late wonderful Deliverance. And sure there is no need of any great measure of understanding to find out, that, when the Compact on which Government is founded is broken, and those very Laws destroy'd, which were made to secure the People in their Estates, Liberty and Religion, the Law of Nature must take place, which not only permits, but obliges Mankind to Self-defence. </p>
        <p>I never could Recant in the worst of Times, when my Ruine was design'd, and my Life was sought, and for rear Ten years I was kept from the exercise of that Profession which had afforded me a competent Subsistence, and surely I shall not now do it, when there is a Liberty of speaking Common Sence, which tho' not long since forbidden, is now grown Current. </p>
        <p>I humbly beg your Lordship's Pardon for the trouble of this Epistle, who am, </p>

        <stage xml:id="ep000727-e980">Spoken by Mr. Mountfort. </stage>
        <l>TO what hard Laws you Comick Writers bind, </l>
        <l>Who must at every turn new humour find; </l>
        <l>Tho' the great Masters of the former Age, </l>
        <l>Had all the choice of humour for the Stage: </l>
        <l>And they that plenteous Harvest reap'd so clean, </l>
        <l>Their Successors can little else but glean. </l>
        <l>Frolick, and Cockwood yet were good and new, </l>
        <l>And the Plain-dealer, and Sir Foplin you </l>
        <l>Have seen, and justly have applauded too. </l>
        <l>Our Author some new humour did produce, </l>
        <l>But look not for an unexhausted Cruse. </l>
        <l>The task each day grows harder than before; </l>
        <l>For as good Poets have brought forth great store, </l>
        <l>So Fellows of no Genius, with much Toil, </l>
        <l>Still Sweat for humour, which they always spoil: </l>
        <l>And by their hints good Comick Pens prevent, </l>
        <l>As Whelps stanch Hounds, by foyling of the scent. </l>
        <l>These wretched Poetitos, who got praise </l>
        <l>For writing most <hi>confounded Loyal </hi>Plays, </l>
        <l>With viler, courser Iests than at Bear-Garden, </l>
        <l>And silly Grubstreet Songs worse than <hi>Tom Farthing</hi>. </l>
        <l>If any Noble Patriot did excel </l>
        <l>His own, and Country's Rights defending well, </l>
        <l>These yelping Currs were straight loo'd on to bark, </l>
        <l>On the <hi>deserving Man </hi>to set a mark. </l>
        <l>These abject, fawning Parasites and Knaves, </l>
        <l>since they were such, would have all others Slaves, </l>
        <l>Twas precious Loyalty that was thought fit </l>
        <l>To attone for want of Honesty and Wit. </l>
        <l>No wonder <hi>Common Sence </hi>was all cry'd down, </l>
        <l>And Noise and Nonsence swagger'd thro' the Town. </l>
        <l>Our Author then opprest, would have you know it, </l>
        <l>Was Silenc'd for a Non-conformist Poet: </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000727-005-a"/>
        <l>In those <hi>hard times </hi>he bore the utmost test, </l>
        <l>And now he Swears he's Loyal as the best. </l>
        <l>Now Sirs, since <hi>Common Sence </hi>has won the day, </l>
        <l>Be kind to this, as to his last years Play. </l>
        <l>His Friends stood firmly to him when distress'd; </l>
        <l>He hopes the number is not now decreas'd: </l>
        <l>He found esteem from those he valued most, </l>
        <l>Proud of his Friends, he of his Foes could boast. </l>
        <l>To all you. <hi>Bury Sparks</hi>, he bid me say </l>
        <l>That every Part is Fiction in his Play; </l>
        <l>
          <hi>Particular Reflections </hi>there are none, </l>
        <l>Our Poet knows not one in all your Town. </l>
        <l>If any has so very little Wit </l>
        <l>To think a Fop's dress can his Person fit, </l>
        <l>E'en let him take it, and make much of it. </l>

I knew Fletcher, my Friend Fletcher, and his Maid Ioan: Well, I shall never forget him, I have Supp'd with him, at his House, on the Bankside: He lov'd a fat Loyn of Pork of all things in the World: and Ioan, his Maid, had her Beerglass of Sack; and we all kiss'd her, i'faith, and were as merry as pass'd. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <stage xml:id="ep000727-e49730">Spoken by Mrs. Mountfort. </stage>
        <l>I Was our <hi>Authors Advocate </hi>last year, </l>
        <l>And then ye very gentle did appear. </l>
        <l>To him ye now should more Indulgence show, </l>
        <l>Eight months he has been sick, and well we know </l>
        <l>How very little a sick man can do. </l>
        <l>But could he Write with never so much Wit, </l>
        <l>He must despair of seeing a full Pit: </l>
        <l>Most of our constant Friends have left the Town, </l>
        <l>Bravely to serve their King and Country gone. </l>
        <l>Our unfrequented Theatre must mourn, </l>
        <l>Till the <hi>Brave Youths Triumphantly </hi>return. </l>
        <l>Soft Men of Peace enough are left at home, </l>
        <l>Daily to cram our House, if they'd but come: </l>
        <l>They eagerly elsewhere in throngs resort, </l>
        <l>Crowding for Places in the well fill'd Court. </l>
        <l>Here one who has been fifty years a Knave, </l>
        <l>Strives for a Place, with one foot in the Grave. </l>
        <l>Another there, who did what e're he cou'd </l>
        <l>Against the Soveraign Author of our good. </l>
        <l>Some who rode Westward at least ten miles down, </l>
        <l>Some made <hi>Blue Coats </hi>at him, and staid in Town. </l>
        <l>All these would have preferment, as if they </l>
        <l>Had to this Glorious Change prepar'd the way: </l>
        <l>Thus there are more admirers to each place, </l>
        <l>Than e're a Celebrated Beauty has. </l>
        <l>And they who cannot that advancement gain, </l>
        <l>They think their mighty Merits ought t' attain, </l>
        <l>Steal to some <hi>Grumbling Club</hi>, and there complain. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000727-036-a"/>
        <l>Pox on't, things go not well, I'll change my side, </l>
        <l>I thought they would for my great Worth provide. </l>
        <l>Pray have less Vanity, and learn more Wit, </l>
        <l>Come here, we've Places for you all most fit </l>
        <l>Within our empty Boxes and our Pit. </l>
        <l>But you who use to hiss, pray keep away, </l>
        <l>And try to Write before you damn a Play; </l>
        <l>'Twill then so hard a task to you appear, </l>
        <l>You will not have the Heart to be severe. </l>
