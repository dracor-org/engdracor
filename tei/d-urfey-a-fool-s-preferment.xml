            <head>TO THE HONOURABLE CHARLES Lord MORPETH. </head>
            <opener>
              <salute>My dear LORD, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am in Debt so many ways, for Obligations to your Self, and Noble Family, that, with all the Gratitude I have, I am puzzled in finding occasions to express my Thanks; be pleased therefore to receive in a Dedication of this flight Piece, my Hearts true Acknowledgments, and as true an Endeavour to dievrt you, by Reading a Comedy, which was only design'd to please such as look on this sort of Dramatick Poesie, as you do, with Judgment and good Humour. I have studied these things long enough to know the Humor of the Town, and what is proper for Diversion; but I cannot always bring my Inclinations to flatter the (<hi>Would be WITS</hi>,) nor spare the exposing a notorious Vice, thô the price of a Third Day were the fatal consequence of such an Indiscretion: It is, and shall be, enough for me at any time, if some few of the many Noble and Worthy Persons, that did me the Honour to appear for me, in spite of the Party that was malitiously made by some eminent Gamesters of both Sexes, who thought themselves touch'd: If such as your Lordship, and those others of my unbyass'd Friends, will please to think it worth their liking, and alluding to a late Honourable, and Renowned Author; I Declare, <q>
                <pb xml:id="ep000546-003-a"/>
                <l>If You, and Others, I omit to Name, </l>
                <l>Approve my Lines, I count your Censure, Fame. </l>
              </q>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Play, I will only say this of it, the first hint was taken from an old Comedy of Fletcher's; and as it was improv'd, and several new Humours added, it was generally lik'd before the Acting. I knew Basset was a Game, only proper for Persons of great Fortunes; and therefore I thought, that a wholsome Satyr of this kind might have oblig'd some Country-Gentlemen; or Citizens of small Estates, whose Wives ne're heeding the approaching Ruin, took only care, they might have the Honour, to be seen at Play with Quality. But some certain, very nice, Persons, especially one, took it so to Heart, that dear Basset should be expos'd, that my honest Intentions were quite frustrated, and that the Piece might be sure to be ruin'd, their Majesties were told, it was so obscene, that it was not fit to be Acted; when, I can prove, there has not, these seven years, been any Comedy so free from it; and some good Judges were pleas'd to Declare, they thought that, the only Reason some People had to find fault. Obscenity is a thing of that abominable Nature, that unless it be detected so throughly, that it may be punished, it were better not heeded at all, (especially, by a Lady) who, in my Opinion, being too Witty in such a Discovery, will only give People to understand, how well skill'd She is in the Matter. </p>
            <p>My LORD, I most Humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for this Digression, thô I could not well Publish the Play, without some Defence in this kind; but I have done with 'em now, and the hottest Censurer shall at leisure cool of himself: I will only rally my own ill Fortune, and say, with that admirable French Moralist; <hi>Fortune, Ie me repends de t'voir suivie, &amp; cognoissant que tu ne peux chos. du monde advoüë que la vertu est le seul port où les hommes peuvent-trouver leur veritable tranquillité. </hi>

            <pb xml:id="ep000546-003-b"/>
            <p>A Sentence, which, I'm sure, your Lordship throughly understands, having been with choicest Care Bred, and Learned in the nicest Rudiments of Morality, Wit, and Religion, and therefore skill'd in what concerns all Mankind in general, as well as Poets, who are Condemn'd to Traffick with all sort of Humours, and to be oblig'd to such as will own themselves pleas'd, with what they like. A Fatigue, which I can the better bear, because it offends me little, which way soever it happens, always believing, that, next diverting my Friends, to please my Self, is the best-method; but as my Friends satisfaction takes Place first, I hope this Comedy will not appear distastful to 'em, especially to you, being Corrected, And My Lord, thus Humbly Dedicated, By </p>

            <p>Of which (because it was particularly carp'd at) I desire every one that has more Wit than Malice, to Judge. </p>
            <l>FOnd of his Art; the Poet has to day </l>
            <l>Mistook, and made me mad the silliest way; </l>
            <l>Pride, Wealth, or Wine, may Frenzy often move: </l>
            <l>But that's a strange Brute that runs mad for Love, </l>
            <l>Few now, Thank Heaven, such lewd examples find, </l>
            <l>'Tis forfeiting the Charter of our Kind; </l>
            <l>Shall Men have all, and Women no remorse? </l>
            <l>Then let the Cart hereafter drag the Horse. </l>
            <l>Let each Eve wrest the Scripture false, and swear; </l>
            <l>She was not made for Man, but Man for Her; </l>
            <l>No, this had been a most unpardon'd Crime; </l>
            <l>Did not the Lady here repent in time. </l>
            <l>Besides, the Notion's false, for sure no Man </l>
            <l>Can Love so well, and faith no Woman can: </l>
            <l>'Tis true, degrees of Madness all may fit, </l>
            <l>Some with too much, some with too little Wit, </l>
            <l>I have been Mad, or I should ne'r have Writ. </l>
            <l>'Tis a Disease that Reigns in every station, </l>
            <l>First, amongst Gamesters I have found occasion, </l>
            <l>Somtimes to make a pretty Observation; </l>
            <l>At Hazard I have seen a Witty Lad </l>
            <l>Eat up a Candle, if his luck were bad; </l>
            <l>What think ye, Sirs, Was not that Fellow mad? </l>
            <l>A Lady too, in Tears has left off Play </l>
            <l>(Alas poor Punt,) for losing Sonica,) </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000546-045-b"/>
            <l>But above all, Wine does worst Frenzy raise, </l>
            <l>For then Fop comes, and Whistles at our Plays, </l>
            <l>Calls some one Whore, that to some Spark belongs, </l>
            <l>Who calls him out, and whips him through his Lungs. </l>
            <l>This, on our Nation, a vile blot remains </l>
            <l>None but the Dutch and English take such pains </l>
            <l>To fill the Paunch, and empty all the Brains. </l>
            <l>The last, worst sort too, does your Heads invade, </l>
            <l>That's Whoring, that Vice makes ye all stark mad: </l>
            <l>Not Poverty has power to stop its force, </l>
            <l>Poor Rogues, that ne'r could pay their Alehouse Scores </l>
            <l>Shall brag they've at Command a Leash of Whores. </l>
            <l>To th' Camp those Militant Doxies yearly stray </l>
            <l>Where each mad flitt'ring Fool that's given that way </l>
            <l>To purchase Pox, melts down a whole Months Pay. </l>
            <l>Many more Theams of Madness I could name, </l>
            <l>And quote; indeed too many to our shame. </l>
            <l>But, Sirs, to prove that you have all your Wits, </l>
            <l>Let every Critick, that in Iudgment sits, </l>
            <l>Our Poet to an easie Penance doom, </l>
            <l>Wink at small faults, for all of you have some. </l>
