        <head>TO MY WORTHY AND MVCH ESTEEMED FRIEND, Sir Thomas Richardson, Knight. </head>
        <p>SIR, I now send you your long since promised Celestina, put into English cloathes; I shall intreate you to giue her a friendly welcome, because she is a stranger, and come purposely out of Spaine into these parts, to see you, and kisse your hands. I would not accompany her with my letters of recommendation, whereby she might finde the better reception. For, I must ingeniously confesse, that this your Celestina is not sine scelere; yet must I tell you withall, that she cannot be harboured with you, sine vtilitate. Her life is foule, but her Precepts faire; her example naught, but her Doctrine good; her Coate ragged, but her mind inriched with many a golden Sentence: And therefore take her not as she seemes, but as she is; and the rather, because blacke sheepe haue as good Carcasses as white. You shall finde this booke to be like a Court-Iack, which though it be blacke, yet holds as good liquor as your fairest Flagon of siluer or like the Rod that Brutus offred to Apollo, which was rough and knottie without, but within, all of furbusht gold. The barke is bad, but the tree good. </p>
        <p>Vouchsafe then (gentle Sir) to take a little of this coorse and sowre bread; it may be, your stomack being glutted with more delicate Cates, may take some pleasure to restore your appetite with this homely, though not altogether vnsauoury food. It is good plaine houshold-bread, honest messeline; there is a great deale of Rye in it, but the most part of it is pure Wheate. </p>
        <p>Our Author is but short, yet pithy: not so full of words <pb xml:id="ep000328-003-a"/>as sense; each other line, being a Sentence; vnlike to many of your other Writers, who either with the luxury of their phrases, or superfluity of figures, or superabundancie of ornaments, or other affected guildings of Rhetorick, like vndiscreet Cookes, make their meats either too sweet, or too tarte, too salt, or too full of pepper; whence it hapneth, that like greedy Husbandmen, by inlarging their hand in sowing, they make the haruest thin and barren. It is not as many of your Pamphlets be, like a tree without sap; a bough without frut; a nut without a kernell; flesh without bones; bones without marrow; prickles without a Rose; waxe without honey; straw without wheate; sulfure without Gold; or shels without pearle. But you shall find Sentences worthy to be written, not in fragile paper, but in Cedar, or lasting Cypresse, not with the quill of a Goose, but the feather of a Phoenix; not with inke, but Balsalmum; not with letters of a blacke tincture, but with Characters of Gold and Azure; and deseruing to be read, not only of a lasciuious Clodius, or effeminate Sardanaplus, but of the grauest Cato, or seuerest Stoick. </p>
        <p>All which, though I know to be true, yet doubt I not, but it will meete with some detractors, who like dogges that barke by custome, will exclaime against the whole worke, because some part of it seemeth somewhat more obscene, then may sute with a ciuill stile: which as I not deny; so sithence it is written reprehensiuely, &amp; not instructiuely, I see no reason why they should more abstaine from reading a great deale of good, because they must picke it out of that which is bad; then they should refuse Pearle, because it is fisht for in a froathy sea; or contemne Gold, because it is drawn from a dirty myne; or hate honey, because it is hiued in straw; or loath silke, because it is lapt in soultage. Which kinde of men I can liken to none better, then those of whom Plutarke complainth, who are of so nice a delicacie, that they will not drinke a wholesome potion, vnlesse it be giuen them in a Golden cup, nor weare a winter garment vnlesse it bee wouen of Athenian wooll. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000328-003-b"/>
        <p>The Lacedaemonians, who were as strict liuers, and as great louers of vertue, as any Nation whatsoeuer; would make benefit euen out of vices. But these Criticall companions, being of a depraued disposition, and apt in themselues to be euill, I can compare to nothing better, then the Scarabee, who ouer-flying the most fragrant flowers, chooseth rather to settle in a Cow-shard, then to light vpon a Rose: or Noahs Crow, which flew forth of the Arke, and preying vpon carrion, returned no more. Howsoeuer therfore these rigid reprehenders will not sticke to say of Celestina, that she is like a Crow amongst so many Swans; like a Grashopper amongst so many Nightingales; or like a Paper-blurrer amongst so many famous Writers; yet they that are learned in her language, haue esteemed it (in comparison of others) as Gold, amongst metalls; as the Carbuncle amongst stones; as the Rose amongst flowers; as the Palme amongst trees; as the Eagle amongst Birds; and as the Sunne amongst inferior Lights; In a word, as the choisest &amp; chiefest. But as the light of that great Planet doth hurt sore eies, and comfort those that are sound of sight: So the reading of Celestina, to those that are prophane, is as poyson to their hearts; but to the chaste, and honest minde, a preseruatiue against such inconueniences as occurre in the world. </p>
        <p>And for mine owne part, I am of opinion, that Writers may as well be borne withall, as Painters, who now and then paint those actions that are absurd. As Timomachus painted Medea killing her children; Orestes, murthering his mother Theo, and Parrhasius; Vlysses counterfaited madnes, and Cherephanes, the immodest imbracements of women with men. Which the Spectators beholding, doe not laudare rem, sed; artem not commend the matter which is exprest in the imitation, but the Art and skill of the workeman, which hath so liuely represented what it proposed. In like sort, when wee reade the filthy actions of whores, their wicked conditions, and beastly behauiour, wee are neither to approue them as good, nor to imbrace them as honest, but to commend the Authors iudgement in expressing <pb xml:id="ep000328-004-a"/>his Argument so fit and pat to their dispositions. </p>
        <p>Nor doe I see any more reason, why a man should proue a Villaine by reading of other mens villanies, then a man should grow hard-fauored, by looking Thirsites in the face, or a foole, for viewing Will Summers picture: But might rather grow as the Lacedaemonians did by their slaues drunkennesse, to a detestation of so foule a sinne. When therefore thou shalt reade of Celestina, as of a notorious Bawd; of Sempronio and Parmeno, as of false seruants; of Elicia and Areusa, as of cunning queanes and profest whores; of Centurio, as of a swaggring Ruffian, and common whore-master; of Calisto and Melibea, as of vndiscreet and foolish Louers. And so in the rest, learne thereby to distinguish betweene good and bad, and praise the Author, though not the practice; for these things are written more for reprehension, then imitation. And the minde that comes so instructed, can neuer take harme; for it will take the best, and leaue the worst: But he that reads all things alike, and equally entertaines them in his thought, that Reader shall easily shew himselfe obnoxious to many vices: And it shall happen vnto him, as it did vnto those who imitated Plato's crookednes, or Demosthenes stammering. But when a Reader shall light vpon vnworthy lines, I would haue him cry out as a Philosopher aduiseth on the like occasion; Male hoc, &amp; inconuenienter. But when he meets with good; Rectè hoc &amp; decorè. As the Bee feeds vpon flowers, &amp; the Goat on the tops of herbs; so would I haue him that reades Celestina, graze like a horse on that which is sweet and wholesome grasse; and not like a hungrie dog, which snatches and bites at euery thing that comes in his way. Socrates, when he saw a dishonest woman, would either turne his head aside, or couer his eyes with his cloake; taking whores to bee like coales, which either blacke or burne. Indeede, it was the wisest way for Socrates; for though he were a Philosopher, yet withall he was a wanton: and therefore, for such as cannot looke, but must offend in viewing of the looser Lines, I would haue them imitate the Lightning, which vanisheth, <pb xml:id="ep000328-004-b"/>before it scarce appeares; or your Abortiues, which die, before they be borne. But for as those that are truely honest, and of that perfit temper of goodnes, that nothing can make them decline from the rule of vertue, I would wish them to do with some pieces in this booke (yet to reade all, and where they finde anything vnseemly) as the Priests of old were wont to do, who in their sacrifices vnto Iuno, took forth the garbage of their beasts, and threw it behinde the Altar. If any phrase sauor of immodesty, blame not me, but Celestina. If any Sentence deserue commendation, praise not the Translator, but the Author; for I am no more to be reprehended, or commended, then the poore Parret, who accents but other folkes words, and not his owne. </p>
        <p>If there be any, that is either a Parmeno, or a Sempronio, an Elicia, or an Areusa, a Celestina, or a Centurio, I would haue them to behold themselues in this glasse; not doubting, but that as Narcissus, viewing himselfe in that pure cleare Fountaine, wherein he saw his own most beautifull Image, dyed ouercome with a <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, or selfe-loue; so these men will either die, or their vices in them, through an <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, or hate of themselues; at least make other mens miserable ends, serue as so many sea-markes, that they may not run themselues vpon the like rocks in the sea of this life; wherein all they are miserably drowned, who strike against them. </p>
        <p>But to leaue Celestina to a fauourable censure, I must now come to intreate some fauor for my selfe, who am so farre from pleading my excuse, that I must wholy submit my selfe to your fauourable interpretation; for I must ingeniously confesse, that I haue in the vndergoing of this translation, shewn more boldnesse then iudgement. For though I doe speake like Celestina, yet come I short of her; for she is so concisely significant, and indeede so differing is the Idiome of the Spainish from the English, that I may imitate it, but not come neere it. Yet haue I made it as naturall, as our language will giue leaue, and haue more beaten my braines about it in some places, then a man would beate a Flint to get fire; and, with much adoe, haue forced those <pb xml:id="ep000328-005-a"/>sparkes, which increasing to a greater flame, gaue light to my darke vnderstanding; wherein if I haue been wanting to giue it it's true life, I wish, my industry heerein may awake some better wit, and iudgement to perfect my imperfections, which as I shall alwaies be willing to acknowledge; so I desire to haue them mended by some better hand; nor am I any whit ashamed that any worke of mine should not be absolutely perfect. For it is the Statute and Decree of Heauen, that euery composition heere beneath, as well framed by the hand of Art, as fashioned by the helpe of Nature, should sustaine some imperfection: For Glasse hath it's lead; Gold it's drosse; Corne it's chaffe; Helene her mole; the Moone her spots, and the Sunne its shade. My expression is but like a picture drawne with a coale, wanting those liuely colours, which others more skilfull might giue it; and might better it as much, if they would vndergo the paines; as bad faces are bettered by painting, and vnsauory meates mended by their sauces. But I am too saucie in my desire; howsoeuer, I will notwithstanding shew my selfe a good Christian; that though my workes doe not merit any reward, yet my faith and assurance is such in you, that I make no question, but my workes shall be well accepted by you. In requitall whereof, I will euer loue you, and rest </p>

        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <p>IT is the saying of that great and wise Philosopher Heraclitus; That all things are created in manner of a contention, or battell. His words are these, Omnia secundùm litem fiunt. A Sentence in my opinion, worthy perpetuall memorie; and, for that most certaine it is, that euery word of a wise man, is pregnant, and full; of this it may be said, that through too much fulnesse it is readie to burst, shooting forth such spreading, and well-growne boughs and leaues, that out of the smallest Sucker, or least Sprig thereof, fruit enough may be gathered by men of discretion and iudgement. But because my poore vnderstanding is not able to doe anymore, then to nibble on the drie bark and rugged rinde of the wise sayings of those, who for the clearnesse and excellencie of their wits, deserued to be approued; with that little which I shall plucke from thence, I will satisfie the intent and purpose of this short Prologue. This Sentence did I finde to be strengthened by that great Orator, and Poet Lauriat Francisco Petrarca, who tells vs, Sine lite atque offensione nihil genuit natura parens: That Nature, who is the mother of all things, ingendred nothing without strife and contention. Furthermore saying, Sic est enim, &amp; sic propemodun vniuersa testantur; Rapido stellae obuiant firmamento; Contraria inuicem Elementa confligunt; Terrae tremunt; Maria fluctuant; Aër quati tur; Crepant flammae; Bellum immortale venti gerunt; Tempora temporibus concertant; secum, singula; Nobiscum omnia. Which is as much to say; Indeede so it is, and so all things almost in the world doe witnesse as much. The Starres incounter one another in the whirling firmament of heauen; your contrarie Elements wage warre each with other; the earth, that <pb xml:id="ep000328-006-a"/>trembles and quakes, as if it were at oddes with it selfe; the Sea, that swels and rages, breaking it's billowes one against another; the Ayre, that darteth arrowes of lightning, and is moued this way and that way; the flames, they cracke, and sparkle forth their furie; the windes are at perpetuall enmitie with themselues; times with times doe contend; one thing against another, and all against vs. We see, that the Summer makes vs complaine of too much heate; and the Winter, of cold and sharpenesse of weather. So that this, which seemeth vnto vs a temporall reuolution; this, by which we are bred vp, and nourished, and liue, if it once beginne to passe aboue it's proportion, and to grow to a greater highth then vsuall, it is no better then open warre. And how much it ought to bee feared, is manifested by those great earth-quakes and whirlewinds, by those ship-wrackes and fires, as well in the ayre, as the earth; by the sourse of water-courses, and violence of inundations, by those courses, and recourses, those rackings to and fro of the Clouds, of whose open motions, to know the secret cause from whence they proceed, no lesse is the dissention of the Philosophers in the schooles, then of the waues of the Sea. Besides, among your bruit beasts, there is not any one of them that wants his warre; be they Fishes, Birds, Beasts, or Serpents; whereof, euery kinde persecuteth, and pursueth one another: The Lyon, hee pursues the Wolfe; the Wolfe the Kidde; the Dog the Hare. And if it might not be thought a fable, or old wifes tale, sitting by the fire side, I should more fully inlarge this Theame. The Elephant, that is so powerfull and strong a beast, is afraide, and flies from the sight of a poore silly Mouse; and no sooner heares him comming, but hee quakes and trembles for feare. Amongst Serpents, Nature created the Basiliske, so venomous and poysonfull, and gaue him such a predominant power ouer all the rest, that onely with his hissing, he doth affright them; with his comming, put them to flight, and disperseth some one way, some another, and with his sight, kills and murders them. The Viper, a crawling creature, and venomous Serpent, at the time of ingendring, the Male puts his head into the mouth of the Female, and shee through the great delight, and sweetnesse of her pleasure, straines him so hard, that she kills him. And conceiuing her young, the eldest, or first of her brood, breakes the <pb xml:id="ep000328-006-b"/>barres of his mothers belly, eates out his way thorow her bowels, at which place all the rest issue forth; whereof she dies; hee doing this, as a reuenger of his fathers death. What greater conflict, what greater contention or warre can there be, then to conceiue that in her body, which shall eate out her Intralls? Againe, no lesse naturall dissention can we suppose to be amongst fishes; for most certaine it is, that the Sea doth containe as many seuerall sorts of fishes, as the earth and ayre do nourish bords and beasts; and much more. Aristotle and Pliny doe recount wonders of a little fish called Aecheneis; how apt his nature is, and how prone his propertie for diuers kindes of contentions, especially this one; that if hee cling to a shiper Carrack, he will detaine and stop her in her course, though she haue the winde in the poope of her, and cut the Seas with neuer so stiffe a gale. Whereof Lucan maketh mention, saying, </p>

        <p>O naturall contention! worthy of admiration, that a little fish should be able to doe more then a great ship, with all the force and strength of the winds. Moreouer, if we will discourse of birds, and of their frequent enmities, we may truly affirm, that all things are created in a kind of contention. Your greater liue of rapine, as Eagles and Hawks; and your crauen Kites presse vpon our Pullen, insulting ouer them euen in our own houses, and offring to take them euen from vnder the Hens wings. Of a bird called Roque, which is bred in the East Indian Sea, it is said to be of an incredible greatnesse, that the like hath neuer bin heard of; and that with her beake, she will hoyse vp into the ayre, not only one man, or ten, but a whole ship laden with men and merchandise; and how that these miserable passengers, hanging thus in suspence in the ayre, till her wings waxe weary, she lets them fall, and so they receiue their deaths. But what shall we say of men, to whom all the foresaid creatures are subiect? Who can expresse their wars, their iars, their enmities, their enuies, their heats, their broyles, their brawles, and their discontentments? That change and alteration of fashions in their apparell? That pulling downe and building vp of houses? and many other sundry effects <pb xml:id="ep000328-007-a"/>and varieties; all of them proceeding from the feeble and weake condition of mans variable nature? And because it is an old and ancient complaint, and vsed heretofore time out of minde; I will not much maruell, if this present worke shall proue an instrument of war to its Readers, putting strifes and differences amongst them, euery one giuing his verdict and opinion thereupon, according to the humour of his owne will. Some perhaps may say that it is too long; some too short; others to be sweet and pleasant; and other some to be darke and obscure: So that to cut it out to the measure of so many, and such different dispositions, is onely appropriate to God; Especially, since that it, together with all other things, whatsoeuer are in this world, march vnder the standard of this noble Sentence; For euen the very life of men, if we consider them from their first and tendeer age, till they grow gray-headed, is nothing else but a battell. Children with their sports, boyes with their bookes, young men with their pleasures, old men with a thousand sorts of infirmities, skirmish and warre continually: and these Papers, with all ages. The first blots and teares them; the second knowes not well how to read them; the third (which is the cheerefull liuelihood of youth, and set all vpon iollity) doth vtterly dislike of them. Some gnaw onely the bones, but do not picke out the marrow, saying there is no goodnesse in it; that it is a History, huddled, I know not how, together, a kind of hodgepode, or gallimaufrey; not profiting themselues out of the particularities, accounting it a fable, or old wifes tale, fitting for nothing, saue only for to passe away the time vpon the way. Others call out the witty conceits, and common prouerbs, highly commending them, but slighting and neglecting that which makes more to the purpose, and their profit. But they for whose true pleasure it is wholy framed, reiect the story it selfe, as a vayne and idle subiect, and gather out the pith and marrow of the matter for their owne good and benefit, and laugh at those things that sauour onely of wit, and pleasant conceite, storing vp in their memorie, the sentences and sayings of Philosophers, that they may transpose them into such fit places, as may make, vpon occasion, for their owne vse and purpose. So that when ten men shall meete together to heare this Comedy, in whom perhaps shall happen this difference of dispositions, as it vsually falleth out; who will deny, but that there is a contention in that <pb xml:id="ep000328-007-b"/>thing which is so diuersly vnderstood? the Printers, they likewise haue bestowed their puncture, putting Titles, and adding Arguments to the beginning of euery Act; deliuering in briefe, what is more largely contained therein; a thing very excusable, in former times being much vsed, and in great request with your ancient Writers; others haue contended about the name, saying, that it ought not to be called a Comedy, because it ends in sorrow and mourning, but rather termed a Tragedy. The Authour himselfe would haue it take it's denomination from it's beginning, which treates of pleasure, and therfore call'd it a Comedy. So that I seeing these differences, between their extremes haue parted this quarrell, by diuiding it in the midst, and call it a Tragick-Comedy. So that obseruing these contentions, these disagreements, these dissonant and various iudgements, I had an eye, to marke whither the maior part inclined, and found that they were all desirous, that I should inlarge my selfe in the pursuite of the delight of these Louers; whereunto, I haue been earnestly importuned; in so much, that I haue consented (though against my will) to put now the second time my Penne to this so strange a taske, and so farre estranged from my faculty, stealing some houres from my principall studies, together with others allotted to my recreation, though I know, I shall not want new Detractors for my new Edition. </p>

Whose chaste purpose conquered by the hot pursuite of amorous Calisto, Celestine interposing her selfe in the businesse, a wicked and crafty woman, and together with her two deluded seruants of subdued Calisto, and by her wrought to be disloiall, their fidelitie being taken with the hooke of couetousnesse and pleasure; Those Louers came, and those that serued them, to a wretched and vnfortunate end.

            <p>With me Sir? there is no reason that he should goe with me, who stayes with you. O vnfortunate, O sudden and vnexpected ill; what contrarious accident, what squint-ey'd starre is it that hath robbed this Gentleman of his wonted mirth? and not of that alone, but of it (which is worse) his wits. Shall I leaue him all alone? or shall I goe in to him? If I leaue him alone, he will kill himselfe. If I goe in, he will kill me. Let him bide alone, and bite vpon the bit, come what will, come I care not. Better it is that hee dye, whose life is hatefull vnto him, then that I dye, when life is pleasing vnto mee, and say that I should not desire to liue, saue onely to see my Elicia, that alone is motiue inough to make mee looke to my <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000328-010-a"/>selfe, and guard my person from dangers: but admit he should kill himselfe without any other witnesse, then must I be bound to giue account of his life. Well, I will in for that, but put case when I come in, he will take neither comfort nor counsell: mary his case is desperate, for it is a shrewd signe of death, not to be willing to be cured. Well, I will let him alone a while, and giue his humour leaue to worke out it selfe; I will forbeare, till his angry fit be ouer-past, and that his hat be come againe to his colour. For I haue heard say, that it is dangerous to lance or crush an Impostume before it bee ripe, for then it will 〈◊〉 the more: Let him alone a while, let vs suffer him to weepe who suffers to sorrow, for teares and sighes doe ease the heart that is surcharded with griefe; but then againe, if he see mee in sight, I shall see him more incensed against mee: For there the sunne scorcheth most, where he reflecteth most: the sight which hath no obiect set before it, waxeth weary-and dull, and hauing its obiect, is as quicke. And therefore I thinke it my best play, to play least in sight, and to stay a little longer; but if in the meane while he should kill himselfe, then farewell he. Perhaps I may get more by it then euery man is aware of, and cast my skinne, changing rags for robes, and penury for plenty: But it is an old saying, He that lookes after dead-mens shooes, may chance to goe barefoote: Perhaps also the diuell hath deceiued me. And so his death may be my death, and then all the fat is in the fire: The rope will go after the Bucket: and one losse follow another; on the otherside, your wise men say, That it is a great ease to a grieued soule, or one that is afflicted, to haue a companion, to whom he may communicate his sorrow. Besides, it is generally receiued, that the wound which bleedes inward, is euer the more dangerous. Why then in these two extremes hang I in suspence what I were best to doe? Sure, the safest is to enter: and better it is that I should indure his anger, then for feare of his displeasure to forbeare to comfort him. For, if it be possible to cure without Arte, and without things ready at hand, farre easier is it to cure by Arte, and wanting nothing that is necessary. </p>

For, without these outward goods, wherof fortune is chiefe Mistresse, no man in this life comes to be happy. Lastly, the starres were so propitious at thy birth, and thy selfe borne vnder so good a Planet, that thou are belou'd of all. </p>

And in all that, wherein thou dost so glorifie my gifts, I tell shee (Sempronio) compared with Melibea's, they are but as starres to the Sunne; or drosse compared to gold. Doe but consider the noblenesse of her blod, the ancientnesse of her house, the great estate she is borne vnto, the excellency of her wit, the splendour of her vertues, her stately, yet comely carriage, her ineffable gracefulnesse in all that shee doth; and lastly, her diuine beauty; whereof (I pray thee) giue mee leaue to discourse a little, for the refreshing of my soule.

            <speaker>Parme. </speaker>
            <p>I went into the market place, and fetch't her vitailes; I waited on her in the streetes, and supplyed her wants in other the like seruices, as farre as my poore sufficiency, and slender strength was able to performe. So that though I continued but a little while with her, yet I remember euery thing as fresh, as if it were but yesterday, in so much that old-age hath not been able to weare it out. This good honest whore, this graue matrone, forsooth, had at the very end of the Citty, there where your Tanners dwell, close by the waterside, a lone house, somewhat far from neighbours, halfe of it fallen downe, ill contriued, and worse furnished. Now, for to get her liuing, yee must vnderstand, shee had sixe seuerall Trades: shee was a Laundresse, a Perfumeresse, a Former of faces, a Mender of crackt maiden-heads, a Bawd, and had some smatch of a Witch; Her first Trade was a cloak to all the test; vnder color wherof, being withall a piece of a Sempstresse, many young wenches that were of <pb n="16" xml:id="ep000328-016-a"/>your ordinary sorts of seruants, came to her house to worke: some on smockes, some on gorgets and many other things: but not one of them that came thither, but brought with her either bacon, wheate, flower, or a Iar of wine, or some other the like prouision, which they could conueniently steale from their Mistresses, and some other thefts of greater quality, making her house (for shee was the receiuer, and kept all things close) the Rendeuous of all their Roguery: she was a great friend to your Students, Noble mens Caterers, and Pages: To these shee sold that innocent blood of these poore miserable soules, who did easily aduenture their virginities, drawne on by faire promises, and the restitution and reparation which she would make them of their lost maiden-heads. Nay, shee proceeded so far, that by cunning meanes, she had accesse and communication with your very Vestalls, and neuer left them, till shee had brought her purpose to passe. And what time do you think she chose when she would deale with any of these? At the time of their chiefest ceremonies; as when they kept their most mysterious celebration of the feasts of their Vesta, nay, and that most strictly solemnized day of Bona Dea, where it is death to admit men: euen then by vnheard of disguises, she had her plots and proiects effectually working vpon them, to the vtter abolition of their vowes and virginity. Now, what thinke you, were the trades and marchandise wherein she dealt? She professed her selfe a kinde of Phisician, and fained that shee had good skill in curing of little children: Shee would goe and fetch flaxe from one house, and put it forth to spinning to another, that she might thereby haue pretence for the freer accesse vnto all: One would cry, Here mother: and another, There mother: Look, saies the third, where the old woman comes: Yonder comes that Bel-dame so well knowne to all. Yet notwithstanding all these her cares, troubles, and trottings to and fro, being neuer out of action, she would neuer misse any great meeting, any religious processions, any Nuptials, Loue-ties, Balls, maskes or games whatsoeuer; They were the onely markets, where she made all her bargaines. And at home in her owne house shee made perfumes, false and counterfait Storax, Beniamin, Gumme, Anime, Amber, Ciuit, Powders, Muske and Mosqueta: Shee had a chamber full of Limbecks, little vialls, pots, some of earth, some of glasse, some brasse, and some tinne, formed in a thousand fashions. Shee made sublimated Mercury, boyled confections for to clarifie the skinne, waters to make the face glister, paintings, some white, some vermillion, lip-salues, scarlet-dy'd cloathes, fitted purposely for women to rub their faces therewith, oyntments for to make the face smooth, lustrifications, clarifications, pargetings, fardings, waters for the morphewes, and a thousand other slibber slabbers: Some made of the lees of wine, some of daffadills, some of the barkes and rindes of trees, some of Scar-wolfe, otherwise called Cittibush, or Trifolium, some of Taragon, some of Centory, some of sowre <pb n="17" xml:id="ep000328-016-b"/>grapes, some of Must, or new wine taken from the presse, first distilled, and afterwards sweetned with sugar. Shee had a tricke to supple and refine the skin with the juice of Lemmons, with Turpentine, with the marrow of Deere, and of Heron-shawes, and a thousand the like confections: shee distilled sweet-waters, of Roses, of Flowers, of Oranges, of Iesmine, of three-leafed Grasse, of Woodbine, of Gilly-flowers, incorporated with Muske and Ciuit, and sprinkled with wine: shee made likewise Lees, for to make the 〈◊〉 turne yellow, or of the colour of Gold; and this shee comp●●d of the sprigs of the Vine, of Holme, of Rye, of Horehound intermixt with Salt-peter, with Allum, Mill-foyle, which some call yarrow, or Nose-bleed, together with diuers other things. The oyles, the butters, and the greases which shee vsed, it is lothsome to tell you, and would turne your stomacke: as of Kine, Beares, Horses, Ca●●e●s, Snakes, Conyes, Whales, Herons, Bittours, Bucks, Cats of the mountaines, Badgers, Squirrells, Hedge-hogges and others. For her preparatiues for bathings, it is a wonderfull thing to acquaint you with all the hearbes and rootes which were ready gathered and hung vp a-high in the roofe of her house: as Ca●romill, Rose-mary, Marth-mallowes, Maiden-haire, Blue-bottle, Flowers of Elder, and of Mustard, Spike and white Laurell, buds of Roses, Rosecakes, Gramenilla, Wild-Sauory, Green figs, Picodorae, and Folia-tinct. The oyles which she extracted for the face, it is incredible to recount, of Storax and of Iesmine, of Lemmons, of Apple-kernels, of Violets, of Ben●uy, of Fistick-nuts, of Pine-apple kernels, of Grape-stores, of Iujuba, of Axenuz or M●lanthien, of Lupines, of Pease, of Carilla, and Paxarera; and a small quantity of Balsamum she had in a little viall, wherwith she cured that scotch giuen her ouerthwart her nose. For the mending of lost maiden-heads, some shee holpe with little bladders, and other some she stitch't vp with the needle: shee had in a little Cabbinet, or painted workeboxe, certain fine small needles, such as your Glouers sowe withall, and threds of the slenderest &amp; smallest silke, rubb'd ouer with wax: she had also roots hanging there of Folia-Plasme, Fuste-sanguinio, Squill or Sea-Onion, and ground Thistle. With these she did work wonders; and when the French Embassadour came thither, shee made sale of one of her wenches, three seuerall times for a virgin. </p>

            <p>Beleeue mee (Sir) it is true as I tell you. Besides, out of charity forsooth, she relieued many Orphanes, and many straggling wenches, which recommended themselues vnto her. In another partition, she had her knacks for to help those that were loue-sicke, and to make them to be beloued againe, and obtaine their desires. And for this purpose, shee had the bones that are bred in a Stagges heart, the tongue of a Viper, the heads of Quailes the braines of an Asse, the kalls of young Coltes, when they are new foaled, the bearing cloth of a new-borne babe, Barbary beanes, a Sey-Compasse, <pb n="18" xml:id="ep000328-017-a"/>A Horne-fish, the halter of a man that hath beene hang'd, Iuse berries, the prickles of a Hedge-hogge, the foote of a Badger, Fearne-seed, the stone of an Eagles nest, and a thousand other things. Many both men and women came vnto her: of some she would demand a piece of that bread where they had bit it: of others, some part of their apparell: of some, shee would craue to haue of their hayre: others, she would draw characters in the palmes of their hands with Saffrom; with othersome she would doe the same with a kinde of colour, which you call Vermilion: to others she would giue hearts made of waxe, and stucke full of broken needles; and many other the like things, made in clay, and some in lead, very fearefull, and ghastly to behold: shee would draw circles, portraite foorth figures, and mumble many strange words to her selfe, hauing her eyes still fixed on the ground. But who is able to deliuer vnto you those things that she hath done? And all these were meere mockeries and lyes. </p>

            <p>A pocks on you for a rogue. Our (impudent!) art thou not ashamed to talke thus? But to leaue off all jesting, and to come to plaine earnest; Heare me now (my childe) and hearken what I shall say vnto thee. For, though I am called hither for one end, I am come for another. And albeit I haue made my selfe a stranger vnto thee, and as though I knew thee not, yet thou wast the onely cause that drew mee hither. My sonne, I am sure thou art not ignorant, how that your mother gaue you vnto me, your father being then aliue; who, after thou wentst from <pb n="24" xml:id="ep000328-020-a"/>me, dyed of no other griefe, saue onely what she suffered for the vncertainty of thy life and person. For whose absence in those latter yeeres of her elder age, she led a most painefull, pensiue and carefull life. And when the time came, that she was to leaue this world, shee sent for mee, and in secret recommended thee vnto me, and told me, (no other witnesse being by, but heauen the witnesse to 〈◊〉 our workes, our thoughts, our hearts, whom she alone interpose betweene her and mee) that of all loues I should doe so much 〈◊〉, as to make inquirie after thee, and when I had found thee, 〈◊〉 thee vp, &amp; foster thee as mine own: and that as soon as thou 〈◊〉 come to mans estate, &amp; wert able to know how to gouern thy selfe, and to liue in some good manner and fashion; that then I should discouer vnto thee a certain place, where, vnder many a lock and key, she hath left thee more store of Gold and Siluer, then all the reuenewes come to, that thy Master Calisto hath in his possession. And because I solemnly vow'd, and bound my selfe by promise vnto her, that I would see her desire, as far foorth as lay in me, to be well and truely performed, she peacefully departed this mortall life; and though a mans faith ought to be inuiolably obserued both to the liuing and the dead, yet more especially to the dead; for they are not able to doe any thing of themselues, they cannot come to me, and prosecute their right here vpon earth. I haue spent much time &amp; mony in inquiring &amp; searching after thee, &amp; could neuer till now heare what was become of thee: and it is not aboue three daies since, that I first heard of your being, and where you abode. Verily, it hath much grieued me, that thou hast gon trauelling, &amp; wandring throughout the world, as thou hast done from place, to place, losing thy time, without either gaine of profit, or of friends. For, (as Seneca saith) Trauellers haue many ends, and few friends. For, in so short a time they can neuer fasten friendship with any: and hee that is euery where, is said to be no where. Againe, that meat cannot benefit the body, which is no sooner eaten, then eiected. Neither doth any thing more hinder it's health, then your diuersities, and changes of meates. Nor doth that would come to be healed, which hath daily change of tents, and neuer plasters. Nor doth that Tree neuer proue, which is often transplanted and remoued from one ground to another. Nor is there any thing to profitable, which at the first sight bringeth profit with it▪ Therefore (my good sonne) leaue off these violencies of youth, and following the doctrine, and rule of thy Ancestors, returne vnto reason, settle thy selfe in some one place or other. And where better, then where I shal aduise thee, taking mee, and my counsell along with thee, to whom thou art recommended both by thy father and mother? And I, as if I were thine owne true mother, say vnto thee, vpon those curses and maledictions, which thy parents haue laid vpon thee, if thou should'st be disobedient vnto me, that yet a while thou continue heere, and serue this thy Master which thou hast gotten thee, till thou hearest <pb n="25" xml:id="ep000328-020-b"/>further from mee, but not with that foolish loyalty, and ignorant honesty, as hitherto thou hast done; thinking to finde firmenesse vpon a false foundation, as most of these Masters now a daies are. But doe thou gaine friends, which is a durable and lasting commodity; sticke closely and constantly vnto them; doe not thou liue vpon hopes, relying on the vaine promises of Masters, who sucke away the substance of their seruants, with hollow-hearted, and idle promises, as the horse-leaches suck bloud; and in the end fall off from them, wrong them, grow forgetfull of their good seruices, and deny them any recompence or reward at all. Wo be vnto him that growes old in Court. The Masters of these times loue more themselues then their seruants; neither in so doing doe they doe amisse. The like loue ought seruants to beare vnto themselues. Liberality was lost long agoe; rewards are growne out of date; magnificence is fled the countrie; and with her, all noblenesse. Euery one of them is wholly now for himselfe, and makes the best hee can of his seruants seruice, seruing his turne, as hee findes it may stand with his priuate interest and profit. And therefore they ought to doe no lesse, sithens that they are lesse then they in substance, but to liue after their law, and to doe as they doe. My sonne Parmeno, I the rather tell thee this, because thy Master (as I am informed) is (as it seemeth▪ likewise vnto mee) a Rompenecios, one that befooles his seruants, and weares them out to the very stumps, lookes for much seruice at their hands, and makes them small, or no recompence: He will looke to be serued of all, but will part with nothing at all. Weigh well my words, and perswade thy selfe, that what I haue said is true: Get thee some friends in his house, which is the greatest, and preciousest Iewell in the world. For, with him thou must not thinke to fasten friendship. A thing seldome seene, where there is such difference of estate and condition, as is betweene you two. Opportunity, thou seest, now offers her selfe vnto vs, on whose fore-top, if wee will but take hold, wee shall all of vs be great gainers, and thou shalt presently haue something, wherewithall to help thy selfe. As for that which I told you of, it shall bee well and safely kept, when time shall serue; in the meane while, it shall be much for thy profit, that thou make Sempronio thy friend. </p>

And where canst thou get a fitter, neerer, and better companion in this kinde, then where those three kinde of friendships doe concurre in one? To wit, goodnesse, profit, and pleasure.

And delight is with friends, in things that are sensuall; but especially in recounting matters of loue, and communicating them, the one to the other. This did I do my selfe; this such a one told me; such a iest did wee breake; in this sort did I winne her; thus often did I kisse her: thus often did shee bite me; thus I imbraced her; thus came wee neerer and neerer.

            <p>My mother (I see) is angry; and what I were best to do, I know not. I am doubtfull of following her councell: it is as great an errour to beleeue nothing, as it is to beleeue euery thing. The more humane and ciuill course is, to haue affiance and confidence in her. Especially in that, where besides the present benefit, both profit and pleasure is proposed. I haue heard tell; that a man should beleeue his betters, and those whose yeers carry authority with them. Now; What is it she aduiseth me vnto? To be at peace with Sempronio: and to peace, no man ought to be opposite. For blessed are the peacefull. Loue and charity towards our brethren, that is not to be shunned and auoided by vs; and few are they, that will forgoe their profit. I will therefore seeke to please her, and hearken vnto her. Mother, a master ought not be offended with his Schollers ignorance; at least, very seldome in matters of depth and knowledge. For though knowledge in its owne nature, be communicable vnto all, yet is it infused but into few. And therefore I pray pardon me, and speake a new vnto me; For, I will not only heare and beleeue thee, but receiue thy councell as a singular kindnesse, and a token of thy great fauour, and especiall loue towards mee. Nor yet would I, that you should thanke mee for this; Because the praise and thankes of euery action, ought rather to be attributed <pb n="29" xml:id="ep000328-022-b"/>to the giuer then to the receiuer. Command mee therefore; for to your commandements shall I euer be willing, that my consent submit it selfe. </p>

            <p>It is proper to a man to erre; but to a beast, to perseuere in an errour. It doth much glad me, Parmeno, that thou hast clear'd thosee thicke clouds, which darkened thy eye-sight, and hast answered mee according to the wisedome, discretion, and sharpe wit of thy father, whose person, now representing it selfe fresh to my remembrance, doth make my tender eyes to melt into teares, which thou seest in such abundance to trickle downe my cheeks. He sometimes would maintaine hard and strange propositions, but would presently (such was the goodnesse of his nature) see his errour, and imbrace the truth▪ I sweare vnto thee; that in thus seeing thee to thwart the truth, and then suddenly vpon it, laying down all contradiction, and to be conformable to that which was reason; me thinks, I doe as liuely now behold thy father: as if he now were liuing, and present heere before mee. O what a man he was, how proper in his person, how able in his actions, what a part did he beare, and what a venerall and reuerend countenance did hee carry! But hush, I heare Calisto comming, and thy new friend, Sempronio, whose reconcilement with him, I referre to some fitter opportunity. For, two liuing in one heart, are more powerfull both for action, and vnderstanding. </p>

            <p>Yes Sir, exceeding well. For, besides, the sauing of your life, you haue gained much honour by it. And for what end is fortune fauourable and prosperous, but to be a handmaide to our honour, and to wayte thereon, which of all worldly goods is the greatest? For honor is the reward and recompence of vertue; and for this cause wee giue it vnto the Diuine Essence, because wee haue not any thing greater to giue him. The best part whereof consisteth in liberality and bounty: and this close-fistednes, and vncommunicated treasure, doth eclypse and darken, whereas magnificence and liberality doth gaine, and highly extoll it. What good is it for a man to keep that to himselfe, which in the keeping of it, does himselfe no good? I tell you, Sir, and what I speake is truth; Better is the vse of riches, then the possessing of them. O, how glorious a thing is it to giue? and how miserable to <pb n="31" xml:id="ep000328-023-b"/>receiue? See, how much better action is then passion: so much more noble is the giuer, then the receiuer. Amongst the Elements, the fire, because it is more actiue, is the more noble: and therefore placed in the Spheares, in the noblest place. And some say; that noblenesse is a praise proceeding from the merit, and antiquity of our Ancesters. But I am of opinion, that another mans light can neuer make you shine, vnlesse you haue some of your owne. And therefore doe not glory in the noblenesse of your father, who was so magnificent a Gentleman, but in your owne. Shine not out of his, but your owne light; and so shall you get your selfe honour, which is mans greatest outward good. Wherefore not the bad, but the good, (such as your selfe) are worthy to partake of so perfect a vertue. And besides, I must tell you, that perfect vertue doth not suppose that Honour hath it's fellow: and therefore reioce with your selfe, that you haue beene so magnificent, and so bountifull. And thus, Sir, hauing told you my minde, let mee now aduise you that you would be pleased to returne backe to your chamber, and there take some rest, sithence, that your businesse is deposited in such hands; assuring your selfe, that the beginning being so good, the end will be much better: and so let vs goe presently to your chamber; where I shall treate more at large with you concerning this businesse. </p>

            <p>Me thinkes (Sempronio) it is no good counsell, that I shouldest heere accompanied, and that shee should goe all alone, who seekes to cure my ill: it were better that thou shouldst goe along with her, and hasten her on, since thou knowst, that on her dililigence dependeth my well-fare; on her slownesse, my painfulnesse, on her neglect, my despaire. Thou art wise, I know thee to bee faithfull, I hold thee a good seruant. And therefore so handle the matter, that she shall no sooner see thee, but that shee may iudge of that paine which I feele, and of that fire which tormenteth mee; whose extreme heat will not giue me leaue to lay open vnto her the third part of my secret sickenesse. So did it tye my tongue, and tooke such hold on my sences, that they were not onely busied, but in a manner wasted and consumed; which thou, as one that is free from the like passion, maist more largely deliuer, letting thy words runne with a looser reyne. </p>

But I will obey and follow your councell; which is, to goe and labour the old woman. But how shall I goe? For, if I leaue you thus all alone, you will talke idlely, like one that is distracted; doe nothing but sigh, weepe, and take on, shutting your selfe vp in darknesse, desiring solitude, and seeking new meanes of thoughtfull torment; wherein if you still perseuere, you cannot escape either death or madnesse. For the auoyding whereof, get some good company <pb n="32" xml:id="ep000328-024-a"/>about you, that may minister vnto you occasion of mirth, by recounting of witty conceits, by intertaining you with Musicke, and singing merry songs, by relating Stories, by deuising Motto's, by telling tales, by playing at cards, iesting, sporting.

And that Macias, the Idoll of Louers, forgetfull of himselfe, because his mistresse did forget him; and carelesse of his well fare, because she cared not for him, complaines himselfe thus: That the punishment of loue consists in the contemplation thereof: And that the best remedy against loue, is, not to thinke on thy loue. The ease lies in the forgetting it. Kick not therefore against the pricke, feyne thy selfe to be merry, pluck vp your spirits and be of good cheere, and all, you shall see, shall be well: for oftentimes, opinion brings things whither it listeth: Not that it should cause vs to swarue from the truth; but for to teach vs to moderate our sence, and to gouerne our iudgement. </p>

And there is no wound so painefull, which in time doth not slacken much of it's torment. Nor was there euer any pleasure so delightfull, which hath not by long continuance beene much diminished and lessened. Ill and good, prosperity and aduersity, glory and griefe; all these with time lose the force and strength of their rash and hasty beginning; Whereas matters of admiration, and things earnestly desired, once obtained, haue no sooner beene come, then forgotten, no sooner purchased, but relinquished. Euery day we see new and strange accidents, wee heare as many, and wee passe them ouer; leaue those, and hearken after others; them also doth time lessen &amp; make contingible, as things of common course. And I pray, what wonder would you thinke it, if some should come and tell you; There was such an earth-quake in such a place, or some such other things; tell me, would you not streight forget it? As also, if one should say vnto you, Such a Riuer is frozen, such a blinde man hath recouered his sight; thy father is dead; such a thunder bolt fell in such a place; Granada is taken; the King enters it this day; the Turke hath receiu'd an ouer-throw; to morrow you shall haue a great Eclypse; such a bridge is carried away with the flood; such a one is now made a Noble man; Peter is rob'd; Annes hath hang'd her selfe.

Wee did both eate, both sleep, both inioy our pleasures, our counsels, &amp; our bargaines, 〈◊〉 one with another; we liued together like two sisters both at home and abroad: there was not a farthing which eyther of vs gained, but was faithfully and truly diuided betweene vs. Had shee liued, I should neuer haue liued to be deceiued. But it was not my fortune to be so happy, shee dy'd too soone for mee. O death, death, how many doest thou depriue of their sweete and pleasing society! How many doest thou discomfort with thy vnwelcome and troublesome Visitation? For one that thou eatest being ripe, thou croppest a thousand that are greene; For were shee aliue, these my steps should not haue beene vnaccompanied, not driuen (as now I am) to walke the streets alone. I haue good cause to remember her; for to me shee was a faithfull friend, and a good companion. And whilest shee was with me; she would neuer suffer mee to trouble my body, or my braines about any thing: if I brought bread, shee would bring meate; if I did spread the cloth, she would lay the napkins: she was not foolish, nor fantasticall, nor proud, as most of your women now adaies are. And by my say, I sweare vnto thee, shee would goe barefaced from one end of the City to the other, with her Fan in her hand, and not one, all the way that she went, would giue her any worse word, then Mistresse Claudina. And I dare be bold to say it, that there was not a woman of a better palate for wine in the world, nor better skill'd in any kind of marchandize whatsoeuer. And when you haue thought that she had been scarce out of doores, with a whip-Sir Iohn, e'r you could scarce say this, shee was heere againe. Euery one would inuite and feast her, so great was the affection which they bare vnto her; And she neuer came home, till she had taken a taste of some eight or ten sorts of wine, bearing one pottle in her Iar, and the other in her belly: and her credit was so good, that they would haue trusted her for a Rundlet or two vpon her bare word, as if shee had pawned vnto them a piece of plate. Why, her word was as currant as gold, in all the Innes and Tauernes in the Towne. If wee walked the streetes, whensoeuer we found our selues thirsty, we entred streight the next Tauerne that was at hand, and called presently for a quart of wine for to moysten our mouthes withall, though we had not a penny to pay for it. Nor would they (as from others) take our vailes and our coyfes from off our heads, till we had discharged the reckoning, but score it vp, and so let vs go on our way. O Sempronio; Were it but <pb n="40" xml:id="ep000328-028-a"/>Cat after kind, and that such were the son, as was the mother, assure thy selfe that thy master should remaine without a feather, and we without any farther care.

            <p>There is not that Surgeon, that can at the first dressing, giue a true iudgement of his Patients wound: but what I see, and thinke for the present, I will plainely deliuer vnto thee. Melibea is faire; Calisto fond and frank; he cares not to spare his purse, nor I my paines; hee is willing to spend, and I to speed him in his businesse; Let his money be stirring, and let the suite hang as long as it will. Money can doe any thing; it splitteth hard Rocks; it passeth ouer Riuers dry-foote; there is not any place so high, whereunto an Asse laden with gold will not get vp; his vnaduisednesse, and feruentnesse of affection, is sufficient to marre him, and to make vs. This I haue thought vpon; this I haue searcht into; this is all I know concerning him and her: and this is that which must make most for our profit. Well, now must I goe to Pleberio's house. Sempronio, fare-well. For though Melibea braue it, and stands so high vpon her pantofles; yet is not shee the first that I haue made to stoope, and leaue her cackling; they are all of them ticklish, and skittish; the whole generation of them is giuen to winching &amp; flinging: but after they are well weyghed, they prooue good high-way Iades, and trauell quietly; you may kill them, but neuer tyre them. If they iourney by night, they wish it may neuer be morning. They curse the Cockes, because they proclaime it is day: the Clockes, because they go too fast: they lye prostrate, as if they lookt after the Pleyades and the North star, making themselues Astronomers, and starre gazers; But when they see the morning starre arise, they sigh for sorrow, and are ready to forsake their bodies. And the clearing of the day, is the clouding of their ioy. And aboue all, it is worth the while, to note how quickely they change copy, and turne the Cat in the pan; They intreat him, of whom they were intreated; they indure torment for him, whom before they had tormented; they are seruants to those, whose Mistresses they were; they breake thorow stone walls, they open windowes, feyne sicknesse; if the hinges of their doores chance to creake, they anoynt and supple them <pb n="41" xml:id="ep000328-028-b"/>with oyle, that they may performe their office without any noyse. I am not able to expresse vnto thee the great impression of that sweetnesse, which the primary and first kisses of him they loue, leaueth imprinted in their hearts. They are enemies of the meane, and wholly set vpon extremes. </p>

            <p>Marry, I say, that a woman either loueth, or hateth him much, of whom she is beloued, so that, if she entertaine not his loue, she cannot dissemble her hate; there are no reynes strong inough to bridle their dislike. And because I know this to be true, it makes mee goe more merrily and cheerefully to Melibea's house, then if I had her fast in my fist already. For I know, that though at the first I must be forced to woo her, yet in the end, she will be glad to sue to me. And though at present perhaps she threaten me, and flatly fall out with mee; yet at last will shee be well pleased, and fall as much a flattering, as she did a reuiling me. Here in this pocket of mine, I carry a little parcel of yarne, and other such like trinkets, which I alwaies beare about mee; that I may haue some pretence at first to make my easier entrance and free accesse, where I am not throughly knowne: As Gorgets, Coyfes, Fringes, Rowles, Fillets, Hayre-laces, Nippers, Antimony, Ceruse, and sublimated Mercury, Needles and Pinnes; they shall not aske that thing, which I shall not haue for them. To the end, that looke whatsoeuer they shall call for, I may be ready prouided for them. And this baite vpon the first sight thereof shall worke my acceptance, and hold fast the fish which I minde to take. </p>

            <p>Now that I am all alone, I will, as I walke by my selfe, weigh and consider that which Sempronio feared, concerning my trauell in this businesse. For, those things which are not well weighed, and considered, though sometimes they take good effect, yet commmonly fall out ill. So that much speculation brings foorth much good fruit; for although I dissembled with him, and did set a good face on the matter, it may be, that if my drift and intent should chance to be found out by Melibea's father, it would cost me little lesse then my life: Or at least, if they should not kill me, I should rest much impaired in my credit, either by their tossing me in a blanket, or by causing me to be cruelly whipt; so that my sweet meats shall haue sowre sauce: and my hundred Crownes in Gold <pb n="45" xml:id="ep000328-030-b"/>be purchast at too deare a rate; Ay wretched me● into what a Labyrinth haue I put my selfe? What a trap am I like to fall into, through mine owne folly? For that I might shew my selfe solicitous and resolute, I haue put my selfe vpon the hazard of the dice. Wo is me; what shall I doe? To goe backe, is not for my profit; and to goe on, stands not with my safety. Shall I persist? or shall I desist? In what a straite am I? In what a doubtfull and strange perplexity? I know not which I were best to choose. On my daringnesse dependeth manifest danger; on my cowardize shamefull damage. Which way shall the Oxe goe, out he must needs plough? Euery way, goe which way I will, discouers to my eyes deepe and dangerous furrowes; desperate downefalls; if I be taken in the manner; if the theft be found about me, I shall be either kill'd, or carted, with a paper-crowne set vpon my head, hauing my fault written in great Text-letters. But in case I should not goe, what will Sempronio then say? Is this all thou canst doe? Thy power, thy wisedome, thy stoutnesse, thy courage, thy large promises, thy faire offers, thy tricks, thy subtilties, &amp; the great care (forsooth) thou wouldst take; What? are they all come to this? And his Master Calisto, what will he say? what will hee doe? or what will hee thinke? saue onely this; That there is much deceit in my steps; and that I haue discouered this blot to Pleberio, like a preuaricating Sophistresse, or cunning Ambi-dexter, playing the traitour on both sides, that I might gaine by both? And if he doe not entertaine so hatefull a thought, he will raile vpon me like a mad-man; he will vpbraid mee to my face, with most reproachful termes; He will propose a thousand inconueniences, which my hasty deliberation was the cause of; saying, Out you old whore; Why didst thou increase my passions with thy promises? False Bawd as thou art; For all the world besides, thy feete can walke, for mee onely thy tongue; Others can haue works; I only words. Others can haue remedy at thy hands; I onely the man that must endure torment. To all others, thy force can extend it selfe; and to me is it only wanting. To all others thou art Light; to me Darkenesse. Out thou old tretcherous, disloyall wertike; Why didst thou offer thy selfe and seruice vnto me? For, it was thy offer that did put mee in hope: and that hope did delay my death, prolonged my life, and did put vpon mee the Title of a glad man. Now, for that thy promises haue not prou'd effectuall, neither shalt thou want punishment, nor I wofull despaire: so that, looke I on which side I will (miserable man that I am) it is ill here, and it is ill there; paine &amp; griefe on either hand: But when extremes shall want their meane, and no meanes to auoide either the one or the other; of two cuils, it is the wiser course to incline to the lesser. And therefore I had rather offend Pleberio, then displease Calisto. Well then, I will goe. For greater will my shame be, to be condemned for a Coward, then my punishment, in daring to accomplish what I promised. Besides, Fortune still friendeth those that <pb n="46" xml:id="ep000328-031-a"/>are bold and valiant. Lo, yonder's the gate; I haue seene my selfe in greater danger then this in my daies, Coraggio, Coraggio, Celestina; Be of good cheere; Be not dismay'd; For, there are neuer suitors wanting for the mitigating, and allaying of punishment. All Diuinations are in my fauour, and shew themselues prospicious in my proceedings; or else I am no body in this my Art, a meere bungler, an Idiot, an Asse. Of foure men that I meete by the way, three of them were Ihon's; whereof two were Cuckolds. The first word that I heard, passing along the street, was a Loue-complaint. I haue not stumbled since I came foorth, as at other times I vsed to doe. He thinkes the very stones of the streete did sunder themselues one from another, to giue me way as I past. Nor did the skirts of my clothes wrumple vp in troublesome folds, to hinder my feet. Nor do I feele any faintnesse, or wearinesse in my legs. Euery one saluteth mee. Not a dog that hath once barked at me; I haue neither seene any bird of a black feather, neither Thrush, nor Crow; nor any other of the like vnlucky nature; and which is a better signe of good lucke then all these, yonder doe I see Lucrecia, standing at Melibea's gate, which is kinsewoman to Elicia: it cannot but goe well with vs; it is impossible wee should misse of our purpose; All is Cocke-sure. </p>

            <p>My good Lady; All blessings abide with you, and your noble daughter. My many griefes and infirmities haue hindred my visiting of this your house, as in duty I was bound to doe; But heauen knowes how faire are the intralls of my inward affection, how free from any spot of foulnesse. It knowes the sincerity of my heart, and trunesse of my loue. For, distance of place displaceth not that loue, which is lodged in the heart: So that what heeretofore in my selfe I did much desire, now my necessity hath made mee to performe. And amongst other my many Crosses and miseries in this life, my Crosses in my purse grow dayly lesse and lesse; so that I haue no <pb n="48" xml:id="ep000328-032-a"/>better remedy to helpe my selfe withall, and to relieue this my poore estate, then to sell this little parcell of yarne of mine owne spinning to make Coyfes, and Kerchiefes; and vnderstanding by your maid, that you had need thereof (howbeit I am poore in euery thing, I praise my fate, saue the richnesse of this grace) it is wholy at your command, if either it or I may doe you any seruice. </p>

And life (you know) is sweete; and liuing, they come to be old.

For, (as it is in the Prouerbe) Faine would the Henne liue, for all her pip; she would not be put out of her life, to be put out of her paine. But who is hee (Lady) that can recount vnto you the inconueniences of old age? The discommodities it brings with it? it's torments, it's cares, it's troubles, it's infirmities, it's colds, it's heates, it's discontentments, it's brawles, it's janglings, it's griefes, which like so many weights lye heauy vpon it? Those deepe furrows and deepe wrinkles in the face? That change and alteration in the hayre? That fading of fresh and liuely colour? That want of hearing? That weaknesse of sight? That hollownesse in the eyes? Seeing, as if they were shut vp in a shade? That sinking and falling of the iawes? That toothlesnesse of the gummes? That failingnesse of force and of strength? That feeblenesse of legs? That slownesse in feeding? Besides, (Madame) which makes mee sigh to thinke vpon it, when all these miseries I haue told you of, come accompanied with pouerty, all sorrowes to this must stoope and strike saile, when the appetite shall be great, and the prouision small; The stomack good, and the dyet naught; For I neuer knew any worse habit, then that of hunger. </p>

            <p>Daughter, and Mistresse, there is no way so faire, but hath some foule; if you haue one mile of good, you haue three of bad. At the foote of euery hill, you haue three Leagues of ill followes. And of a thousand that liue contentedly, you haue ten thousand doe the contrary: True contentednesse, rest, renowne, glory, and quietnesse, runne from the rich by other by-conduits, and gutters of subtilty and deceit; which pipes, whereby they are conueyed, are neuer perceiued, because they are paued and brickt ouer with smooth and well wrought flatteries. He is rich that hath Gods blessing. I mary, that is wealth indeed▪ And shall I tell you, Lady? Safer it is with him that is despised, then with him that is feared. And a farre better sleepe doth the poore man take, then hee who is bound to keepe that with care which hee hath gotten with labour, and must leaue with sorrow. My friend will not dissemble with me, but the rich mans will with him; I am loued for mine owne sake; the rich man for his wealths sake. A rich man shall neuer heare the truth; euery one will flatter him, and seeke to please his humour in whatsoeuer he shall say. Besides, he lies open to euery mans enuy; and you shall scarce finde one rich man amongst a thousand, but will ingeniously confesse, that it had beene better for him to haue bin in a middling estate, or in good honest pouerty. For riches make not a man rich but busied; not a Master, but a Steward. More are they that are possessed by their riches, then they that possesse their riches. To many they haue beene a meanes of their death; and most men they haue rob'd of their pleasure, and their good and commendable qualities; and to say the truth, they are enemies to all goodnesse. Haue you not heard say, Men haue lien downe, and dream'd of their riches, and behold, they haue waked, and found nothing in their hands? Euery rich man hath a dozen of sonnes, or Nephewes, which repeate no other prayer, nor tender any other Orison to God, but that he would be pleased to take him out of this world; and desire nothing more, then to see the houre that they may come to enioy his estate; to see him vnder ground, and what was his, in their hands; and with a small charge, to lay him vp in his last and euerlasting mansion heere on earth. </p>

            <p>My wants, Madame? My necessities doe you meane? Nay, others (as I told you) not mine. For mine owne, I passe at home with my selfe in mine owne house, without letting the whole Country to know them: Eating when I may, and drinking when I can get it. For, for all my pouerty, I neuer wanted a penny to buy me bread, nor a Quarte, that is, the eighth part of sixe pence to send for wine, no, not in all this time of my widdow-hood. For before, I neuer tooke thought for any, but had alwaies a good Vessell still in my house. And when one was empty, another was full. I neuer went to bed, but I did first eat a toast well steept in wine, and two dozen of draughts, sipping still the wine after euery sop, for feare of the Mother, wherwith I was then wont to be troubled. But now, that I husband all things my self, and am at mine own finding, I am faine to fetch my wife in a little poore Iarre, which will scarce hold a pottle. And sometimes in punishment of my sinnes (which Crosse I am willing to beare) I am forced to goe sixe times a day with these my siluer hayres about my shoulders, to fill and fetch my wine my selfe at the Tauerne. Nor would I by my good will dye, till I see my selfe haue a good Rundlet or Terse of mine owne within mine owne dootes. For (on my life) there is no prouision in the world like vnto it. For as the saying is; It is bread and wine, not the young man that is spruce and fine, that makes vs rid the way, and trauell with mettle; yet let me tell you, that where the good man is missing, all other good is wanting. For ill does the spindle mooue, when the beard does not wagge aboue. And this I thought good to tell you by the way, vpon those speeches which I vsed concerning others, and not mine owne necessities. </p>

            <p>All feare fled (faire Lady) in beholding your beauty For, I cannot be perswaded, that Nature did paint in vaine one face fairer then another, more inrich't with grace and fauour, more fashionable, and more beautifull then another; were it not to make them Magazines of vertue, mansions of mercy, houses of compassion and pitie, Ministers of her blessings, and dispensers of those good gifts and graces, which in her bounty shee hath bestowed vpon them, and vpon your selfe in a more plentifull manner. Besides, sithence wee are all mortall, and borne to dye; as also, that it is most certaine, that hee cannot bee said truely to be borne, who is onely borne for himselfe; for then should men be like vnto bruite beasts, (if not worse;) Amongst which, there are some, that are very pitifull: as your Vnicorne, of whom it is reported, that hee will humble and prostrate himselfe at the feet of a Virgin. And your dogge, for all his fiercenesse, and cruelnesse of nature, when hee comes to bite another, if hee throw himselfe downe at his feet, hee will let him alone, and doe him no harme; and this is all out of pitie. Againe, to come to your birds, and fowles of the ayre; your Cocke eateth not any thing, but hee first calleth his Hens about him, and giues them part of his feeding. The Pellicane, with her beake breaketh vp her owne brest, that she may giue her very bowels and intrals to her young ones to eat. The Storkes maintaine their aged parents as long in the nest, as they did giue them food, when they were young and vnable to helpe themselues. Now, if God and Nature gaue such knowledge vnto beasts and birds; why should wee that are men, be more cruell one to another? Why giue we not part of our graces, and of our persons, to our neighbors? Especially when they are inuolued and afflicted with secret infirmities, and those such, that where the Medicine is, thence was the cause of the maladie? </p>

            <p>Mary, a certaine Charme, Madame, which (as hee is informed by many of his good friends) your Ladiship hath, which cureth the tooth-ache; as also that same admirable Girdle of yours, which is reported to haue beene found and brought from Cumae the Caue there, and was worne, 'tis thought, by the Sibilla, or Prophetesse of that place; which Girdle they say, hath such a singular and peculiar property and power, with the very tutch to abate and ease any ache or anguish whatsoeuer. Now this Gentleman I told you of, is exceedingly pained with the tooth-ache, and euen at deaths doore with it. And this was the true cause of my comming: But since it was my ill hap to receiue so harsh and vnpleasing an answer, let him still for me continue in his paine, as a punishment due vnto him, for sending so vnfortunate a messenger. For since in that muchnesse of your vertue I haue found much of your pity wanting; I feare mee, hee would also want water, should he send mee to the Sea to fetch it. And you know (sweet Lady) that the delight of vengeance, and pleasure of reuenge endureth but a moment, but that of pity and compassion continueth for euer and euer. </p>

            <p>Because my plaine and simple meaning made me beleeue, that though I should haue propos'd it in any other words whatsoeuer, had they beene worse then they were, yet would you not haue suspected any euill in them. For, if I were failing in the fitnesse of my preface, and did not vse so due and conuenient a preamble as I should haue done, it was, because truth needeth no colours. The very compassion that I had of his paine, and the confidence of your magnificency, did choake in my mouth, when I first beganne to speake the expression of the cause. And for that you know (Lady) that sorrow workes turbation, and turbation doth disorder and alter the tongue, which ought alwaies to be ty'de to the braine; for heauens loue, lay not the fault on me; and if he hath committed an errour, let not that redound to my hurt; for I am no farther blameable of any fault, then as I am the messenger of the faulty. Breake not the rope where it is weakest. Be not like the Cobweb, which neuer shewes it's force, but on poore little Flyes. No humane Law condemnes the father for the sonnes offence, nor the sonne for the <pb n="57" xml:id="ep000328-036-b"/>fathers: nor indeed (Lady) is it any reason, that his presumption should occasion my perdition; though considering his desert, I should not greatly care, that hee should be the delinquent, and my selfe be condemned, since that I haue no other Trade to liue by, saue to serue such as hee is; This is my occupation, this I make my happinesse. Yet withall (Madame) I would haue you to conceiue, that it was neuer in my desire to hurt one, to helpe another, though behind my backe, your Ladiship hath perhaps been otherwise informed of mee. But the best is, it is not the vaine breath of the vulgar, that can blast the truth; assuredly I meane nothing in this, but onely plaine and honest dealing. I doe little harme to any; I haue as few enemies in this City, as a woman can haue; I keepe my word with all men; and what I vndertake, I performe as faithfully, as if I had twenty feete, and so many hands. </p>

O thou old Celestina; cheere vp thy heart, and thinke with thy selfe; that things are halfe ended, when they are well begunne! O thou oyle of Serpents!

What newes doe they bring? whose stay hath beene so long, that I haue longed more for their comming, then the end of my remedy. O my sad eares, prepare your selues for that which you are now to heare: for in Celestina's mouth rests either my present case, or eternall heart-griefe. O that I could fall into a slumber, and passe away this short, this little, little space of time, in a dreame wherein I might see the beginning, and ending of her speech. Now I verily beleeue, that more painefull to a Fellon, is the expecting of that his cruell and capitall sentence, then the Act it selfe, of his certaine and fore-knowne death. O leaden-heeled Parmeno; slower then the Snayle, dead-handed as thou art, dispatch, I say, and vnbolt this troublesome doore, that this honourable woman may enter in, in whose tongue lies my life. </p>

            <p>No. But rather grew thereby the bolder to vtter my minde vnto her; it was the thing that I desired; it was euen as I would haue wisht it: There was nothing could haue fell out so pat for me, as to see my selfe all alone with her: then beganne I to open the very bowels and intralls of my heart; then did I deliuer my embassage, and told her in what extreme paine you liued, and how that one word of her mouth, proceeding fauourably from her, would ease you of your mighty torment. And as one standing in suspence, looking wisely and steadily vpon me, somewhat amazed at the strangenesse of my message, hearkning very attentiuely, till shee might come to know who this should be, that for want of a word of her mouth, liu'd in such great paine, and what manner of man he might be, whom her tongue was able to cure? In naming you vnto her, she did cut off my words, and with her hand strooke her selfe a blow on the brest, as one that had heard some strange and fearefull newes; charging mee to cease my prattle, and to get mee out of her sight, vnlesse I would her seruants should become my Executioners, and make short worke with me in these my old and latter dayes; aggrauating my audacious boldnesse; calling mee Witch, Sorceresse, Bawd, old Whore, false Baggage, bearded Miscreant, the Mother of mischiefe; and many other more ignominious names, wherewithall they feare children. And when she had ended with her Bugge-beares, shee beganne to fall into often swownings and trances, making many strange gestures, full of feare and amazement, all her senses being troubled, her bloud boyling within her, <pb n="72" xml:id="ep000328-044-a"/>throwing her selfe this way and that way, bearing in a strange kind of manner the members of her body one against another; and then in a strong and violent fashion, being wounded with that golden shaft, which at the very voycing of your name, had struck her to the heart, writhing and winding her body, her hands and fingers being clinched one within another, like one struggling &amp; striuing for life, that you would haue thought, shee would haue rent them asunder, hurling and rowling her eyes on euery side, striking the hard ground with her tender feete. Now, I all this while, stood me still in a corner, like a cloth that is shrunke in the wetting, as close as I could for my life, not saying so much as any one word vnto her; yet glad with all my heart, to see her in this cruell and pittifull taking. And the more her throwes and pangs were, the more did I laugh in my sleeue at it; because I thereby knew, her yeelding would be the sooner, and her fall the neerer: yet must I tell you, that whil'st her anger did foame out it's froth, I did not suffer my thoughts to be idle, nor giue them leaue to runne a wooll-gathering, but recollecting my selfe, and calling my wits about mee, I tooke hold on Times fore-top, and found a salue to heale that hurt, which my selfe had made. </p>

If Hellen were now aliue, for whom so great a slaughter was made of Greekes and Troianes, or faire Polixena, both of them would haue done their reuerence to this Lady, for whom I languish. If she had been present in that contention for the Apple with the three Goddesses, the name of contention had neuer been questioned: For without any contradiction, they would all of them haue yeelded, and ioyntly haue giuen their consent, that Melibea should haue borne it from them: so that it should rather haue been called the Apple of concord, then of discord. Besides, as many women as are now borne, and doe know her, curse themselues and their fortune; complaining of heauen, because it did not remember them, when it made her, consuming as well their bodies as their liues with enuy, being ready to eat their owne flesh for very anger, still augmenting martyrdomes to themselues, thinking to equall that perfection by arte, which Nature had bestowed vpon her without any labour. They pill, and dis-haire their eye-browes with nippers, with playsters of Pitch or Barme, and other the like instruments▪ They seeke after Wall-wort, and the like hearbs, roots, sprigs, and flowres to make Lyes, wherewithall to bring their haire to the colour of hers, spoyling and martyring their faces, clothing them with diuers colourings, glissenings, paintings, vnctions, oyntments, strong waters, white and red pargetings, which, to auoide prolixity, I repeate not.

            <p>Parmeno, my sonne; since we last talkt together, I haue not had any fit opportunitie to expresse vnto thee the infinitenesse of that loue which I beare vnto thee, and as all the world can well witnesse for mee, how well I haue spoken of thee in thy absence. Euery man, eare hath beene filled with the good reports I haue made of thee. The reason thereof I need not to repeate; for I euer held thee to be my sonne, at least, by adoption; and therefore thought thou wouldst haue shew'd thy selfe more naturall and louing towards me. But in stead thereof, thou gau'st me bad payment, euen to my face; crossing, whatsoeuer I said; thinking ill of all that I spake; whispering and murmuring against me in the presence of Calisto. I was well perswaded, that after thou hadst once yeelded to my good counsell, that you would not haue turned your heele, and kickt against me as you did, nor haue falne off from your promise. But notwithstanding all this, I perceiue some old relique yet still remaining of my former folly. And so speaking rather to satisfie thine owne humor, then that thou canst render any reason for it; thou dost hinder thy selfe of profit, to giue thy tongue contentment. Heare me (my sonne) if thou hast <pb n="81" xml:id="ep000328-048-b"/>not heard me already. Looke I, say, and consider with thy selfe, that I am old, and well strucken in yeeres; and good counsell only lodgeth with the elder sort, it being proper to youth, to follow pleasure and delight. But my hope is, that of this thy errour, thy youth onely is in fault: and I trust that you will beare your selfe better towards mee heereafter, and that you will alter your ill purpose, together with your tender yeeres; For as it is in the Prouerbe: Our customes suffer change, together with our hayres; and wee vary our disposition, as we vary our yeeres. I speake this (my sonne) because as we grow in age, so grow we in experience; new things daily offring themselues to our view: for youth lookes no farther then to things present, occupying his eie only in that he sees set before him; but riper yeeres omit neither things present, things past, nor things to come. And sonne Parmeno, if you would but bethink your selfe of the loue I haue heeretofore borne you, I know it cannot escape your knowledge, that the first nights lodging that you tooke, when you were a stranger, and came newly to this City, was in my house. But you young men care not for vs that are old; but gouerne your selues according to the sauour and relish of your owne palates; you neuer think that you haue, or shall haue need of vs: you neuer thinke vpon sicknesse; you neuer think, that this flowre of your youth shall fade. But doe you heare me, (my friend) and marke what I say vnto you; That in such cases of necessitie, as these, an old woman, (bee shee well experienced) is a good helpe, a comforter, a friend, a mother; nay, more then a mother: A good Inne, to giue ease and rest to a sound man; and a good Hospitall for to cure a sicke man; a good Purse in time of need; a good Chest, to keepe money in prosperitie; a good Fire in winter, inuironed with spits of good rost-meat; a good Shade in summer, and a good Tauerne to eate and drinke in. Now my pretty little foole, what sai'st thou to all this? What dost thou thinke of it? I know, thou art by this time ashamed of that which thou hast spoken to day; thou can'st not say B to a Battle-doore; thou art strucke so dumbe, and so dead: and therefore I will presse thee no further, nor craue any more at thy hands, then that which friendship craues of thee, which is, Looke vpon Sempronio; next vnder heauen, my selfe haue made him a man; I could wish you would liue and loue together as brothers and friends: for being in league with him, thou shalt liue in the fauor and loue of thy Master, and in good repute with all the world: for Sempronio, I tell thee, is well belou'd, hee is diligent, a good Courtier, a proper seruant, a fellow of a good fashion, and one that is willing to imbrace thy friendship, which will turne to both your profits, if you will but hand-fast your affections each to other. Besides, you know, that you must loue, if you will be beloued. Trowtes cannot bee taken with drie breeches. And if the Cat will haue fish, she must wet her foote. Nor does Sempronio owe this of right vnto thee; nor is hee bound to loue thee, vnlesse thou exchange loue for loue: it is meere <pb n="82" xml:id="ep000328-049-a"/>simplicitie, not to be willing to loue, and yet looke to be beloued of others. And as great folly, to repay friendship with hatred. </p>

You two are equalls, and paritie of persons, similitude of manners, and simpathy of hearts are the maine props that vp-hold friendship. Take heed (my sonne;) for if thou hast any thing, it is safely kept for thee. Be thou wise to gaine more, for this is gain'd already to your hands. Your father, O what paines tooke hee for it!

            <p>Mary sonne, to liue of your selfe. Not to goe thorow other mens houses, nor to set thy foote vnder another mans table: which thou shalt still bee inforced to doe, vnlesse thou learne to make profit of thy seruice; for out of very pitty to see thee goe thus totred and torne, not hauing a ragge almost to hang on thy breeche, did I beg that mantle which thou saw'st, of Calisto, not so much for the mantles sake, as for that there being a Taylor belonging to the house, and thou before being without a Ierkin, hee might bestow it vpon thee. So that I speake not for mine owne profit, (as I heard you say) but for thy good. For, if you rely onely vpon the ordinary wages of these Gallants, it is such, that what you get by it after tenne yeeres seruice, you may put it in your eye and neuer see the worse. Inioy thy youth, good daies, good nights, good meate, and good drinke; when thou mai'st haue these things, lose them not; Let that be lost that will be lost. Doe not thou mourne for the wealth which was left thy Master (for that will but shorten thy daies) sithence wee can inioy it no longer then wee liue. O Sonne <pb n="83" xml:id="ep000328-049-b"/>Parmeno, (and well may I call thee sonne, since I had the breeding of thee so long a time) follow my counsell, seeing it proceeds out of pure loue, and an earnest desire, to see thee grow vp in honour.

            <p>Sonne, no more. For mine eyes already runne ouer, and my teares beginne to breake ouer those bankes, which should bound them in. O! had I in all this world, but such another friend? Such another companion? Such a comfortresse in my troubles? Such an easer, and lightner of my hearts heauinesse? Who did supply my wants? Who knew my secrets? To whom did I discouer my heart? Who was all my happinesse, and quietnesse, but thy mother? She was neerer and dearer vnto me, then my gossip, or mine owne sister. O! how well-fauored was she, and cheerefull of countenance? How lustie? How quicke? How neate? How portly and maiesticall in her gate? How stout and manly? Why, shee would goe you at midnight without or paine, <pb n="84" xml:id="ep000328-050-a"/>or feare, from Church-yard, to Church-yard, seeking for implements appertaining to our Trade, as if it had been day. Nor did she omit either Christians, Moores, or Iewes, whose Graues and Sepulchres she did not visit. By day she would watch them, and by night shee would dig them out; taking such things as should serue her turne. So that she tooke as great pleasure in darknesse of the night, as thou dost comfort in the brightnesse of the day. She would vsually say; that the night was the sinfull mans cloak, that did hide and couer all his rogueries, that they might not be seene, though perhaps she had not the like dexteritie and skill in all the rest of those tricks that appertāined to her Trade: yet one thing shall I tell thee, because thou shall see what a mother thou hast lost, though I was about to keepe it in; but it makes no matter, it shall out to thee. She did pull out seuen teeth out of a fellowes head that was hang'd, with a paire of Pincers, such as you pull out stubbed haires withall; whil'st I did pull off his shooes. She was excellent at a Circle, and would enter it farre better then my selfe, and with greater boldnes, though I also was very famous for it in those dayes, more I wisse, then I am now; who haue together with her, lost almost my cunning. What shall I say more vnto thee, but that the very Diuels themselues did liue in feare of her? Shee did hold them in horrour, and dread, making them to tremble and quake, when shee beganne to exercise her exorcismes, her spels, her incantations, her charmes, her coniurations, and other words of most horrisonous roaring, and most hideous noyse. Shee was as well knowne to them all, as the begger knowes his dish; or as thy selfe in thine owne house. One Diuell comming tumbling in vpon the necke of another, as fast, as it pleased her to call them vp, and not one of them durst tell her a lye; such power had shee to binde them: so that euer since shee dy'd, I could neuer attaine to the truth of any thing. Parmeno, may this woman no better thriue, then shee pleaseth mee with those her wordy prayses. </p>

Shee had to doe with all manner of persons; shee talked with all sorts of people. If wee walked the streetes, as many as we met, they were all of them her God-sonnes.

            <p>Mary I say, sonne, that besides this, your mother was taken foure seuerall times, shee her selfe alone: and once shee was accused for a Witch; For shee was found one night by the watch, with certaine little candles in her hand, gathering I know not what earth in a crosse way; for which shee stood halfe a day in the open market-place vpon a Scaffold, with a high paper Hat, like the coffin of a Suger-loafe, painted full of Diuels, whereon her fault was written (being brought thither, riding thorow the streetes vpon an Asse, as the fashion is in the punishment of Bawds &amp; Witches.) Yet all this was nothing; for men must suffer something in this wicked world, for to vp-hold their liues, and their honours. And marke, I pray, what small reckoning they made of it, because of her great wisdome and discretion. For shee would not for all this, giue ouer her old occupation; and from that day forward followed it more earnestly, then shee did before, and with happier proofe. This I thought good to tell you, to crosse that opinion of yours, touching perseuerance in that, wherein we haue once already erred; for all that shee did, did so well become her, and such a grace had she with her, that vpon my conscience, howbeit she stood thus disgracefully <pb n="86" xml:id="ep000328-051-a"/>vpon the Scaffold, euery one might perceiue, that shee cared not a button for those that stood beneath, staring and gazing vpon her; such was her behauiour and carriage at that instant: looke they might their fill, but I warrant you, she was not a farthing in debt, no not to the proudest of them all; wherein, I thought fit to instance, to shew thereby vnto you; that they, who haue any thing in them as shee had, and are wise, and of worth, fall farre more easily and sooner into errour, then any other. Doe but weigh and consider with your selfe, what a manner of man Virgil was; how wise in all kinde of knowledge; and yet I am sure you haue heard, how in a wicker basket hee was hung out from a Towre, all Rome looking vpon him; yet for all this, was hee neither the lesse honoured, neyther lost he the name of Virgil. </p>

And the rather, because it was commonly spoken of all men, that wrongfully, and against all right and reason, by suborning of false witnesses, and cruell torments, they inforced her to confesse that, which in realitie of truth was not. But because shee was a woman of a great spirit, and good courage, and her heart had beene accustomed to endure, shee made matters lighter then they were; And of all this, shee reckoned not a Pinne: for a thousand times haue I heard her say; If I broke my legge, it was all for my good; for this made mee better knowne then I was before. And certainely so shee was, and the more noted and respected, nay, and thriued the better by it, both she and I, and the more plentifull our haruest and incomes of customers of the best, and wee loued and liued merrily together to her last.

            <p>Alack (poore heart) how I pitty thee: that one so plump, so faire, so cleare, so fresh, so fragrant, so delicate, so dainty a creature, that art indeede the very abstract of beauty, the most admired modell for complexion, feature, comelinesse, and rarest composure; euery Limme, euery Lineament carrying such an extraordinary lustre and ornament by reflection from thee. I say, How doe I pitty thee, that any ache, sicknesse, or infirmity should dare to seaze, or presume to vsurp ouer such a Peerelesse Potent, a commanding Power, as thy imperious vnparaleld beauty! But I dare say, it is not so, nor so; No no, your disease is selfe-conceited, and the pride of your good parts, this puffs you and makes you slight and contemne all. Goe to, goe to, (daughter) you are to blame if it be so, and I tell you, it is a shame for you, that it is, not to impart these good graces and blessings, which heauen hath bestowed vpon you, to as many as wish you well; For they were not giuen you in vaine, that you should let them wither, and lose the flowre of your youth vnder sixe linings of Woollen, and Linnen; haue a care, that you be not couetous of that, which cost you but little; doe not like, a Miser, <pb n="91" xml:id="ep000328-052-b"/>hoord vp your beauty; make not a hidden treasure of it, sithence in it's owne nature it is as communicable, and as commonly currant as money from man to man. Be not the Mastiue in the garden, nor the Dog in the manger: and since thou canst not take any pleasure in thy selfe, let others take their pleasure▪ and do not think thou wast borne for nothing: for when thou wast borne, man was borne: and when man was borne, woman was borne; nothing in all this wide world was created superfluous, nor which Nature did not prouide for with very good consonancy, and well suiting with reason. But thinke on the contrary, That it is a fault to vexe and torment men, when it is in thy power to giue them remedy. </p>

Euery strong sent is good: as Penny-royall, Rue, Wormewood, smoake of Partridge feathers, of Rosemary, and of the Soles of old shooes, and of Muske-roses, of Incense, of strong perfumes, receiued kindly, fully, and greedily, doth worke much good; much slaketh and easeth the paine, and by little and little returnes the Mother to it's proper place.

And you vse these niceties, you shall neuer haue a house with a double roome, but liue like a begger all the daies of your life. What? are you afraide of our Sweet-heart now he is absent? What would you then doe, were he now in Towne? It hath euer beene my ill fortune, to giue counsell vnto fooles, such as cannot see their owne good; say what I will, they will erre; still stand in their owne light. But I doe not much wonder at it; For though the world be wide, yet there are but few wise in it. Great is the largenesse of the earth, but small the number of those that haue experience. Ha, daughter! Did you but see your cousins wisedome, or but know what benefit my breeding, and counsell hath brought her, how cunning, how witty, and what a Mistresse in her arte; you would be of another minde; say, what I will vnto her, shee patiently indures my reprehensions, shee hearkens to my aduice, and does all what I will haue her doe; shee will sometimes boast, that shee hath at one time had one in bed with her; another wayting at the doore; and a third sighing for her within the house; and yet hath giuen good satisfaction to them all. And art thou afraide, who hast but two to deale withall; Can one cock fill all thy Cisternes? One conduit-pipe water all thy Court? If this be your diet, you may chance to rise a hungred, you shall haue no meate left against another time; I will not rent your fragments; I cannot liue vpon scraps; One could neuer please mee; I could neuer place all my affection vpon one; two can doe more then one; they giue more, and they haue more to giue. It goes hard (Daughter) with that Mouse, that hath but one hole to trust to; for if that be stopt, shee hath no meanes to hide her selfe from the Cat: he that hath but one eye, you see in what danger he goes? One sole Act maketh not a Habit. It is a rare, and strange thing to see a Partridge flye single; to feed alwaies vpon one dish, brings a loathing to the stomacke; one Swallow makes not a Summer; one witnesse alone is of no validitie in Law. Hee that hath but one suite of clothes, and shee that hath but one gowne to her backe, quickly weares them out. What would you doe (daughter) with this number of one? Many more inconueniences can I tell thee of this single soale number (if one may be a number.) If you be wise, be neuer without two; for it is a laudable and commendable company, as you may see it in your selfe; who hath two eares, two feet, and two hands; two sheets vpon one bed; and two smockes wherewith to shift you; and the more you haue, the better it is for you; for still, (as it is in the Prouerbe) The more Moores, the better market; and honour without profit, is no other but as a Ring vpon the finger. And because one Sacke cannot hold them both, <pb n="94" xml:id="ep000328-054-a"/>apply your selfe to your profit, Sonne Parmeno, come vp. </p>

And though shee bred thee vp, I am better acquainted with her qualities, then you are. That which shee doth ruminate: how many crack't maiden-heads shee hath then in cure; how many Louers in this City; how many young wenches are recommended vnto her; what Stewards afford her prouision; which is the more bountifull: and how she may call euery man by his name; that when shee chanceth to meet them, shee may not salute them as strangers. When you see her lips goe, then is she inuenting of lies, and deuising sleights, and tricks for to get money; then doth she thus dispute with her selfe; In this maner will I make my speech; In this fashion will I cloze with him.

For I can liue no longer, then while I talke with one of these two. Euer since that I was growne in yeeres, I know no better office at boord, then to fall a skinking, and to furnish the Table with pots and flagons: For he that handles hony, shall feele it still clinging to his fingers. Besides, in a cold winters night, you cannot haue a better warming-panne. For, when I tosse off two of these little pots, when I <pb n="106" xml:id="ep000328-061-a"/>am e'en ready to goe into my bed, why, I feele not a iot of cold all the night long. With this, I furre all my clothes at Christmas: This warmes my blood; This keepes me still in one estate; This makes mee merry, where-e're I goe; This makes me looke fresh, and ruddy, as a Rose. Let me still haue store of this in my house, and a figge for a deare yeere, it shall neuer hurt mee: for one crust of Mouse-eaten bread will serue me three whole dayes; This driues away all care and sorrow from the heart, better then either Gold or Corall; This giues force to a young man, and vigour to an old man; It addes colour to the discoloured; courage to the coward; diligence to the slothfull; it comforteth the braine; it expels cold from the stomacke; it takes away the stinkingnesse of the breath; it makes cold constitutions, to be potent and actiue: it makes husbandmen endure the toyle of tillage; it makes your painefull and weary mowers to sweat out all their watrish ill humours; it remedies Rheumes; and cures the tooth-ache. This may you keepe long at Sea without stinking; so can you not water: I could tell you more properties of this wholsome liquor, than all of you haue hayres on your head. So that I know not the man, whom it doth not delight to heare it but mentioned, the very name of it is so pleasing: onely, it has but this one fault: That that which is good, costs vs deare; and that which is bad, does vs hurt; So that what maketh the Liuer sound, the same maketh the purse light; but for all this, I will be sure to seeke after the best; for that little which I drinke, which is onely some dozen times a meale. Which number, I neuer passe, vnlesse now, when I am feasted, or so. </p>

            <p>Let it come when it will come, it shall be welcome, when e're it comes. A cassocke is good weare after winter. And sleeues are good after Easter: Euery thing makes the heart merry that is gotten with ease, and without any labour, especially comming from thence, where it leaues so small a gap, and from a man of that wealth and substance, who with the very branne and scraps of his house, would make me of a begger, to become rich: such is the surplus and store of his goods; and such as hee, it neuer grieues them what they spend, considering the cause wherefore they giue: For they feele it not; when they are in the heat and passion of their loue, it paines them not; they neither see, nor heare; which I iudge to be true by others, that I haue knowne to be lesse passionate, and lesse scorched in the fiery flames of loue, then Calisto is; in so much, that I haue seen them neither eat nor drink; neither laught nor weep; neither sleep nor wake; neither speake nor hold their peace; neither liue in paine, nor yet finde ease; neither be contented, nor yet complaine of discontentment, answerable to the perplexity of that sweet and cruell wound of their hearts. And if naturall necessity forceth them to any one of these, they are so wholly forgetfull of themselues, and strucke into such sudden senslesnesse of their present being and condition, that eating, their hands forget to carry their meat to their mouthes: Besides, if you talke with them, they neuer answer you directly. Their bodies are there with you, but where they loue, there are their hearts, and their senses. Great is the force of loue. His power doth not only reach ouer the earth, but passeth also ouer the seas. He holds an equall command ouer all mankinde. He breaks thorow all kinde of difficulties; and dangers whatsoeuer. It is a tormentfull thing, full of feare, and of care. His eye roles euery way; nothing can escape him. And if any of you that be heere, <pb n="113" xml:id="ep000328-063-a"/>ing perhaps 100. stripes vpon them, and afterwards thrust them out of dores, with their haire about their cares, and their fardles at their backs, rating them in most vile manner, crying, Out of my doors, you thiefe, you whore, you strumpet: this is no place for such paltry baggages. Thou shalt not spoyle my house, I will not be thus dishonoured by thee. So that in stead of expected recompence, they receiue nothing but bitter reuilements. Where they expect to goe preferred out of the house, they goe preiudiced out of the house. And where they expect to be well married, they are quite mar'd in their reputation. And where they expect iewels and wedding apparell, there are they sent out naked, and disgraced: these are their rewards, these their benefits, and these the payments they receiue for their seruice. They are bound to giue them husbands, and in liew thereof, they strip them of their clothes. The greatest grace and honour which they haue in their Ladies house, is to be imployed in walking the streetes from one Ladie to another, and to deliuer their Ladies message▪ (As, My Lady hath sent to know how you doe? how you did rest to night? how your physicke wrought with you; and how many occasions it gaue your Ladiship, &amp; c?) They neuer heare their owne name out of their Ladies mouth. But the best they can call them by, is, Come hither, you whore, Get you gone, you drabbe, or I'll set you going: Whither gadde you now, you mangy harlotry; you pockey slut? what haue you done to day, you loytring Queane? why did you eate this, you rauening thing, you gor-belly, you greedy cormorant? A you filthy Sow, how cleane this frying panne is kept? This pispot (Minion) it is well scowr'd, is it not? why you lazy bones, did you not brush my clothes, when I left them off, and make cleane my Mantle? Why said you thus and thus, you Sot, you foolish Asse? Who lost the piece of plate, you scatter-good, you draggle-tayle? Whats become of my handkercher, you purloyning thiefe? you haue giuen it to one of your copes-mates, some sweet-heart of yours, that must helpe to make you a whore: Come hither, you foule flappes, say▪ Where is my Henne, my cramm'd Henne, that I cannot finde her? you were best looke her mee out, and that quickly too, vnlesse you meane I shall make you pay for her, when I come to pay you your wages. And besides all this, her pantofles shall walke about her eares a thousand times a day; pinchings, cudgellings, and scourgings shall be as common to her as her meat and drinke. There is not any that knowes how to please and content them; not any that can indure their tartnesse and curstnesse: their delight is to speake loud; their glory to chide and to brawle, and the better one does, and the more one seeks to please them, the lesse are they contented. And this (mother) is the reason, why I haue rather desires to liue free from controlement, and to be mistresse in a poore little house of mine owne, then to liue a slaue, and at command in the richest palace of the proudest Lady of them all. </p>

            <p>So great, daughter? hold you this so great a meeting? It appeares that you haue not knowne me in my prosperity, which is now some twenty yeeres since. There be those that haue seene mee in better case then I am now; and hee that now sees mee, I wonder his heart doth not burst with sorrow. I tell thee, (wench) I haue seene at this table, where your kinswomen now sit, nine gallant young wenches, much about your age; for the eldest was not aboue eighteene, and not one of them vnder foureteene. But such is this world, it comes and goes vpon wheeles. We are like pots in a water-wheele, or like buckets in a Well; one vp, and another downe, one full, and another empty; it is fortunes Law, that nothing can continue any long time in one, and the selfe-same state of being. Her order is alteration; Her custome, change. I cannot without teares deliuer vnto you the great honour I then liu'd in; though now, (such is my ill fortune) by little and little, it hath gone decaying▪ And as my daies declined; so diminished and decreased my profit. It is an old saying; That whatsoeuer is in this world, it doth either increase or decrease. Euery thing hath it's limits; Euery thing it's degrees of more or lesse: my honour did mount to that height, as was fitting for a woman of my quality to rise vnto; and now of force, it must descend and fall as much: By this I know, that I am neere to my end, and that the Lease of my life is now expiring, and all my yeeres are almost spent and gone: and I also well know, that I did ascend, that I might descend; that I flourished, for to wither; that I had ioy, that I might haue sorrow; that I was borne to liue; liu'd, to grow; grew, to grow old; and grow old to dye: and though it did alwaies appeare vnto me, that I ought in this respect to suffer my misery the more patiently, yet as I am formed of flesh and bloud▪ and beare this heauy masse of sinne about me, I cannot but thinke on't now and then with griefe, nor can I wholy as I would, blot euery thought thereof out of the wofull role of my wretched remembrance. </p>

            <p>Paines, Sweet-heart? Nay, they were an ease, and pleasure vnto me; they did all of them obey me; they did all of them <pb n="114" xml:id="ep000328-064-a"/>honour me; they did all of them reuerence mee: not one of them that would swarue from my will: what I said, stood for a Law; it was good and currant amongst them; not any one of them, to whom I gaue entertainement, euer made their owne choise any further then it stood with my liking; were he lame, crooked, squint-ey'd, or crippled: all was one, he was the welcom'st and the soundest, that brought me the soundest gaines; mine was the profit, and theirs the paines. Besides, I needed no seruants; for in keeping them, I had seruants enow. Why, your Noblemen, your Knights, your old men, your young men, your learned men, men of all sorts and dignities, from the highest to the lowest; why, they were all at my seruice: and when I came to a feast, my foote was no sooner in, but I had presently as many Bonnets vailed vnto me, as if I had been a Dutchesse: he that had least acquaintance, least businesse with me, was held the most vile, and basest fellow. They spying me almost a League off; they would forsake their most earnest occasions, one by one, two by two, and come to me, to see if I would command them any seruice; and withall, aske me seuerally, how his loue, how his mistresse did? When they saw me once passe by, you should haue such a shuffling and scraping of feet, and all in such a generall gaze, and so out of order, that they did neither doe nor say any thing aright. One would call mee mistresse, another Aunt, others their loue, others honest old woman. There, they would consent, when they should come to my house: there they would agree when I should goe vnto theirs; there they would offer mee mony; there they would make me large promises; there likewise present me with gifts: some kissing the lappet of my Coat; and some other my cheeke, that by these kindesses, they might giue mee contentment, and worke me to their will. But now Fortune hath brought mee to so low a place in her wheele, that you may say vnto me, Mich you good dich you with your old ware, you hindges are now growne rustie for want of oyling. </p>

            <p>No (my son) Ioue forbid that I should raise any such report, or lay a generall scandall vpon any of their ranke. For, there were many old good men amongst them, with whom I had but small dealings, and could scarce endure to see me: But amongst the greatest, as they grew great in number, so had I a great number of them: some of one sort, and some of another; some I found very chaste, and some that took the charge vpon them to maintaine such Traders as my selfe. And I am still of this beliefe, that of these there is no lack; and these, forsooth, would send their Squires and young men to waite vpon me, whithersoeuer I went: and I should scarce haue set my foote within mine owne doores, but straight at the heeles of me, <pb n="115" xml:id="ep000328-064-b"/>you should haue one come in with chickens, another with Hens, a third with Geese, a fourth with Ducks. This man sends me in Partriges, that man Turtle Doues, he a gammon of Bacon, such a one a Tart, or a Custard; and some good fellow or other a good sucking Pigge, or two: for euery one, as soone as he had a conuenient present, so they came presently to register them in my house; that I, and those their pretty soules, might merrily eat them together: and as for wine, we wanted none; the best that a man could lay his lips to in the whole City, was sent vnto me from diuers parts and corners of the Towne: as that of Monviedro, of Lugne, of Toro, of Madrigall, of San-Martin, and many other Townes and Villages; And indeed so many, that albeit I still keepe the differences of their taste and relish in my mouth, yet doe I not retaine the diuersity of their foyles in my remembrance. For it is enough for such an old woman as I, that when a good cuppe of wine comes neer my nose, I can be able to say, This is such a wine, or it comes from such a place, or person; why, your presents from all parts, from all sorts came vpon me as thicke as hops, as flies to a pot of hony, or as stones that are throwne vpon a stage: boyes came tumbling in at my doore, with as much prouision, as they could carry on their backs. But now those good daies are past, I haue eaten all my white bread in my youth, and know not how in the world to liue, being fallen from so happy an estate. </p>

            <p>Madame, as farre as humane knowledge can discerne of inward griefe, I dare presume. And for as much, as for the health and remedy of infirmities, and diseases, these graces were imparted vnto men, for the finding out of fit and conuenient medicines, whereof some were attained to by experience, some by Art, and some by a naturall instinct; some small portion of these good gifts, this poore old creature my selfe haue gotten, who is heere present to doe you the best seruice she can. </p>

            <p>O how acceptable and pleasing are thy words to mine eares! it is a comfortable thing to the sicke patient, to see his physician to look cheerfully vpon him. Me thinks I see my heart broken betweene thy hand in pieces, which with a little labour, and by power and vertue of thy tongue, thou art able (if thou wilt) to ioyne together, and make it whole againe; euen as easily, as Alexander that great King of Macedon dream't of that wholesome roote in the mouth of a Dragon, wherewith he healed his seruant Ptolomy, who had beene bitten by a Viper; and therefore, for the loue of Ioue, disroabe your selfe, that you may more easily, and more diligently looke into the nature of my disease, and affoord me some remedy for it. </p>

            <p>A great part of health, is the desiring of health. And a good signe of mending, to be willing to mend. For which reason I reckon your griefe the lesse, and hold it the lesse dangerous; But that I may minister a wholesome medicine vnto you, and such a one as may be agreeable to your disease; it is requisite, that you first satisfie me in these three particulars. The first is, on which side of your body your paine doth lye most? The second, how long you haue had this paine; whether it hath taken you but of late, or <pb n="119" xml:id="ep000328-066-b"/>no? For your newly growing infirmities are sooner cured in the tendernesse of their growth, then when they haue taken deepe rooting by ouer-long perseuering in their office: So beasts are sooner tamed when they are young, and more easily brought to the yoake, then when their hide is throughly hardned: So far better doe those plants grow vp, and prosper, which are remooued when they are young and tender, then those that are transplanted, hauing long borne fruit. The third is, whether this your euill hath proceeded of any cruell thought, which hath taken hold on you? This being made knowne, you shall see mee set my selfe roundly to worke about your cure; for it is very fit and conuenient, that you should open the whole truth, as well to your Physician, as your Confessour. </p>

            <p>Friend, Celestina, Thou wise Matrone, and great Mistresse in thy Art, thou hast well opened vnto me the way, by which I may manifest my maladie vnto thee. Beleeue me, you haue questioned me like a wise woman, and like one that is well experienced in these kind of sickenesses. My paine is about my heart, it's residence, neere vnto my left Pappe; but disperseth it selfe ouer euery part of my body. Secondly, it hath beene so but of late; nor did I euer thinke, that any paine whatsoeuer could haue so depriued me of my vnderstanding, as this doth; it troubles my sight, changes my countenance, takes away my stomacke, I cannot sleepe for it, nor will it suffer mee to inioy any kinde of pleasure: touching the thought, which was the last thing you demanded, concerning my disease, I am not able to deliuer it vnto you, and as little the cause thereof; For neither death of kinsfolke, nor losse of temporall goods, nor any sudden passion vpon any vision, nor any doting dreame, nor any other thing can I coniecture to be the cause of it, saue onely a kinde of alteration, caused by your selfe vpon your request, which I suspected in the behalfe of that Gentleman Calisto, when you entreated me for my Charme. </p>

            <p>My most deare both Lady &amp; friend, wonder not so much at this; for those ends, that haue their effect, giue me daringnesse to indure those craggy and dangerous by-waies, by which I come to such Recluses as your selfe. True it is, that vntill I had resolued with my selfe, as well on my way hitherwards, as also heere in your house, I stood in great doubt, whether were I best discouer my petition vnto you or no? When I did thinke on the great power of your father, then did I feare; but when withall, I weygh'd the noblenesse of Calisto, then I grew bold againe; when I obserued your discretion, I waxed timorous; but when I considered your vertue, and your courtesie, I recouered new courage: in the one, I found feare; in the other, safety. And since, Madame, you haue beene willing to grace me with the discouery of so great a fauour, as now you haue <pb n="124" xml:id="ep000328-069-a"/>made knowne vnto mee, declare your will vnto mee, lay your secrets in my lappe; put into my hands the managing of this matter, and I will giue it such a forme, as both you and Calisto shall very shortly accomplish your desires. </p>

            <p>Madame, long afore this, I perceiued your wound, and sounded your desire: I did much pitty your torment; for, the more you sought to hide from me the fire which did burne you, the more did those flames manifest themselues in the colour of your face, in the little quietnesse of your heart, in the restlesnes of your members, in your tossing to and fro, in eating without any appetite, and in your vnablenesse to sleepe: So that I did continually see from time to time, as plainely as if I had beene within you, most manifest, and apparant signes of your wretched estate; but because in that instant, when as will reigneth in those whom we serue, or a disordinate appetite, it is fitting for vs that are seruants, to obey them with bodily diligence, and not to checke and controle them with the Artificiall counsels of the tongue. And therefore did I suffer with <pb n="125" xml:id="ep000328-069-b"/>paine, held my peace with feare, concealed with fidelity; though I alwaies held it better to vse sharpe Counsell then smooth flattery. But since that your Ladiship hath no other remedy for your recouerie, but either to die or to liue; it is very meete, that you should make choice of that for the best, which in it selfe is best. </p>

Melibea is pained more for you, then you for her: Melibea loues you, and desires to see you: Melibea spends more houres in thinking vpon you, then on her selfe: Melibea calls her selfe thine; and this shee holds as a Title of libertie, and with this, shee allayes that fire, which burnes more in her, then thy selfe. </p>

It is strange, Sir, that you will not consider who you are, nor the time that you haue spent in her seruice; nor the person, whome you haue made to be your meanes: And likewise, that hitherto, thou hast euer beene in doubt of hauing her, and yet didst still endure all with patience; and now, that I doe certifie vnto thee the end of thy torment, wilt thou put an end to thy life? Consider, consider, I pray, with thy selfe, that Celestina is on thy side; and that although all should be wanting vnto thee, which in a Louer were to be required, I would sell thee for the most complete gallant of the world; for I would make for thee mountaines of most craggy rocks, to grow plaine, and smooth.

            <p>How wittily this Asse thinks he hath spoken! I sweare to thee, by the reuerence of this my old age, had these words beene spoken after dinner, I should haue said, that wee had all of vs taken a cuppe too much; that we had beene all drunke. Art thou well in thy wits, Sempronio? What has thy remuneration to doe with my reward? Thy payment with my merit? Am I bound to buy you weapons? Must I repaire your losses, and supply your wants? Now I thinke vpon it; let me be hang'd, or dye any other death, if thou hast not tooke hold of a little word, that carelesly slipt out of my mouth the other day, as we came along the street; for as (I remember) I then told you, that what I had was yours; and that I would neuer be wanting vnto you in any thing, to the vtmost of my poore ability; and that if Fortune did prosper my businesse with your Master, that you should lose nothing by it; But you know (Sempronio) that words of compliment and kindnesse, are not obligatory, nor binde me to doe, as you would haue mee; all is not gold that glisters, for then it would be a great deale cheaper then it is. Tell me (Sempronio) if I haue not hit the right nayle on the head? Thou maist see by this, that though I am old, that I can diuine as much as thou canst imagine. In good faith (Sonne) I am as full of griefe, as euer my heart can hold, I am euen ready to burst with sorrow and anguish. As soone as euer I came from your house, and was come home; I gaue the chaine I brought hither with me, to this foole Elicia, that she might looke vpon it, and cheere her selfe with the sight thereof; and she, for her life, cannot as yet call to mind what shee hath done with it: and all this liue-long night, neither shee nor I haue slept one winke, for very thought and griefe thereof: Not so much for the valew of the chaine (for it was not much worth) but to see, that she should be so carelesse in the laying of it vp; and to see the ill lucke of it; at the very same time that we mist it, came in some friends of mine, that had beene of my old and familiar acquaintance; and I am sorely afraide, lest they haue lighted vpon it, and taken it away with them; meaning to make vse of that vulgar saying, Si spie it, tum sporte fac; Si non spie it, packe and away Iacke. But now (my Sonnes) that I may come a little neerer vnto you both, and speake home to the point: If your Master gaue mee any thing, what he gaue me, that (you must thinke) is mine: As for your cloth of gold doublet, I neuer ask't you any share out of it, nor euer will. We all of vs serue him, that he may giue vnto vs all, as he sees wee shall deserue: And as for that which he hath giuen me, I haue twice indangered my life for it; more blades haue I blunted in his seruice then you both; more materiall and substantiall stuffe haue I wasted, and haue worne out more hose and shooes; And you must not thinke (my Sonnes) but all this costs mee good money. Besides, my skill, which I got not playing or sitting still, or warming my taile ouer the fire, as most of your idle huswiues doe, but with hard labour and paines-taking: as Parmeno's mother could <pb n="145" xml:id="ep000328-079-b"/>well witnesse for me, if she were liuing. This I haue gained by mine owne industry and labour; as for you, what haue you done? If you haue done any thing for Calisto, Calisto is to requite you. I get my liuing by my Trade and my trauell; you, yours, with recreation and delight; and therefore you are not to expect equall recompence, inioying your seruice with pleasure, as I, who goe performing it with paines: but whatsoeuer I haue hitherto said vnto you, because you shall see, I will deale kindely with you: if my chaine be found againe, I will giue each of you a paire of Scarlet Breeches, which is the comeliest habit that young men can weare. But if it be not found, you must accept of my good will, and my selfe be content to sit downe with my losse; and all this I doe out of pure loue, because you were willing that I should haue the benefit of managing this businesse before another: and if this will not content you, I cannot doe withall. To your owne harme be it. </p>

O my ioyes, how doe you goe declining, and waining from me! But it is an ancient Prouerbe; That the higher a man climbes, the greater is his fall. Last night I gained much; today I haue lost much. Your Sea-calmes are rare, &amp; seldome. I might haue beene listed in the roll of the happy, if my fortune would but haue allayd these tempestuous winds of my perdition. O Fortune▪ how much, and thorow how many parts hast thou beaten mee! But howsoeuer thou dost shake my house, and how opposite soeuer thou art vnto my person, yet are aduersities to be endured with an equall courage: and by them, the heart is prooued, whether it be of Oke, or Elder, strong, or weake; there is no, better Say, or Touchstone in the world, to know what finenesse, or what Characts of Vertue or of Fortitude remain in man. And therefore come what will come, fall backe, fall edge, I will not desist to accomplish her desire, for whose sake all this hath hapned. For it is better for mee to pursue the benefit of that glory, which I expect, then the losse of those that are dead. They were proud, and stout, and would haue beene slaine at some other time, if not now. The old woman was wicked and false, as it seemes, in her dealings, not complying with that contract which shee had made with them: so that they fell out about the true mans cloake; taking it from the true owner, to share it amongst themselues. But this was a iust iudgement of God vpon her, that she should receiue this payment, for the many adulteries, which by her intercession and meanes haue beene committed. Sosia and Tristianico shall prouide themselues; they shall accompany me, in this my desired walke; they shall carry the Scaling-ladders, for the walls are very high. To morrow I will abroad, and see if I can reuenge their deaths; if not, I will purge my innocency with a fained absence; or else faine my selfe mad, that I may the better inioy this so tastefull a delight of my sweet Loue; as did that great Captaine Vlysses, to shunne the Troiane warre, that hee might lie dulcing at home with his wife Penelope. </p>

            <p>My Masters, what a noise make you there? My cares and yours are not alike. Enter softely, I pray, and leaue your pratling, that they in the house may not heare vs; Shut this doore, and let vs go take our rest. For, I will vp alone to my chamber, and there disarme mee. Goe get you to bed; O wretch that I am, how sutable and naturall vnto mee is solitarinesse, silence, and darkenes. I know not whether the cause of it be, that there commeth now to minde, the treason that I haue committed in taking my leaue of that Lady, whom I so dearelie loue, before it was further day? Or whether it be the griefe, which I conceiue of my dishonour, by the death of my seruants? I, I; this is it that greiues mee, this is that wound whereof I bleed. Now, that I am growen a little cooler; now, that that bloud waxeth cold, which yesterday did 〈◊〉 in mee; now that I see the decaying of my house, my want of seruice, the wasting of my patrimony, and the infamie which lights vpon mee by the death of my seruants? what haue I done? How can I possibly containe my selfe? How can I forbeare any longer, but that I should presently expresse my selfe, as a man much wronged? and shew my selfe a proud &amp; speedy reuenger of that open iniurie, which hath been offered mee? O the miserable sweetnes of this most short and transitorie life! who is he so couetous of thy countenance, who will not rather choose to die presently, then to inioy a whole yeere of a shamfull life? and to prorogue it with dishonour, loosing the good report and honourable memory of his noble Ancestours? Especially, sithence that in this world, wee haue not any certaine or limited time: no not so much as a moment or a minute. We are debtours without time: wee stand continually bound to present payment. Why haue I not gone abroad, and made all the inquiry I can, after the secret cause of my open perdition? O thou short delight of the world, how little do thy pleasure last? and how much doe they cost? Repentance should not be bought so deare. O miserable that I am, when shall I recouer so great a losse? what shall I doe? what counsell shall I take? To whom shall I discouer my disgrace? why do I conceale it from the rest of my seruants and kinsefolke? They clip and note my good name in their Councell-house and publike Assemblie, and make mee infamous throughout the whole Kingdome: and they of mine owne house and kindred must not know of it; I will out amongst them. But if I goe out and tell them that I was present, it is too late; if absent, it is too soone. And to prouide mee of friends, antient seruants, and neere àllyes, it will aske some time, as likewise that we be furnish'd with Armes, and other preparations <pb n="158" xml:id="ep000328-086-a"/>of vengeance. O thou cruell Iudge, what ill payment hast thou made mee of that my fathers bread, which so often thou hast eaten? I thought, that by thy fauour I might haue kill'd a thousand men without controlment. O thou falsifier of faith, thou persecutor of the truth, thou man moulded of the baser sort of earth! Truly is the prouerbe verified in thee; that for want of good men thou wast made a Iudge. Thou shouldst haue considered, that thy selfe, and those thou didst put to death, were seruants to my Ancestors and me, and thy fellowes and companions. But when the base to riches doth ascend, he regardeth neither kindred nor friend. Who would haue thought, that thou wouldst haue wrought my vndoing? But there is nothing more hurtfull, then an vnexpected enemy. Why wouldst thou that it should be verified of thee, That that which came out of Aetna, should consume Aetna? And that I hatcht the Crow, which pick't out mine eyes? Thou thy selfe art a publike delinquent, and yet punishest those that were priuate offendors. But I would haue thee to know; that a priuate fault is lesse then a publike, and lesse the inconuenience and danger: At least, according to the Lawes of Athens, which were not written in blood, but doe shew that it is a lesse error, not to condemne a delinquent, then to punish the innocent. O how hard a matter is it, to follow a iust cause before an vniust Iudge! How much more this excesse of my seruants, which was not free from offence! But consider with all spite of all Stoicall Paradoxe, their guilt was not equall, though their sufferings alike. What deseru'd the one, for that which the other did? That onely because he was his companion, thou shouldst doome them both to death? But why doe I talke thus? With whom doe I discourse? Am I in my right wits? What's the matter with thee, Calisto? Dream'st thou, sleep'st thou, or wak'st thou? Stand'st thou on thy feete? Or liest thou all along? Consider with thy selfe that thou art in thy chamber. Doest thou not see that the offendor is not present? With whome doest thou contend? Come againe to thy self; weigh with thy selfe, that the absent were neuer fōnd iust. But if thou wilt be vpright in thy iudgement, thou must keepe an eare for either party. Doest thou not see, that the Law is supposed to be equall vnto all? Remember that Romulus, the first founder of Rome, kill'd his owne brother, because he transgressed the Law. Consider that Torquatus the Romane slew his owne sonne, because he exceeded his Commission. And many other like vnto these did this man doe. Thinke likewise with thy selfe, that if the Iudge were here present, hee would make thee this Answer; that the Principall and the Accessary, the Actor and Consenter, doe merit equall punishment. Howbeit, they were both notwithstanding executed, for that which was committed but by one. And if that other had not his pardon, but receiued a speedy iudgement, it was, because the fault was notorious, and needed no further proofes: as also that they were taken in the very <pb n="159" xml:id="ep000328-086-b"/>Act of murther, and that one of them was found dead of his fall from the window. And it is likewise to be imagined, That that weeping wench which Celestina kept in her house, made them to hasten the more by her wofull and lamentable noyse: And that the Iudge, that he might not make a hurly burly of it, that he might not defame mee, and that he might not stay till the people should presse together, and heare the proclaiming of that great infamy, which could not choose but follow mee, hee did sentence them so early as he did; and the common Hangman, which was the Cryer, could doe no otherwise, that he might cumply with their execution and his owne discharge. All which, if it were done as I conceiue it to bee, I ought rather to rest his debtor, and thinke my selfe bound vnto him the longest day of my life, not as to my fathers sometimes seruant, but as to my true and naturall brother. But put case it were not so; or suppose I should not conster it in the better sence, yet call, Calisto, to mind the great ioy and solace thou hast had, bethinke thy selfe of thy sweete Lady and Mistrisse, and thy whole and sole happines: and since for her sake thou esteemest thy life as nothing for to doe her seruice, thou art not to make any reckoning of the death of others: and the rather, because no sorrow can equall thy receiued pleasure. O my Lady and my life, that I should euer thinke to offend thee in thy absence! And yet in doing as I doe, me thinks, it argues against mee, that I hold in small esteeme that great and singular fauour, which I haue receiued at thy hands. I will now no longer thinke on griefe; I will no longer entertaine friendship with sorrow. O incomparable good! O insatiable contentment! And what could I haue asked more of heauen, in requitall of all my merits in this life (if they be any) then that which I haue already receiued? Why should I not concent my selfe with so great a blessing? which being so, it stands not with reason that I should be vngratefull vnto him, who hath conferr'd vpon mee so great a good: I will therefore acknowledge it, I will not with care craze my vnderstanding, lest that being lost, I should fall from so high and so glorious a possession. I desire no other honour, no other glory, no other riches, no other father nor mother, no other friends nor kinsfolkes. In the day, I will abide in my chamber: In the night, in that sweete Paradise, in that pleasant groue, that greene plot of ground amidst those sweete trees and fresh and delightsome walks. O night of sweet rest and quiet! O that thou hadst made thy returne! O bright shining Phoebus, driue on thy Charriot apace, make haste to thy iourneys end. O comfortable and delightfull starres, breake your wont, and appeare before your time, &amp; out of your wonted and continued course! O dull and slow clocke, I wish to see thee burned in the quickest and loueliest fire that Loue can make. For didst thou but expect that which I doe, when thou strikest twelue, thou wouldst neuer indure to bee tyed to the will of the master that made thee! O yee hyematicall <pb n="160" xml:id="ep000328-087-a"/>and winterly months, which now hide your heads, and liue in darknes and obscurity! Why haste yee not to cut off these tedious daies with your longer nights? Me thinks, it is almost a yeere, since I saw that sweete comfort and most delightfull refreshing of my trauels. But what doe I aske? Why like a foole doe I, out of impatiencie desire that which neuer either was or shall bee? For your naturall courses did neuer learne to wheele away. For to all of them there is an equall course, to all of them one and the selfe-same space and time. Not so much as to life and death, but there is a settled and limited end. The secret motions of the high firmament of heauen, of the Planets and the North-starre, and of the increase and wane of the Moone, all of these are ruled with an equall reyne, all of these are moued with an equall spurre. Heauen, Earth, Sea, Fire, Wind, Heate and Cold. What will it benefit me, that this clocke of yron should strike twelue, if that of heauen doe not hammer with it? And therefore though I rise neuer so soone, it will neuer the sooner be day. But thou my sweete Imagination, thou, who canst onely helpe me in this case, bring thou vnto my Phantasie the vnparaleld presence of that glorious Image. Cause thou to come vnto my eares that sweete Musicke of her words, those her vnwilling hangings off without profit, that her prety, I prythee leaue off; Forbeare, good Sir, if you loue me; Touch me not; Doe not deale so discourteously with me. Out of whose ruddy lips, me thinks, I heare these words still sound, Doe not seek my vndoing: which she would euermore be out withall. Besides, those her amorous imbracements betwixt euery word; that her loosing of her selfe from me; and clypping mee againe; that her flying from mee and her comming to mee; those her sweete sugred Kisses; and that her last salutation wherewith shee tooke her leaue of mee. O with what paine did it issue from her mouth! with what resuscitation of her spirits! with how many teares, which did seeme to be so many round pearles, which did fall without any noyse from her cleare and resplendent eyes! </p>

            <p>You shall know. I am sure (Cousin) you haue already heard tell of the loue betwixt Calisto and that foole Melibea. And you likewise saw how Celestina, at the intercession of Sempronio, so as shee might be paid for her paines, vndertooke the charge of that businesse, and to be the meanes to effect it for him; wherein shee vsed such diligence, and was so carefull in the following of it, that shee drew water at the second spitting. Now when Calisto saw so good and so quicke a dispatch, which he neuer hoped to haue effected, amongst diuers other things, hee gaue this my vnfortunate Aunt a chaine of gold. And as it is the nature of that metall, that the more we drinke thereof, the more wee thirst; shee, when she saw her selfe so rich, appropriated the whole gaine to her selfe, and would not let Sempronio and Parmeno haue their parts, it being before agreed vpon betweene them, that whatsoeuer Calisto gaue her, they should share it alike. Now, they being come home weary one morning from accompaning their Master, with whom they had beene abroad all night, being in great choller and heate, vpon I know not what quarrells and brawles, (as they themselues said) that had betyded them, they demanded part of the chayne of Celestina, for to relieue themselues therewith. Shee stood vpon deniall of any such couenant or promise made betweene them; affirming the whole gaine to be due to her; and discouering withall other petty matters of some secrecie. For, (as it in the Prouerbe) when Gossips brawle, then out goes all. So that they being mightily inraged, on the one side necessity did vrge them, which rents and breaks all the loue in the world; on the other side, the great anger and wearinesse they brought thither with them, which many times workes an alteration in vs. And besides, they saw that they were forsaken in their fayrest hopes, shee breaking her faith and promise with them: So that they knew not in the world what to do; and so continued a great while vpon termes with her, some hard words passing to and fro betweene them. But in the end perceiuing her couetous disposition, and finding that she still perseuered in her denyall, they layd hands vpon their swords, and hackt and hew'd her in a thousand pieces. </p>

            <p>For all loues sake speake softly; they will heare you by and by; let them talke on, they beginne to doat; for this month they haue had no other talke; their minde hath runne on nothing else; it may be their heart tels them of the great loue which I beare to Calisto, as also of that which for this months space hath passed between vs. I know not whether they haue had any inkling of our meeting? or whether they haue ouer-heard vs? nor can I deuise in the world, what should be the reason, why they should be so hot vpon the matter, and more eager for the marrying of mee now, then euer heeretofore: but they shall misse of their purpose; they shall labour it in vaine: for to what vse serues the clapper in the Mil, if the Miller be deafe? Who is he that can remoue me from my glory? Who can withdraw me from my pleasure? Calisto is my Soule, my Life, my Lord; on whom I haue set vp my rest, and in whom I haue placed all my hopes; I know that in him I cannot be deceiued. And since that hee loues me, with what other thing but loue can I requite him? All the debts in the world receiue their payment in a diuers kind; but loue admits no other payment, but loue. I glad my selfe in thinking on him; I delight my selfe in seeing him; and reioyce my selfe in hearing him. Let him doe with mee what he will, and dispose of me at his pleasure; if he will goe to Sea, I will goe with him; if hee will round the world, I will along with him; if he will sell mee for a slaue in the enemies Countrey, I will not resist his desire. Let my Parents let me inioy him, if they meane to inioy me; let them not settle their thoughts vpon these vanities, nor thinke no more vpon those their marriages. For, it is better to be well belou'd, then ill married; and a good friend is better then a bad husband. Let them suffer mee to inioy the pleasure of my youth, if they minde to iniov any quietnesse in their age; if not, they will but prepare destruction for me, and for themselues a Sepulchre. I grieue for nothing more, then for the time that I haue lost in not inioying him any sooner, and that hee did not know me, as soone as he was knowne vnto me. I will no husband; I will not fully the knots of matrimony, nor treade against the matrimoniall steppes of another man; nor walke in the way of wedlocke with a stranger, as I finde many haue done, in those ancient bookes which I haue read, which were farre more discreete, and wiser then my selfe; and more noble in their estate and Linage, whereof some were held among the heathens for goddesses: as was Venus, the <pb n="171" xml:id="ep000328-092-b"/>mother of Eneas and of Cupid, the god of loue, who being married, broke her plighted troth of wedlocke: as likewise diuers others, who were inflamed with a greater fire, and did commit most nefarious and incestuous errors: as Myrrha, with her father; Semyramis with her sonne; Canace with her brother; others also in a more cruell and beastly fashion, did transgresse the Law of Nature: as Pasiphae, the wife of King Minos, with a Bull: and these were Queenes and great Ladies, vnder whose faults (considering the foulnesse of them) mine may passe as reasonable, without note of shame, or dishonesty. My loue was grounded vpon a good and iust cause, and a farre more lawfull ground. I was wooed and sued vnto, and captiuated by Calisto's good deserts; being thereunto solicited by that subtil and cunning Mistris in her Art, Dame Celestina, who aduentured her selfe in many a dangerous Visit, before that euer I would yeeld my selfe true prisoner to his loue. And now for this month, and more (as you your selfe haue seene) hee hath not failed, no, not so much as one night, but hath still scaled our garden walls, as if hee had come to the scaling of a fort; and many times hath beene repulsed, and assaulted it in vaine, being driuen to withdraw his siege. And yet for all this, hee continued more constant and resolute still, and neuer would giue ouer, as one that thought his labour to be well bestowed. For my sake, his seruants haue beene slaine; for my sake, hee hath wasted and consumed his substance; for my sake hee hath fayned absence with all his friends in the City; and all day long hee hath had the patience to remaine close prisoner in his owne house, and onely vpon hope (wherein hee counted himselfe happy) to see mee in the night: Farre, farre therefore from mee be all ingratitude; farre be all flattery and dissimulation towards so true and faithfull a Louer; for I regard (in my regard to him) neyther husband, father, nor kindred; for in losing my Calisto, I lose my life, which life of mine doth therefore please me, because it pleaseth him; which I desire no longer to inioy, then he shall ioy in it. </p>

            <p>I doe my selfe wrong, to mourne thus. Few doe visit my house; few doe passe this way. I can heare no musicke nor stirring betimes in the morning; I haue no amorous ditties sung by my Louers at my windowe; there are no frayes, nor quarrels before my doore; they do not cut and slash one another anights for my sake, as they were wont to doe: and that which most of all grieues me, is, that I see neither penny nor farthing, nor any other present to come within my doores. But for this, can I blame no body but my selfe; my selfe only is in fault; for had I followed the counsell of her, who is my true and faithfull Sister, when as I brought her the other day the newes of this sad and heauy Accident, which hath brought all this penury vpon mee, I had not liu'd alone mur'd vp betweene two walls; nor others loathed to haue come, and seene mee. The diuell (I thinke) makes mee to mourne thus for him, who, had I beene dead, would scarce, perhaps, haue shed one teare for mee. Now I dare boldly say, that Areusa told mee truth. Sister (quoth shee) neuer conceiue, nor shew more sorrow for the misfortune, or death of another, then he would haue done for thee. Sempronio, had I beene dead, would haue beene ne'r a whit the lesse merry, he would not haue wronged-his delights, nor abridged his pleasures. And why then like a foole should I grieue and vexe my selfe, for one that is dead and gone, and hath lost his head by order of Law? And what can I tell, whether being a cholericke and hastly-hayrebraind fellow as he was, he might haue killed mee too, as well as he did that old woman, whom I reckoned of as of mine owne mother? I will therefore by all meanes follow Arcusa's counsell, who knowes more of the world then I doe; and goe new and then to visit her, that I may learne something from her, how I may liue another day. O what a sweet participation will this be? what a delightfull conuersation? I see it is not said in vaine; That of more worth is one day of a wise man, then the whole life of a foole; I will therefore put off my mourning weedes, lay aside my sorrow, dismisse my teares, which haue hitherto bin so ready to offer their seruice to my eyes. But sithence that it is the very first office that we doe, as soone as we are borne, to come crying into the world; I nothing wonder that it is so easie to beginne to cry; and so hard to leaue off. But this may teach one wit, by seeing the hurt it does to the eyes; by seeing that good cloathes and neat dressings, make a woman seeme ●●ire and handsome, though shee be nothing so, nor so; making her of old, young; and of young, younger. Your colour'd paintings, <pb n="174" xml:id="ep000328-094-a"/>and your Cerusses which giue women such a pure white &amp; red, what are they, but a slimy clinging thing, a kind of bird-lime, wherewith men are taken and insnared? Come then thou my glasse, come hither againe vnto me; and thou to my Antimonium; for I haue too much already wronged my eyes, &amp; almost marr'd my face, with my blubbring &amp; weeping. I will on with my white Vailes, my wrought Gorgets, my gay Garments, my more pleasing Attire, and such other apparell, as shall speake pleasure. I will presently prouide some Lye for my hayre, which now through neglect, hath lost it's bright burnisht hiew. And this being done, I will count my Hens, I will make vp my bed: for it glads a womans heart, to see things neat and handsome about her. I will haue all well swept and made cleane before my doore, and the streete that buts vpon it, sprinkled with water, as well to keepe it coole, as to lay the dust; to the end, that they who passe by, may plainely thereby perceiue, that I haue banisht all griefe, and shaken hands with sorrow. But first of all, I will goe and visit my Cousin, to know whether Sosia haue beene with her or no? And what good shee hath done vpon him? For I haue not seene him; since I told him that Areusa would faine speake with him. I pray Ioue, I may finde her all alone; for shee is seldome any more without Gallants, then a good Tauerne is without drunkards; the doore is shut, there should be no body within; I will knocke, and see. Tha, tha, tha. </p>

            <p>My Loue, thou know'st how dearely I lou'd Parmeno. And as it is in the Prouerbe, Hee that loues Beltram, loues any thing that is his; all his friends were alwaies welcome vnto mee; his good seruice to his Master did as much please mee, as it pleased himselfe. When hee saw any harme towards Calisto, hee did study to preuent it. Now as all this is true, so thought I it good to accquaint thee with it. First then did I send for thee, that I might giue thee to vnderstand how much I loue thee; &amp; how much I ioy and euer shall, in this thy visiting mee; nor shalt thou lose any thing by it, if I can helpe it, but rather turne to thy profit and benefit. Secondly, since that I haue setled my eyes, my loue and affection on thee, that I may aduise thee to take heede how thou commest in danger; and besides, to admonish thee, that thou doe not discouer thy secrets to any: For you see what ill befell Parmeno and Sempronio, by imparting things of secrecy vnto Celestina; for I would not willingly see thee dye in such an ill fashion, as your fellow and companion did; it is enough for mee that I haue bewayled one of you already, and therefore I would haue you to know, that there came one vnto mee, and told me that you had discouered vnto him the loue, that is betwixt Calisto and Melibea; and how hee wanne her; and how you your selfe night by night went along with him; and many other things which now I cannot call to minde. Take heede (friend) for not to keepe a secret, is proper onely vnto women, yet not vnto all, but such as are fooles and children. Take heede (I say) for heere-hence great hurt may come vnto you: and to this end did Nature giue you two eares, and two eyes, and but one tongue; to the end that what you see and heare, should be double to that you speake. Take heede, and doe not thinke your friend will keepe your secret, when you your selfe cannot keepe it; when therefore thou art to goe with thy Master, Calisto, to that Ladies house, make no noyse, lest you be heard; for some haue told me, that euery night you keepe a coyle, and cannot containe your selues, as men transported and ouer-ioyed. </p>

I will faine my selfe sicke: But what will that profit me? for then they will be at me againe when I am well. Againe, if I shall tell them that I haue beene there, and that I forced them to flye, they will aske mee who they were? how many in number, and in what place I buckled with them? and what apparell they wore? and by what markes I knew them to be such and such? and the diuell awhit shall I be able to tell them: And then all the fat is in the fire. What counsell then shall I take, that may cumply with mine own safety, and their desire? I will send for lame Thraso, and his companions, and tell them, that because this night I shall be otherwise imployed, they would goe and make a clattering with their Swords and Bucklers in manner of a fray, for to feare, and affright certaine young men, whom they shall finde in such a place, which seruice was faithfully recommended vnto mee to execute. This I know is a sure course, and no other hurt can follow thereupon, saue to make them fly, and so get them home to bed. </p>

Vpon whom Sosia sallies forth. Now Calisto hearing from the garden where hee remained with Melibea, the clashing and clattering which they made, would needes goe foorth amongst them. Which issuing forth was the cause <pb n="184" xml:id="ep000328-099-a"/>that his daies were finished; for this is the recompence which such Louers receiue.

            <p>Softly, that wee may not be heard. As wee goe from hence to Pleberio's garden, I will tell thee all (brother Tristan) that passed this day, betwixt Areusa, and my selfe, taking my selfe now to be the happiest man in the world. Thou shalt vnderstand then, that vpon the good report which shee heard of mee, shee fell extremely in loue with mee, and sent me word by Elicia, that I would doe her the kindnesse, as to come and speake with her. But omitting many other speaches of good counsell, which then past betweene vs, shee made present shew vnto mee, that shee was now as much mine, as euer shee was Parmeno's. Shee requested mee, that I would continually come and visit her; and that she did not doubt, but that shee should long inioy my loue. And I sweare to thee (brother) by that dangerous way wherein wee walke, and as euer any good may heereafter befall mee, that twice or thrice it was as much as euer I could doe for my life, to forbeare from boording her; but that very shame did hinder mee, seeing her so faire, and so well clad, and my selfe in an old Mouse-eaten cloake: still as shee moued and aduanced her selfe, shee did breathe forth a most sweet and redolent odour of Muske; and I neuer stirr'd, or heau'd my body, but I sent forth a most ranke sent of that horse-dung, which had got within my shooes: Shee had a hand as white as snow, and euer and anon, as she pull'd off her gloue, thou wouldst haue thought, that she had scattered flowres of Orenges about the roome; so that as well in regard of this, as also because at that time shee was somewhat busie, I was content to deferre my boldnesse till another day: as likewise because all things at the first sight are not so tractable; for the more they are communicated, the better are they vnderstood in their participation. </p>

            <p>Friend Sosia, another more ripe and mature braine, and better experimented in matters of the world then mine is, were very necessary to be your aduiser in this businesse; yet as farreforth as my tender age, and the meanes of my naturall parts and wit shall be able to reach vnto; I will tell you what I thinke. This woman, (as you told me your selfe) is a known and a noted whore; and therefore whatsoeuer hath past betweene you, flatter not your selfe, but rather beleeue, that her words doe not want deceit. Her offers, I <pb n="185" xml:id="ep000328-099-b"/>perswade mee were false, though I know not to what end she made them. If shee loue thee, because thou art a Gentleman; how many better then thy selfe hath she reiected? If because thou art rich; she knowes well enough that thou hast no other dust, then that which clings to the Curry-combe. If because thou art nobly descended, and of high Linage; she knowes thy name is Sosia, and so was thy fathers; and that he was borne and bred in a poore little Hamlet, getting his liuing by following the Plough-tayle, and breaking Clods of earth, for which thy selfe art more fit then to make a Louer. Be wise, Sosia, and consider with thy selfe, if she doe not goe a birding, to see if she could get out of thee, the secrecy of this walke, whereby to worke some heart-burning, and breed no good bloud betwixt Calisto and Pleberio, out of that enuy which she beares to Melibea's pleasure. Beware (I say:) for Enuy (I tell you) is an incurable infirmity, when it is once settled: shee is a guest that is alwaies more troublesome, then thankfull for her lodging, and is neuer merry, but at other folkes miseries; nor euer laughes, but at a shrewd turne. Now then, if this be so: O! how this wicked woman will deceiue thee with her smooth and subtill words, whereof, such as she are neuer to seeke, but haue them still ready in the deck, and more perfect then their Pater noster? With this venemous vice, shee will not sticke to damne her soule, so as shee may please her appetite; shee would faine turne all things topsituruy, and set men together by the eares, and onely for to content her damnable desire. O Ruffianly Strumpet! O mankind Queane! With what white bread hath shee giuen thee crooked pinnes, to choake thee? Shee cares not now shee sells and barters her body, so as shee may truck and exchange it for strife and contention. Heare mee, Sosia, and if thou doest as thou may'st presume vpon it, that it is as I tell thee, deale (if thou wilt be aduised by mee) as doubly with her; for he that deceiues the deceiuer, you know what I meane: and if the Foxe be crafty, more crafty is hee that catches him. I would haue thee make a counter-mine against these her wicked, and diuellish imaginations. Set vp scaling ladders to meete with her lewdnesse; and then cry quittance with her, when shee thinkes her selfe most safe and secure; and laugh at her afterwards, when thou art by thy selfe all alone in thy stable: the bay horse thinkes one thing, and hee that saddles him, another. </p>

            <p>They haue all of them left me. I am now alone by my selfe, and no body with mee. The manner of my death falls fit and pat to my minde; it is some ease vnto mee, that I and my beloued Calisto shall so soone meet againe. I will shut and make fast the dore, that no body may come vp to hinder my death, nor disturbe my departure, nor to stop me in my iourney, wherin I purpose to poast vnto him; not doubting, but to visit him as well this very day, as he did mee this last night. All things fadge aright, and haue falne out as luckily, as I could wish it; I shall now haue time and leysure enough, to recount to my father Pleberio, the cause of this my short and sudden end. I confesse, I shall much wrong his siluer hayres, and offer much iniury to his elder yeers; I shall work great wo vnto him by this my errour; I shall leaue him in great heauinesse and desolation all the daies of his life: But admit my death will be the death of my dearest parents, and put case, that the shortning of my daies, will be the shortning of theirs; who doth not know, but that others haue beene more cruell to their parents then I am? Prusias, King of Bythinia, without any cause, not induring that paine, which I doe, slew his owne father Ptolomy, King of Egypt, slew both father and mother, and brother and wife, and all for the loue of his Mistris. Orestes kil'd his mother, Clytemnestar, and that cruell Emperour Nero, onely for the fulfilling of his pleasure, murdred his owne mother. These, and such as they, are worthy of blame. These are true Parricides; not I; who with mine owne punishment, and with mine owne death, purge away the guilt, which otherwise, they might moe iustly lay vpon mee for their deaths. There haue beene others, <pb n="294" xml:id="ep000328-104-a"/>far more cruell, who haue slaine their own children, and their owne brothers, in comparison of whose errours, mine is as nothing; at least nothing so great. Philip, King of Macedon; Herod, King of Iuryne; Constantine, Emperour of Rome; Laodice, Queene of Cappadocea; and Medea the Sorceresse; all these slew their owne sonnes and dearest children, and that without any reason or iust cause, preseruing their owne persons still in safety. To conclude, that great cruelty of Phraates, King of the Parthians, occurres to my remembrance, who, because hee would haue no successour behinde him, murdred Orodes, his aged father, as also his onely sonne, besides some thirty more of his brethren. These were delicts worthy blame indeed; because they keeping their owne persons free from perill, butchered their Ancestours, their successours, and their brethren. True it is, that though all this be so, yet are we not to imitate them in those things wherein they did amisse; but it is not in my power to doe otherwise. And thou great Gouernour of the heauens, who art witnesse to my words, thou see'st the small power that I haue ouer my passion; thou seest how my liberty is captiuated, and how my senses are taken with that powerfull loue of that late deceased Gentleman, who hath depriued mee of that loue, which I beare to my liuing parents. </p>

Now, by and by shalt thou be suddenly wounded; thy heart shall presently be prickt with griefe, and shall bleede abundantly, to see the death of thy onely daughter. My end drawes neere; at hand is my, rest, and thy passion▪ my ease, and thy paine; my houre of keeping company and thy time of solitarinesse. You shall not need (my most honoured father) to seeke out any instruments of musick to asswage my sorrow; nor vse any other sound, saue the sound of bels, for to ring my knell, and bring my body to the graue. And, if thou canst harken vnto mee for teares, if thine eyes will giue thine cares leaue to heare, thou shalt heare the desperate cause of this my forced, yet ioyfull departure; see thou neyther speake nor weepe; interrupt mee not, eyther with teares or words, vnlesse thou mean'st more heereafter to be tormented, in not knowing why I doe kill my selfe, then thou art now sorrowfull to see my death. Neither aske, nor answer mee any thing; nor question me any further, then what of mine owne accord I shall willingly tell thee; for when the heart is surcharged with sorrow, the eare is deafe to good counsell; and at such a time, good and wholsome words rather incense, then allay rage. Heare (my aged father) the last words that euer I shall speake vnto you. And if you entertaine them, as I hope you will, you will rather excuse, then condemne my errour. I am sure, you both well <pb n="195" xml:id="ep000328-104-b"/>perceiue and heare that most sad and doleful lamentation, which is made thorowout all this City; I am sure you heare this great noyse and ringing of bells, the skriking and cryings out of all sorts of people, this howling, and barking of dogges, this noyse and clattering of Armour. Of all this, haue I beene the cause; I, euen this very day, haue clothed the greater part of the Knights, and Gentlemen of this City in mourning. I, euen this very day, haue left many seruants orphaned, and quite destitute of a Master. I haue beene the cause, that many a poore soule hath now lost it's almes and reliefe. I haue beene the occasion, that the dead should haue the company of the most complete Gentleman, for his good graces and qualities that euer was borne. I haue beene the occasion, that the liuing haue lost the onely Patterne and Paragon of courtesie, of gallant inuentions, of witty deuices, of neatnesse and decency in his cloathes, of speech, of gate, of kindnesse, and of vertue. I haue beene the occasion, that the earth doth now inioy the most noble body, and the freshest flowre of youth, that euer was created in this age of ours. And because you may stand amazed and astonished at the sound of these my vnusuall and vnaccustomed crimes; I will open the businesse, and make this matter appeare more cleare vnto you. </p>
            <p>It is now (deare father) many dayes since that a Gentleman called Calisto, whom you well knew, as likewise his Ancestors, and noble Linage, did languish and pine away for my loue.

So great was his loue-torment, and so little both place and opportunity to speake with me, that he was driuen to discouer his passion to a crafty and subtill woman, named Celestina, which Celestina, comming as a suiter vnto mee in his behalfe, drew my secret loue from forth my bosome, and made mee to manifest that vnto her, which I concealed from mine own mother; she found the meanes to win me to her will; shee made the match betweene vs; shee plotted how his desire and mine should take effect. And if hee dearely loued me, I was not therein deceiued; shee made vp that sad conclusion of that sweete and vnfortunate execution of his will; and thus being ouer-come with the loue of Calisto, I gaue him entrance into your house; hee scaled your walls with ladders, and brake into your garden; brake my chaste purpose, by taking from mee the flowre of my Virginity. And thus almost this moneth haue wee liu'd in this delightfull errour of loue. And as he came this lastnight vnto mee, as hee was wont to doe, e'en iust about the time that he should haue returned home (as ill fortune would haue it, who in the mutability of her nature, ordereth and disposeth all things, according to her disordered custome) the walls being high, the night darke, the ladder light and weake, his seruants that brought it, vnacquainted with that kinde of seruice, hee going downe somewhat hastily to see a fray, which he heard in the streete betweene his seruants and some others that then passed by, being in choller, making more haste <pb n="196" xml:id="ep000328-105-a"/>then good speed, thinking he should neuer come soone enough, not eying well his steps, he sets his foot quite besides the rounds, and so fell downe, and with that wofull and vnfortunate fall, hee pitcht vpon his head, and had his braines beaten out, and dasht in pieces against the stones and pauement of the streete. Thus did the destinies cut off his thred; thus cut off his life without confession; cut off my hope; cut off my glory; cut off my company. Things therefore being thus; tell me (father) What cruelty were it in me, he dying disbrained, that I should liue pained all the daies of my life? His death inuiteth mine; inuiteth? nay, inforceth mee, that it be speedily effected, and without delay; it teacheth mee, that I should also fall headlong down, that I may imitate him in all things. It shall not be said of mee, that those that are dead and gone, are soone forgotten. And therefore I will seeke to content him in my death, since I had not time to giue him content in my life. O my Loue, and deare Lord, Calisto, expect mee, for now I come. But stay a little, though thou dost expect mee; and be not angry, I prythee, that I delay thee, being that I am now paying my last debt, and giuing it my finall account to my aged father, to whom I owe much more. O my best beloued father, I beseech you, if euer you did loue mee in this painefull forepassed life, that we may both be interred in one Tombe, and both our Obsequies be solemnized together. I would faine speake some words of comfort vnto you, before this my gladsome and well-pleasing end, gathered and collected out of those ancient bookes, which for the bettering of my wit and vnderstanding, you willed me to reade, were it not that my memory failes me, being troubled and disquieted with the losse and death of my Loue: as also because I see your ill indured teares trickle so fast downe your wrinckled cheekes. Recommend mee to my most deare and best-beloued mother; and doe you informe her at large of the dolefull occasion of my death. I am glad with all my heart, that shee is not heere present with you; for her sight would but increase my sorrow. Take (aged father) the gifts of old age; for in large daies, large griefes are to be endured. Receiue the pledge and earnest of thy reuerend age; receiue it at the hands of thy beloued daughter. I sorrow much for my selfe, more for you, but most for my aged mother: and so I recommend me to you both, and both of you vnto your more happinesse, to whom I offer vp my soule; leauing the care to you, to couer this body that is now comming downe vnto you. </p>

            <p>Why Pleberio? my Lord! what's the matter? why doe you weepe and snobbe? and take on in such extreme and violent manner? I haue lyen euer since in a dead swound, so was I ouercome with griefe, when I heard that our daughter was so ill. And now hearing your pittifull lamentations, your loude cryings, your vnaccustomed complaints, your mournings and great anguish, they haue so pierced my very bowels, made so quicke a passage to my heart, and haue so quickned and reuiued my troubled and benummed senses, that I haue now put away the griefe, which I entertained: thus one griefe driues out another; and sorrow expelleth sorrow. Tell mee the cause of your complaint; Why doe you curse your honorable old age? Why do you desire death? Why doe you teare your milke-white hayres vp by the roates? Why doe you scratch, and rend your reuerend face? Is any ill befalne Melibea? For I pray you tell mee; for if shee be not well, I cannot liue. </p>

            <p>Out alas! Ay mee; (my most noble wife.) Our solace is in the suds; our ioy is turn'd into annoy; all our conceiued hopes are vtterly lost; all our happinesse is quite ouerthrowne; let vs now no longer desire to liue. And because vnexpected sorrowes leaue a greater impression of griefe; and because they may bring <pb n="198" xml:id="ep000328-106-a"/>thee the sooner to thy graue; as also, that I may not alone by my selfe bewayle that heauy losse which belongs to vs both; looke out and behold her, whom thou broughtst forth, and I begot, dash't and broken all to pieces. The cause I vnderstood from her selfe, but layd open more at large, by this her sadde and sorrowfull seruant. Helpe to lament these our latter daies, which are now growing to an end. O yee good people, who come to behold my sorrowes, and you Gentlemen, my louing friends, doe you also assist to bewayle my misery! O my daughter! and my onely good! it were cruelty in mee, that I should out-liue thee. My threescore yeeres were fitter for the graue, then thy twenty; but the order of my dying was altred by that extremity of griefe, which did hasten thy end. O yee my boary hayres, growne foorth to no other end, saue sorrow; it would better haue suted with you, to haue beene buryed in the earth, then with these golden tresses which lye heere before mee. Too too many are the dayes that I haue yet to liue; I will complaine and cry out against death; I will accuse him of delay; how long will hee suffer mee to remaine heere after thee! Let my life now leaue mee, since I must leaue thy sweet company. O my deare wife, rise vp from her, and if any life be left in thee, spend that little with mee in teares and lamentations, in sobbes, and in sighes; but in case thy soule resteth now with hers; if out of very griefe, thou hast left this life, why wouldst thou lay this heauy burthen on mee? why let mee remaine heere alone, and haue no body to help me in the vnsheathing of my sorrowes? In this, yee women haue a great aduantage of vs that are men; for some violent griefe can make you goe out of the world without any paine; or at least cast you into a swound, which is some ease to your sorrowes. O the hard heart of a father, why dost thou not burst with griefe? why doe not your heart-strings crack in sunder, to see thy selfe bereau'd of thy beloued heyre? For whom didst thou build these Turrets? For whom got I honours? For whom planted trees? For whom built ships? O hard-hearted earth, why dost thou beare me any longer? Where shall my disconsolate old age finde any resting place? O variable fortune, and full of change, thou Ministresse, and high Stewardesse of all temporall happinesse; Why didst thou not execute thy cruell anger vpon mee? Why didst thou not ouerwhelme him with thy mutable waues, who professes himselfe to be thy subiect? Why didst thou not rob mee of my patrimony? Why didst thou not set fire on my house? Why didst thou not lay waste mine inheritance? Why didst thou not strip mee of my great reuenewes? What is't I would not thou shouldst haue done, so as thou hadst left mee that flourishing young plant, ouer which thou ought'st not to haue had such power? Thou might'st, O fortune (fluctuant, and fluent as thou art) haue giuen me a sorrowfull youth, and a mirthfull age; neyther haue therein peruerted order. Better could I haue borne thy blowe, better indured thy persecutions, in that my more strong, and Oaky <pb n="199" xml:id="ep000328-106-b"/>age, then in this my weake and feeble declining. O life fulfill'd with griefe, and accompanied with nought but misery! O world, world! much haue men spoken of thee, much haue men writ concerning thy deceits; and much haue I heard my selfe: And mine owne wofull experience is able to say something of thee, as one who haue bin in the vnfortunate fayre, and haue often bought and sold with thee, but neuer had any thing that succeeded happily with mee. As one who many a time heeretofore, euen to this present houre, haue silenced thy false properties, and all because I would not purchase thy displeasure, and pull thy hatred vpon mee: and that thou shouldst not vntimely plucke this flowre from me, which this day thou hast cropt by the mightinesse of thy power. And therefore now will I goe without feare, like one that hath nothing to lose; or as one to whom thy company is now odious and troublesome; or like a poore traueller, who fearelesse of theeues, goes singing on his way. I thought in my more tender yeeres, that both thou and thy actions were gouerned by order, and ruled by reason: But now I see thou art Pro and Con; there is no certainty in thy calmes: thou seemest now vnto me to be a Labyrinth of errours; a fearefull wildernesse; an habitation of wilde Beasts; a Dance full of changes; a Fen full of mire, and dirt; a Country full of thornes; a steepe and craggy mountaine, a field full of stones; a meddow full of Snakes and Serpents; a pleasant garden to looke to, but without any fruite; a fountaine of cares, a riuer of teares, a sea of miseries; trouble without profit; a sweet poyson, a vaine hope, a false ioy, and a true sorrow. O thou false world! thou dost cast before vs the baytes of thy best delights, and when we haue swallowed them, they seeming sauoury vnto vs, then doest thou shew vs the hooke that must choake vs. Nor can we auoyd it, because together with vs, thou dost captiuate our wills: Thou promisest mountaines, but performest Mole-hils: and then thou dost cast vs off, that wee may not put thee in minde of making good thy vaine promises. We runne thorow the spacious fields of thy ranke vices, retchlesly, and with a loose reyne; and then doest thou discouer thy ambushes vnto vs, when thou seest there is no way forvs to retreat. Many haue forsaken thee, fearing thy sudden forsaking of them. And well may they stile themselues happy, when they shall see, how well thou hast rewarded this poore heauy sorrowfull old man, for his long seruice. Thou dost put out our eyes, and then to make vs amends, thou anointest the place with oyle: thou breakest our head, and giuest vs a plaister; after thou hast done vs a great deale of harme, thou giuest vs a poore cold comfort; thou dost hurt vnto all, that no man may boast, that others haue not their crosses as well as wee; telling them, that it is some ease to the miserable, to haue companions in their misery. But I alas, disconsolate old man stand all alone. I am singuler in my sorrowes; I am grieued, and haue no equall companion of my griefe. No mans misfortune is like vnto mine; though I reuolue in my <pb n="200" xml:id="ep000328-107-a"/>troubled memory, persons both present and past, I cannot instance in the like. If I shall seeke to comfort my selfe with the seuerity and patience of Paulus Aemilius, who hauing lost two sonnes in seuen daies, bore this brunt of fortune with so vndaunted a courage, that the people of Rome had rather neede to be comforted by him, then he by them; yet cannot this satisfie mee, for hee had two more remaining that were his adopted sonnes. What companion then will they allot me of my misery? Pericles, that braue Athenian Captaine? or valiant Xenophon? Tush, they lost sonnes indeed, but their sonnes dyed out of their sight, hauing lost their liues abroad in forraine Countries, far from home; so that it was not much for the one, not to change countenance, but to take it cheerefully: nor for the other to answer the messenger, who brought him the ill tydings of his sonnes deaths, that he should receiue no punishment, because himselfe had receiued no griefe; for all this is farre differing from mine; lesse canst thou say (thou world replenished with euill) that Anaxagoras, and I, were alike in our losse; that wee were equall in our griefes: and that I should say of my dead daughter, as he did of his onely sonne, when he said; Being that I was mortall, I knew, that he whom I had begot was to die. For my Melibea, willingly, and out of her owne election, killed her selfe before mine eyes, inforced thereunto through the extreme passion of her loue, so great was her torment; whereas his sonne was slaine in battell, in a iust and lawfull warre. O incomparable losse; O most wretched and sorrowfull old man that I am! who the more I seeke after comfort, the lesse reason doe I finde for my comfort; for much more miserable doe I finde my misfortune, and doe not so much grieue at her death, as I doe lament the manner of her death. Now shall I lose together with thee (most vnhappy daughter) those feares, which were daily wont to affright mee. Onely thy death is that which makes mee secure of all suspitions and iealousies. What shall I doe, when I shall come into thy chamber, and thy withdrawing roome, and shall finde it solitary and empty? What shall I doe, when as I shall call thee, and thou shalt not answer me? Who is he that can supply that want which thou hast caused? Who can stop vp that great breach in my heart which thou hast made? Neuer any man did lose that which I haue lost this day. Thogh in some sort, that great fortitude of Lambas de Auria, Duke of Genoa, seemeth to sute with my present estate and condition, who seeing his sonne was wounded to death, tooke him and threw him with his owne armes foorth of the shippe into the sea. But such kinde of deaths as these, though they take away life, yet they giue reputation; and many times, men are inforced to vndergoe such actions, for to cumply with their honour, and get themselues fame and renowne. But what did inforce my daughter to dye, but onely the strong force of loue? What remedy now, (thou flattering world) wilt thou affoord my wearisome age? How wouldst thou haue me to rely vpon thee, I knowing thy falsehoods, <pb n="201" xml:id="ep000328-107-b"/>thy gins, thy snares, and thy nets, wherein thou intrap'st and takest our weake and feeble wills? Tell me, what hast thou done with my daughter? where hast thou bestow'd her? who shall accompany my disaccompanied habitation? who shall cherish me in mine old age? who with gentle vsage shall cocker my decaying yeeres? O Loue, Loue, I did not thinke thou hadst had the power to kill thy subiects! I was wounded by thee in my youth: did passe thorow the midst of thy flames. Why didst thou let me scape? Was it that thou might'st pay me home (for my flying from thee then) in mine old age? I had well thought, that I had bin freed from thy snares, when I once began to growe towards forty; and when I rested contented with my wedded consort, and when I saw I had that fruit, which this day thou hast cut down, I did not dreame that thou would'st in the children haue taken vengeance of the parents; and I know not whether thou woundest with the sword, or burnest with fire. Thou leauest our clothes whole, and yet most cruelly woundest our hearts; thou makest that which is foule, to seeme fayre and beautifull vnto vs. Who gaue thee so great a power? who gaue thee that name which so ill befitteth thee? If thou wert Loue, thou wouldst loue thy seruants; and if thou didst loue them, thou wouldst not punish them as thou dost. If to be thy fellow, were to liue merrily, so many would not kill themselues, as my daughter now hath, &amp; infinit of vs. What end haue thy seruants and their Ministers had? as also that false Bawd, Celestina, who dy'd by the hands of the faithfullest companions, that euer she lighted vpon in her life, for their true performance in this thy venomous &amp; impoisoned seruice? They lost their heads; Calisto, he brake his necke; and my daughter, to imitate him, submitted her selfe to the selfe-same death. And of all this thou wast the cause; they gaue thee a sweete name; but thy deedes are exceeding sowre: thou dost not giue equall rewards; and that Law is vniust, which is not equall alike vnto all. Thy voyce promiseth pleasure, but thy actions proclaime paine; happy are they who haue not knowne thee, or knowing thee, haue not cared for thee. Some ledde with, I know not what error, haue not stickt to call thee a god; But I would haue such fooles as these to consider with themselues, it sauors not of a Deity, to murder or destroy those that serue and follow him. O thou enemy to all reason! To those that serue thee least, thou giuest thy greatest rewards, vntill thou hast brought them at last into this thy troublesome dance. Thou art an enemy to thy friends, and a friend to thy enemies; and all this is, because thou dost not gouerne thy selfe according to order &amp; reason. They paint thee blind, poore, and young; they put a Bowe into thy hand, wherein thou drawest, and shootest at random; but more blind are they that serue thee. For they neuer taste or see the vnsauory &amp; distastful recompence, which they receiue by thy seruice; thy fire is of hot burning lightning, which scorches vnto death, yet leaues no impression or print of any wound at all. The sticks which thy flames consume, are the soules <pb n="202" xml:id="ep000328-108-a"/>and liues of humane creatures, which are so infinit, and so numberlesse, that it scarce accurreth vnto me, with whom I should first begin, not only of Christians, but of Gentiles &amp; of Iewes; and all forsooth in requitall of their good seruices. What shall I speak of that Macias of our times; and how by louing, he came to his end? Of whose sad and wofull death, thou wast the sole cause. What seruice did Paris do thee? What Helena? What Clytemnestra? What Aegisthus? All the world knowes how it went with them. How well likewise didst thou requite Sapho, Ariadne, and Leander, and many other besides, whom I willingly silence, because I haue enough to do in the repetition of mine own misery? I complaine me of the world, because I was bred vp in it; for had not the world giuen me life, I had not therein begot Melibea; not being begot, shee had not beene borne; not being borne, I had not lou'd her; and not louing her, I should not haue mourned, as now I do, in this my latter and vncomfortable old age! O my good companion! O my bruised daughter, bruised euen all to pieces! Why wouldst thou not suffer me to diuert thy death? why wouldst thou not take pitty of thy kinde and louing mother? why didst thou shew thy selfe so cruell against thy aged father? why hast thou left me thus in sorrow? why hast thou left me comfortlesse, and all alone, in hâc lachrimarum valle, in this vaile of teares, and shadow of death? </p>
