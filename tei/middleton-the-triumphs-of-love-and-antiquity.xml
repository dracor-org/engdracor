        <p>IF Forreine Nations haue beene struck with admiration at the Forme, State, and Splendour of some yearly Triumphs, wherein. Art hath bene but weakely imitated, and most beggerly worded: there is faire hope that things where Inuention flourishes, Cleare Art and her gracefull proprieties, should receiue fauour and encouragement from the content of the Spectator, which (next to the seruice of his Honour, and honourable Society) is the principall Reward it looks for; and not despairing of that common fauor (which is often cast vpon the vndeseruer, through the distresse and miserie of Iudgement) this takes delight to present it selfe. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000197-004-a"/>
        <p>And first to beginne early with the Loue of the Citie to his Lordship, let mee draw your attentions to his Honours entertainment vpon the water, where Expectation big with the Ioy of the Day, but beholding to free Loue for Language and expression, thus salutes the Great Maister of the Day and Triumph. </p>
