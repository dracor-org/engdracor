        <p>THe Kings Majesties Masque being performed, the Queene commanded Inigo Iones Surveyor of her Majesties works, to make a new subject of a Masque for her selfe, that with high and hearty invention, might give occasion for variety of Scenes, strange aparitions, Songs, Musick and dancing of severall kinds; from whence doth result the true pleasure peculiar to our English Masques, which by strangers and travellers of judgement, are held to be as noble and ingenious, as those of any other nations: This being suddainly done and shewed her Majestie, and shee approving it, the worke was set in hand, and with all celerity performed in shorter time, than any thing here hath beene done in this kind. </p>
        <p>The invention consisting of darknesse and light, the night presents the first Antimasques and sleepe with his three principall children, the Antimasques of dreams: The subject of the maine Masque of light, was thus introduc'd. The Muses being long since drawne out of Greece by the fierce Thratians, their groves withered and all their springs dryed up, and out of Italy by the barbarous Goths and vandals, they wandred here and there indecently without their ornaments <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000134-003-a"/>and instruments: The Arch-Flamines and Flamines their Prophetick Priests being constrained either to live in disguises, or hide their heads in caves, and in some places, whensoever they began to appeare, they were together with peace driven out by warre, and in the more civiliz'd parts, where they hop'd to have taken some rest, envy and avarice by clipping the wings of Fame drave them into a perpetuall storme, till by the divine mindes of these incomparable Paire, the Muses and they were received into protection, and establisht in this monarchy, to the incouragement and security of those well-borne wits represented by the Prophetick Priests of the Britanides. The Scene where this goddesse of brightnesse was discovered, was stiled the garden of the Britanides, or Muses of great Brittaine, not inferiour in beautie to that of the Hesperides, or that of Alcinous, celebrated by Homer. The conclusion of all was an applause and confirmation of those Deities or second causes by whose influence at this prefixed time, the Britanides and their Prophetick Priests were to be establisht in this garden, by the unanimous and magnificent vertues of the King and Queenes Majesties making this happy Island a patterne to all Nations, as Greece was amongst the Ancients. </p>
        <p>The ornament which serv'd as a Bordure to enclose the Scene, was raised on two round Basements, on which were Satyres bigger than the life, bearing baskets of fruits, and knots of young Satyres clinging about their leggs in extravagant postures: above these ran cornicements, which made the ground of <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000134-003-b"/>a second order, wherein were termes of women fained of silver, and children in their naturall colours standing on arches, some wantonising about those termes, and others holding great vizards before their faces: On the heads of the Termes were cushions which served for capitals, that bore the finishing of composed frontispices of great scrowles with frutages, from whence hung lighted Lamps. </p>
        <p>In the Freeze above was other young Satyres, which seem'd oppress'd with the burthen of great festons, the husks of which were tied up in knots to a double compartiment composed of scrowles, quadratures, and Masque heads, in the midst hung a drapery fained, of cloth of silver, and in it was written LVMINALIA: under all this ranne a large valens of gold embroidered with flowers and great Tassels. </p>
        <p>The Kings Majestie being seated under the State, the curtaine in an instant disappear'd discovering a Scene all of darknesse, the neerer part woody, and farther off more open with a calme River, that tooke the shadowes of the Trees by the light of the Moone, that appear'd shining in the River; there being no more light to lighten the whole Scene than served to distinguish the severall grounds, that seemed to run farre in from the eye, with this Scene of darknesse was heard the voyces of Birds of Night. </p>
        <p>This strange Scene having a while entertained the sight of the spectators, there arose out of the hollow caverns of the earth a duskie cloud, and on it a Chariot enricht and drawne by two great owles, on this sate a matron in a purple robe, with starres of gold <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000134-004-a"/>and large black wings displaied, her browne haire loose, and on her head a vaile of russet cipresse, with a picked crowne and a golden Scepter in her hand; Representing night: she tels she came to give repose to the labours of mortals: but seing all things here tending to feasts and revels, shee with her attendants will give her assistance, though it serve but as a foile to set off more nobler representations. </p>

        <p>Silence an old man in a skin coat close to his body set full of eyes, his mantle tawny, and a girland of Peach-tree about his head. </p>
        <p>The first vigill in a robe of blue, with a red mantle, her haire hanging downe in locks, and a bat setting before. </p>
