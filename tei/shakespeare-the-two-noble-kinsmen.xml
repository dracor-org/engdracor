          <l>Much follow'd both, for both much mony g'yn, </l>
          <l>If they stand sound, and well; And a good Play </l>
          <l>(Whose modest Sceanes blush on his marriage day, </l>
          <l>And shake to loose his honour) is like hir </l>
          <l>That after holy Tye, and first nights stir </l>
          <l>Yet still is Modestie, and still retaines </l>
          <l>More of the maid to sight, than Husbands paines; </l>
          <l>We pray our Play may be so; For I am sure </l>
          <l>It has a noble Breeder, and a pure, </l>
          <l>A learned, and a Poet never went </l>
          <l>More famous yet twixt Po and silver Trent. </l>
          <l>Chaucer (of all admir'd) the Story gives, </l>
          <l>There constant to Eternity it lives; </l>
          <l>If we let fall the Noblenesse of this, </l>
          <l>And the first sound this child beare, be a hisse, </l>
          <l>How will it shake the bones of that good man, </l>
          <l>And make him cry from under ground, O fan </l>
          <l>From me the witles chaffe of such a wrighter </l>
          <l>That blastes my Bayes, and my fam'd workes makes lighter </l>
          <l>Then Robin Hood? This is the feare we bring; </l>
          <l>For to say Truth, it were an endlesse thing, </l>
          <l>And too ambitious to aspire to him; </l>
          <l>Weake as we are, and almost breathlesse swim </l>
          <l>In this deepe water. Do but you hold out </l>
          <l>Your helping hands, and we shall take about, </l>
          <l>And something doe to save us: You shall heare </l>
          <l>Sceanes though below his Art, may yet appeare </l>
          <l>Worth two houres travell. To his bones sweet sleepe: </l>
          <l>Content to you. If this play doe not keepe, </l>
          <l>A little dull time from us, we perceave </l>
