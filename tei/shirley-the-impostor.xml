        </opener>
        <p>IT hath been a Complement with some, when they have treated Friends, to profess a barrenness in that which they had prepared not without studied charge, and Curiositie. As I was never so insolent to magnifie my own, being best acquainted with my weak abilities: so I should deserve a just affront to my self, and undervalue your person, to present you with any thing were first cheap in my own opinion. Sir, this Poem, I may with modesty affirm, had a fair reception, when it was personated <pb xml:id="ep000750-120-a"/>on the stage, and may march in the first rank of my own compositions, which directed now by my humble devotion, comes from the press to kiss your hand, and bear your noble Name in the dedication. I cannot have so much prejudice upon your nature, to think you will decline it, and should I abate those other characters of honour that shine upon you, your indulgence to Musick and singular love to the worthy professors eminently, shew the harmony of your soul, and while Poetry is received a Musicall part of humane knowledge, I cannot despair of your candid entertainment. Sr. I beseech you take it, as an earnest of my thoughts to serve you, I am assured it brings with it, beside the acknowlegment of your late obligation upon me, ambitious desires to preserve my interest in your favour, while I subscribe my self, </p>

        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <l>OUr poet not full confident he says, </l>
        <l>When Theaters free vote had crown'd his plays, </l>
        <l>Came never with more trembling to the stage, </l>
        <l>Since that poetick Schism possest the age. </l>
        <l>A Prologue must have more wit than the play, </l>
        <l>He knowes not what to write, fears what to say. </l>
        <l>He has been stranger long to'th' English scene, </l>
        <l>Knowes not the mode, nor how with artfull pen, </l>
        <l>To charm your airy soules; beside, he sees </l>
        <l>The Muses have forsook their groves, the trees </l>
        <l>That fear'd no thunder, and were safely worn </l>
        <l>By Phaebus own priests, are now rudely torn </l>
        <l>By every scurrile wit that can but say </l>
        <l>He made a Prologue to a new— no play. </l>
        <l>But let 'em pass; you Gentlemen that sit </l>
        <l>Our judges, great Commissioners of wit, </l>
        <l>Be pleas'd I may one humble motion make, </l>
        <l>'Tis that you would resolve for th' authors sake, </l>
        <l>I'th' progress of his play not to be such </l>
        <l>who'l understand too little, or too much </l>
        <l>But choose your way to Iudge; to th' Ladies one </l>
        <l>Address from the Author, and the Prologue's done, </l>
        <l>In all his Poems, you have been his care, </l>
        <l>Nor shall you need to wrinckle now that fair </l>
        <l>Smooth Alablaster of your brow, no fright </l>
        <l>Shall strike chast eares, or dye the harmlese white </l>
        <l>Of any cheek with blushes, by this pen </l>
        <l>No Innocence shall bleed in any scene, </l>
        <l>If then your thoughts secur'd you smile, the wise </l>
        <l>Will learn to like by looking on your eyes. </l>
