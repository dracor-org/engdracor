If with ayre, what so proper as your fume: what fume so healthfull as your perfume? what perfume so soueraigne as Tabacco? Besides the excellent edge it giues a mans wit, [as they can best iudge that haue beene present at a feast of Tobacco where commonly all good witts are consorted] what varietie of discourse it begetts? What sparkes of wit it yeelds, it is a world to heare as likewise to the courage of a man, for if it be true, that Iohannes de sauo et sauo et writes, that hee that drinkes Veriuice pisseth vinegere, Then it must needs follow to be as true, that hoe that eates smoke, farts fire; for Garlicke I will not say because it is a plant of our owne country? but it may cure the diseases of the country, but for the diseases of the Court, they are out of the Element of Garlick to medicine; to conclude as there is no enemy to Tabacco but Garlick, so there is no friend to Garlick, but a sheeps head and so I conclude. </p>

              <p>Employed? I mary sir, they were the men that first kindled this humor of employment in me: a pox of employment I say: it has cost me, but what it has cost me, it skils not: they haue thrust vpon me a crew of thredbare, vnbutton'd fellowes, <pb xml:id="ep000800-032-a"/>to be my followers: Taylers, Frippers, Brokers, casheerd Clarks, Pettifoggers, and I know not who I: S'light I thinke they haue swept all the bowling allies ith citie for them: and a crew of these, rakt like old ragges out of dunghils by candle light, haue they presented to me in very good fashion, to be gentlemen of my traine, and solde them hope of raising their fortunes by me: A plague on that phrase, Raising of fortunes, it has vndone more men when ten dicing houses? Raise their fortunes with a vengeance? And a man will play the foole and be a Lord, or be a foole and play the Lord, he shall be sure to want no followers, so there be hope to raise their fortunes. A burning feuer light on you, and all such followers. S'foote they say followers are but shadowes, that follow their Lords no longer then the sunshines on them: but I finde it not so: the sunne is set vpon my employment, and yet I cannot shake off my shadowes; my followers grow to my heeles like kibes, I cannot stir out of doores for am. And your grace haue any employment for followers, pray entertaine my companie: theyle spend their bloud in your seruice, for they haue little else to spend, you may soone raise their fortunes. </p>
