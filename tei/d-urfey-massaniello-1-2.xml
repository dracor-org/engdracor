            <head>To the Right Honourable THOMAS Lord LEIGH, OF Stone-Leigh, in the County of Warwick. </head>
            <opener>
              <salute>My Lord, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen the Great Atticus retir'd from Rome, to employ his happy Hours amongst Rural Pleasures, tho his Contentment by that resolution, might be judg'd most Dear to him, at a distance from the Town's Hurry and Noise, to indulge with the charming Quiet, and sweet Diversions of the Country, yet nevertheless, the Merit and Vertue of such a Patron being too highly Celebrated, to let any envious Space be a Bar to their Addresses; <hi>Horace, Ovid</hi>, and the rest, never fail'd in their Poetical Correspondence, nor in often Dedicating to so great a Judge, their choicest of Labours. </p>
            <p>'Tis from this Scien, my Lord, that my present Ambition Sprouts and Grows; and tho the Work I present, is not so worthy as it ought to be (aspiring to this Honour;) and likewise tho my Acquaintance and Knowledge of your Lordship, is scarce old enough to warrant this Presumption, yet you have so large an Interest in Fame, that I am well assur'd, your unquestion'd Reputation will Dignify the one, and your offer'd <pb xml:id="ep000543-002-a"/>Courtesie, and generous Affability, Excuse and Pardon the other. </p>
            <p>The most material part of other Dedications, I am sensible, are generally stuff'd with the Patron's Praises, and tho my Lord, your generous Hospitality, your admirable Temper of Mind, and many other flourishing Vertues, which the World owns you to be Master of, may justly exact from a Poet his best Skill in an Encomium, yet fear to Offend, or lessen the value of a Modest Courtesie, which in its own Nature, is above all that I can Write to Extol it, makes me desist from a Theme fit to Inspire the best of Pens, and Improve the richest of Fansies. </p>
            <p>'Tis doubtless the depraved Quality of the present Times, which makes that often appear Flattery, which considering the real Merit of the Person, may properly be but Iustice. The greatest Wits of former Ages, I am sure, were of this Opinion, that never spar'd with their highest Elegance, to Illustrate the Character of their Patrons, who in return, with their choicest Favours, express'd their Gratitude, without Blushing, or believing that to be a Compliment, which was Naturally a due belonging to their Merit. </p>
            <q>
              <l>When Sacred Virgil by Augustus sate </l>
              <l>To read the Work he was to Dedicate, </l>
              <l>The Praises ev'n Extravagant did seem, </l>
              <l>Yet Caesar did not think he Flatter'd him. </l>
            </q>
            <pb xml:id="ep000543-002-b"/>
            <p>But this in our Adulterated Age, is now looked on as an Offence, and consequently the Meritorious miss of their Plaudit. Be pleas'd therefore, <hi>My Lord</hi>, to believe, I Think what I dare not Write; and if your Lordship will be pleas'd to accept of this way of introducing my self into your Favour, it will be as well the greatest Happiness, as highest Honour, </p>

            <l>IF I'm of Age, to know what's Good from Bad, </l>
            <l>I must declare our Patentees are Mad; </l>
            <l>They've known my Comick Humour all along, </l>
            <l>And yet this Morning sent me here— a Song, </l>
            <l>A nimble dapper Dancing-Master too, </l>
            <l>And bids me chuse, for nothing else will do. </l>
            <l>Mad, Mad, stark Mad. Let's see, <hi>Sol la, me, sol. </hi>

            <l>For can they ever think I will comply— </l>
            <l>I Dance, I Sing; <stage xml:id="ep000543-e1550">* Capers awkerdly. </stage>they'd as good bid me Fly, </l>
            <l>For as toth' first, my English Bulk's not made; </l>
            <l>I want an Air for Monsieur's Capring Trade: </l>
            <l>And for the next,— </l>
            <l>If they expect, I'll be a Capon for't, </l>
            <l>I'd have 'em know, my Salary's too short; </l>
            <l>I'd do much for Diversion of the Town, </l>
            <l>But not do something to lose all my own. </l>
            <l>Ah, Sirs, you are the cause of these our Streights, </l>
            <l>You still have been our dire malignant Fates: </l>
            <l>By your lewd Humours first, which when we follow'd </l>
            <l>Our Smutty Plays out of our Doors were Hollow'd, </l>
            <l>And Zealous Spirits 'gainst our Function Bellow'd. </l>
            <l>And then besides, your Critick Quality, </l>
            <l>Makes such a wretched Drug of Poetry, </l>
            <l>That we are forc'd, to help our Withering Bays, </l>
            <l>Strangers to Hire, of Sigismundian Race, </l>
            <l>At Price so dear, we purchase Voices Killing, </l>
            <l>They're Laughing at us, when we think 'em Trilling. </l>
            <l>Oh, what vast Sums, since our late Vein of Plotting, </l>
            <l>Have both our Houses paid, for Quavering and for Cutting: </l>
            <l>So much, that I in Melancholy Case, </l>
            <l>With looking Gravely, have quite spoil'd my Face: </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000543-003-b"/>
            <l>They may be Merry, as their Gains provoke, </l>
            <l>But I, a Lose● have forgot to Ioak. </l>
            <l>I was a taking Fool some time ago, </l>
            <l>But now as out of Fashion as a Beau; </l>
            <l>My Trade's quite spoil'd, I cannot vend my Ware, </l>
            <l>Ah, would to Heav'n I were a Dancing Bear, </l>
            <l>Or any other Monster, but a Player, </l>
            <l>A singing French Baboon, just come from Lorrain, </l>
            <l>A Hedg-hog, giv't but out that I am Foreign, </l>
            <l>I'll draw the City Fops, and Suburb Whores, </l>
            <l>And Cheat the Town by Sixes, and by Fours. </l>
            <l>But since our Poet is resolv'd to day, </l>
            <l>Once more to entertain you with a Play, </l>
            <l>A famous Story, and known lately True, </l>
            <l>Mixt with good Humour, and good Musick too, </l>
            <l>Which there is in it, give the Devil his due: </l>
            <l>I'll once more hope too, it will please your Fansies, </l>
            <l>As well as if it were all Songs and Dances. </l>
            <l>And if some Foes their Malice should pursue, </l>
            <l>Let but our Friends do generous Iustice too, </l>
            <l>We'll Criticks fear no more, those Play degraders, </l>
            <l>Than Wise Men did of late the new Invaders. </l>
            <l>The first, our Heroes of sharp Vnderstanding, </l>
            <l>On Wit's fair Island, shall oppose from Landing. </l>
            <l>Th' last, which some say, meer Courtesie retards </l>
            <l>From coming, being Civil to our Guards, </l>
            <l>Should, e'er their Hot-brain'd Frenzy hither call 'em; </l>
            <l>Oh, how our Terrible Train'd-Bands would maul 'em. </l>

            <l>FOr fear ill-Humour in tour Hearts should reign, </l>
            <l>And that you should be in the Damning Vein, </l>
            <l>At my Suit, that am not oft so bold, </l>
            <l>Suspend your Iudgment, till the Tale be told. </l>
            <l>A Rebel's Rise, we only now Present, </l>
            <l>The next Part shews his Fall and Punishment; </l>
            <l>And Vnjust Iudges you may well be thought, </l>
            <l>That Sentence, e'er you have heard out the Fault. </l>
            <l>For my own part, plagu'd with no envious Fury, </l>
            <l>Were I to sit among the Poet's Iury, </l>
            <l>He should come off, and have a Plaudit free, </l>
            <l>For th' Character of my kind Lord and me: </l>
            <l>A Husband vent'ring so to save his Wife, </l>
            <l>And she, for his sake, slighting her own Life; </l>
            <l>Our good Example, is enough to day, </l>
            <l>Were there no Merit else to save the Play: </l>
            <l>Turtles whom Love, so mutually does Wound; </l>
            <l>Such Rarities— where are they to be found? </l>
            <l>Therefore Gallants all, that your Spouses love, </l>
            <l>Pleas'd with the Subject, must our Scenes approve: </l>
            <l>And you, fair Ladies, that have Husbands dear, </l>
            <l>Concern'd must in the Poet's Cause appear; </l>
            <l>Nor let the Virgin Stars forget to shine, </l>
            <l>As they expect a Lover like to mine. </l>
            <l>As for the rest that slight these solid Matters, </l>
            <l>The wild Town Doxies, and the Marriage haters, </l>
            <l>If them you cannot Convert, you can Confound; </l>
            <l>Give but your Hands, and let Consent go round, </l>

They lately chose Philomerino Cardinal, and the officious Nobles throng'd the Conclave to shut out my Deserts from being President, as I so long Expected; which to revenge,— I've subtilly wove my self into the Councels of the new Rais'd Plebeian, Massaniello, who tho a Fisherman,— has yet a Spirit of unmatched Force; a Head too as well turn'd for Mischief as this here— and who now with Resolution and Sense, not found before in such Course Breeding, has stirr'd the People to put down the Gabells; some Numbers are already rose, and— Mataloni and his Confederates, the Marks they shoot at. That Bow I'll help to bend;— Oh!— here's the Idol Cardinal and the Great Duke— <q>

What greater Plague can there befall a City, than a Disunion and divided Interest? What destroy'd Carthage, but two mighty Factions, the Barchiniani and th' Hanoniani? What maintain'd War in France for Sixty Years, but Jars 'twixt th' House of Burgundy and Orleans? Or what late brought to England Desolation, and caused so many several bloody Battles, wherein were Eighty of their Nobles Slain, but th' Faction of the Houses, York and Lancaster? And nothing, be assured, can urge our Ruine so soon as that in Naples.— A City is like a Ship, Divisions are her Leaks,— and whilst the Mariners fight, the Sea runs in and drowns all.— I have done, only one word more— The Neapolitans, as I've observ'd 'em, are not like a Top,— they will not sleep with Scourging.

            <l>AS some stale Luckless Mistress of the Town, </l>
            <l>With former Lovers out of Favour grown; </l>
            <l>Tries Art in vain new Appetite to raise, </l>
            <l>And bring into fresh Play her slighted Face: </l>
            <l>In such forlorn condition now are Plays. </l>
            <l>The Muses Grace no longer can perswade, </l>
            <l>We find their Beauty, or your Taste decay'd. </l>
            <l>The Season too our Interest does oppose, </l>
            <l>Warm Weather and May-Fair are Martial Foes; </l>
            <l>For whilst th' Great at th' Park in Coaches Loll, </l>
            <l>And Dames of humbler Fortunes foot the Mall, </l>
            <l>And Citts divert themselves at Miller's Droll. </l>
            <l>We strut alas, who cease no Pains nor Care, </l>
            <l>To empty Boxes, and to Benches bare: </l>
            <l>Hear what a Dismal sound from Hollow Walls, </l>
            <l>Fills our sad Ears when a fierce Hero bawls. </l>
            <l>Thus when y'are absent our own Knells we Toll, </l>
            <l>And loss of you is our departed Soul: </l>
            <l>Hard Fate too, that the Sun that brings us Flowers, </l>
            <l>And cheers the Nation round with Genial Powers, </l>
            <l>Should to all Harvests be a friend but ours. </l>
            <l>Yet thus it is, when as their Zeal's inclin'd </l>
            <l>To praise his Beams, we pray for Rain and Wind: </l>
            <l>In Rain to Marrobone no Bowler goes, </l>
            <l>And Wind the Ladies from the Circle blows: </l>
            <l>But when the Sun shines clear, then all are fled, </l>
            <l>Whilst we like Cattle in a Parch'd-up Mead, </l>
            <l>Condemn'd to one poor Barren spot of Ground, </l>
            <l>Run to next Covert, where cool Draughts are found; </l>
            <l>There chew the Cud our Audience turn'd away, </l>
            <l>And drink to better Fortune the next day. </l>
            <l>This your hard usage oft has forc'd us to; </l>
            <l>You will not sure such Rigour always shew; </l>
            <l>Our Second Part needs must indulge your Taste, </l>
            <l>'Tis th' Rebels Fall, much shorter too than th' Last. </l>
            <l>Let a regard to both, your Humour sway, </l>
            <l>Let some be for the Park, some for the Play. </l>
            <l>As for you Bowling Sparks can you find here </l>
            <l>No other sport as good this time o'th ' Year, </l>
            <l>Is Side-Box quite forgot, and the Masqu'd Dear? </l>

            <l>I colour'd like a Rose, and trembled too; </l>
            <l>For Heaven knows for 'em what I was to do. </l>
            <l>But taking heart I angry answer'd thus: </l>
            <l>What mean ye, Sir, d'ee take me for Miss— </l>
            <l>A certain Lady we have lately lost? </l>
            <l>And at that word finding he'd make more pother, </l>
            <l>I started up and said, I'd call my Mother. </l>
            <l>At that, says he, and as he spoke it smil'd, </l>
            <l>Why sure you wont— you wont be such a Child, </l>
            <l>There's none but Babies let their Mothers know, </l>
            <l>I was asham'd that he should think me so. </l>
            <l>We love the Childish scandal to prevent, </l>
            <l>To be thought fit, altho' we don't consent; </l>
            <l>So much confus'd I left him— this Relation </l>
            <l>I leave for you, Sirs, to make Application. </l>
            <l>If you forsake our Plays, and I am slighted, </l>
            <l>You see at least I one way may be righted, </l>
            <l>Young as I am— Knight-Errant can provide, </l>
            <l>That me to Paris will on Cock-horse guide. </l>
