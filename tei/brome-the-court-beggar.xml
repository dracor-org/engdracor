          <l>For of late day's (he know's not (how) y'are grown, </l>
          <l>Deeply in love with a new strayne of wit </l>
          <l>Which he condemns, at least disliketh it, </l>
          <l>And solemnely protests you are to blame </l>
          <l>If at his hands you doe expect the same; </l>
          <l>Hee'l tread his usuall way, no gaudy Sceane </l>
          <l>Shall give instructions, what his plot doth meane; </l>
          <l>No handsome Love-toy shall your time beguile </l>
          <l>Forcing your pitty to a sigh or smile. </l>

          <l>His humerous expectation with a smile, </l>
          <l>As if you would be satisfy'd, although </l>
          <l>His Comedy containes no antique show. </l>
        </lg>

          <p>And why you now? or you? or you? I'le speak enough for you all, you now would tell the Audients they should not feare to throng hither the next day: for you wil secure their Purses cut-free, and their pockets pick-free. Tis much for you to do tho'. And you would say that all <pb xml:id="ep000463-052-b"/>your projects are put down, and you'l take up no new: but what shall be (spectators) to please you. And you Poetick part induces you, t'appologize now for the Poet too, as they ha' done already, you to the Ladies, you to the Cavaliers and Gentry; you to the City friend, and all for the Poet, Poet, Poet, when alls but begging tho. I'le speak to 'em all, and to my Countrey folkes too if here be any o'em: and yet not beg for the Poet tho', why should we? has not he money for his doings? and the best price too? because we would ha' the best: And if it be not, why so? The Poet has shewd his wit and we our manners. But to stand beg, beg for reputation for one that has no countenance to carry it, and must ha' money is such a Pastime!â If it were for one of the great and curious Poets that give these Playes as the Prologue said, and money too, to have 'em acted; For them, indeed, we are bound to ply for an applause. Because they look for nothing else, and scorn to beg for themselves. But then you'l say those Playes are not given to you; you pay as much for your seats at them as at these, though you sit nere the merrier, nor rise the wiser, they are so above common understanding; and tho' you see for your love you will judge for your money, why so for that too, you may. But take heed you displease not the Ladies tho' who are their partiall judges, being brib'd by flattering verses to commend their Playes; for whose faire cause, and by their powerfull voyces to be cry'd up wits o' Court, the right worshipfull Poets boast to have made those enterludes, when for ought you know they bought 'em of Universitie Scholars tho', and onely shew their own wits in owning other mens; and that but as they are like neither. As thus, do you like that Song? yes. I made it. Is that Scene or that Jest good? Yes, Twas mine; and then if all be good 'twas all mine. There's wit in that now. But this small Poet vents none but his own, and his by whose care <pb xml:id="ep000463-053-a"/>and directions this Stage is govern'd, who has for many yeares both in his fathers dayes, and since directed Poets to write &amp; Players to speak, till he traind up these youths here to what they are now. I some of 'em from before they were able to say a grace of two lines long to have more parts in their pates then would fill so many Dry-fats. And to be serious with you, if after all this, by the venemous practise of some, who study nothing more then his destruction, he should faile us, both Poets and Players would be at losse in Reputation. But this is from our Poet agen, who tels you plainly all the helps he has or desires; And let me tell you he has made prety merry Jigges that ha' pleas'd a many. As (le'me see) th' Antipodes, and (oh I shall never forget) Tom Hoyden o' Tanton Deane. Hee'l bring him hither very shortly in a new Motion, and in a new paire o' slops and new nether-stocks as briske as a Body-lowse in a new Pasture. </p>
