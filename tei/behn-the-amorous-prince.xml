        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WEll! you expect a Prologue to the Play, </l>
        <l>And you expect it too Petition-way; </l>
        <l>With <hi>Chapeau bas</hi>, beseeching you t'excuse, </l>
        <l>Adamn'd Intrigue of an unpractic'd Muse; </l>
        <l>Tell you it's fortune waits upon your smiles, </l>
        <l>And when you frown, Lord how you kill the whiles! </l>
        <l>Or else to rally up the sins of th' Age, </l>
        <l>And bring each Fop in Town upon the Stage; </l>
        <l>And in one Prologue run more vices o're, </l>
        <l>Then either Court or City knew before; </l>
        <l>And that's a wonder which will please you too, </l>
        <l>But my Commission's not to please you now. </l>
        <l>First then for you grave Dons who love no Play </l>
        <l>But what is regular, Great Johnson's way; </l>
        <l>Who hate the Monsieur with the Farce and Droll, </l>
        <l>But are for things well said with spirit and soul; </l>
        <l>'Tis you I mean whose judgments will admit, </l>
        <l>No Interludes of fooling with your Wit; </l>
        <l>You're here defeated, and anon will cry </l>
        <l>s' Death! wou'd twere treason to write Comedy. </l>
        <l>So! there's a party lost; now for the rest, </l>
        <l>Who swear they'd rather hear a smutty jest, </l>
        <l>Spoken by Nokes or Angel, then a Scene </l>
        <l>Of the admir'd and well-penn'd Cataline; </l>
        <l>Who love the Comick Hat, the Iig and Dance, </l>
        <l>Things that are fitted to their Ignorance: </l>
        <l>You too are quite undone, for here's no Farce, </l>
        <l>Damn me! you'l cry, this Play will be mine A&#8212; </l>
        <l>Not serious, nor yet Comick, what is't then? </l>
        <l>Th' imperfect issue of a Lukewarm brain: </l>
        <l>'Twas born before it's time, and such a whelp, </l>
        <l>As all the after-lickings could not help. </l>
        <l>Bait it then as ye please, we'le not desend it, </l>
        <l>But he that dis-approves it, let him mend it. </l>

        <l>LAdies the Prince was kind at last, </l>
        <l>But all the danger is not pass'd; </l>
        <l>I cannot happy be till you approve, </l>
        <l>My hasty condescention to his Love. </l>
        <l>'Twas want of Art, not Vertue was my Crime, </l>
        <l>And that's, I vow, the Authors fault, not mine: </l>
        <l>She might have made the Women pitiless, </l>
        <l>But that had harder been to me than this: </l>
        <l>She might have made our Lovers constant too, </l>
        <l>A work which Heaven it self can scarcely do; </l>
        <l>But simple Nature never taught the way, </l>
        <l>To hide those passions which she must obey. </l>
        <l>Humble Cottages and Cells, </l>
        <l>Where Innocence and Virtue dwells; </l>
        <l>Then Courts no more secure can be, </l>
        <l>From Love and dangerous flattery. </l>
        <l>Love in rural triumph reigns, </l>
        <l>As much a God amongst the Swains, </l>
        <l>As if the Sacrifices paid, </l>
        <l>Were wounded hearts by Monarchs made; </l>
        <l>And this might well excuse m' offence, </l>
        <l>If it be so to Love a Prince. </l>
        <l>But Ladies, 'tis your hands alone, </l>
        <l>And not his power can raise me to a Throne; </l>
        <l>Without that aid I cannot reign, </l>
        <l>But will return back to my flocks again. </l>
