        <head>To the Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Having had the Honour to have liv'd so many years in Your Lordships favour, and to have been always exceedingly oblig'd by Your Lordship, ought to be glad of any opporttunity of Publishing my Gratitude. And the offering this Comedy to Your Lordship may not perhaps be thought an improper occasion of doing it; for the first Act of it was written at Copt-Hall; and Your Lordships Approbation of it (whose Wit and Iudgment have ever been unquestion'd) encourag'd and inspir'd me to go on: When I had finished it, which was in a Months time, Your Lordship, upon the perusal of the whole, was pleas'd to say that you thought it a true, and diverting Comedy. </p>
        <p>This, I must confess, made me hope for success upon the Stage, which it met with, but so great, as was above my expectation (in this Age which has run mad after Farces) no Comedy, for these many years, having fill'd the Theatre so long together: And I had the great Honour to find so many Friends, that the House was never so full since it was built, as upon the third day of this Play; and vast numbers went away, that could not be admitted. </p>
        <p>This extraordinary success the more emboldens me to lay the Play at Your Lordships Feet; in whose service, I should be glad to employ my whole Life. </p>
        <p>I shall not, according to the Custom of Dedications, make a long Panegyrick to Your Lordship, 'tis superfluous <pb xml:id="ep000736-003-a"/>and impertinent, to praise him whom all men speak well of, and of whom I never heard any man speak ill: Your Lordship is the Favourite of Mankind; and You deserve to be so, for You are ever obliging, and seeking out occasions of doing good, and exerting Your Charity and Generosity, in which You never lose a day. </p>
        <p>I must acknowledge my self infinitely oblig'd to Your Lordship every way; but particularly, that I have the freedom of being receiv'd as one of Your Family at Copthall; where not only the excellence of the Air, and regulariy of Living contribute to my Health, but I have the Honour of enjoying the conversation which in all the World I would chuse. </p>
        <p>It is to me, and it must needs be to all who wish Your Lordship well, an extraordinary satisfaction to observe that You have laid so certain a foundation of solid happiness, for all the remaining part of Your Life; in retiring from all the unsatisfying pleasures, and noisie troubles of the Town, to so sweet a place, with so admirable a Lady, who in Beauty is exceeded by none, and has all those qualities of mind besides, which serve to make an excellent Lady, an extraordinary Governess of a Family, and an incomparable Wife; whose Fruitfulness is like to bless Your Lordship with a Beauteous, Noble and Numerous Issue. And may Your Lordship and She long enjoy one another, and all the Blessings You Your selves can imagine or desire. <hi>I am</hi>, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE, To the <hi>Squire of Alsatia</hi>. Spoken by Mr. Mountfort. </head>
        <l>HOw have we in the space of one poor Age, </l>
        <l>Beheld the Rise and Downfal of the Stage! </l>
        <l>When, with our King restor'd, it first arose, </l>
        <l>They did each day some good old Play expose; </l>
        <l>And then it flourish'd: Till, with Manna tir'd, </l>
        <l>For wholesome Food ye nauseous Trash desir'd. </l>
        <l>Then rose the whiffling Scribblers of those days, </l>
        <l>Who since have liv'd to bury all their Plays; </l>
        <l>And had their issue full as num'rous been </l>
        <l>As Priams, they the Fate of all had seen. </l>
        <l>With what prodigious scarcity of Wit </l>
        <l>Did the new Authors starve the hungry Pit? </l>
        <l>Infected by the French, you must have Rhime, </l>
        <l>Which long, to please the Ladies ears, did chime. </l>
        <l>Soon after this came Ranting Fustian in, </l>
        <l>And none but Plays upon the fret were seen: </l>
        <l>Such Roaring Bombast stuff, which Fops would praise, </l>
        <l>Tore our best Actors Lungs, cut short their days. </l>
        <l>Some in small time did this distemper kill, </l>
        <l>And had the savage Authors gone on still, </l>
        <l>Fustian had been a new Disease i'th' Bill. </l>
        <l>When Time, which all things trys, had laid Rhime dead, </l>
        <l>The vile Vsurper Farce reign'd in its stead. </l>
        <l>Then came Machines, brought from a Neighbour Nation, </l>
        <l>Oh how we suffer'd under Decoration. </l>
        <l>If all this stuff has not quite spoyl'd your taste, </l>
        <l>Pray let a Comedy once more be grac'd: </l>
        <l>Which does not Monsters represent, but Men, </l>
        <l>Conforming to the Rules of Master Ben. </l>
        <l>Our Author, ever having him in view, </l>
        <l>At humble distance would this steps pursue. </l>
        <l>He to correct, and to inform did write: </l>
        <l>If Poets aim at nought but to delight, </l>
        <l>Fidlers have to the Bays an equal right. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000736-004-a"/>
        <l>Our Poet found your gentle Fathers kind, </l>
        <l>And now some of his works your favour find. </l>
        <l>He'll treat you still with somewhat that is new, </l>
        <l>But whether good or bad, he leaves to you. </l>
        <l>Baudy the nicest Ladies need not fear, </l>
        <l>The quickest fancy shall extract none here. </l>
        <l>We will not make 'em blush, by which is shown </l>
        <l>How much their bought Red differs from their own. </l>
        <l>No Fop no Beau shall just exceptions make, </l>
        <l>None but abandon'd Knaves offence shall take: </l>
        <l>Such Knaves as he industriously offends, </l>
        <l>And should be very loth to have his Friends. </l>
        <l>For you who bring good humour to the Play, </l>
        <l>We'll do our best to make you laugh to day. </l>

Ah Brother, I must confess it was a kindness in you, when Heaven had blest you with a great Estate by Merchandize, to adopt my Younger Son, and take him and breed him from his Childhood: But you have been so gentle to him, he is run into all manner of Vice and Riot; no bounds can hold him; no shame can stop him; no Laws nor Customs can restrain him. </p>

        <l>YE mighty scowrers of these narrow Seas, </l>
        <l>Who suffer not a Bark to sail in peace, </l>
        <l>But with your Tire of Culverins ye roar, </l>
        <l>Bring 'em by th' Lee, and Rummidge all their store; </l>
        <l>Our Poet duck'd, and look'd as if half dead, </l>
        <l>At every Shot that whistled o're his Head. </l>
        <l>Frequent Engagements ne're could make him bold, </l>
        <l>He sneak'd into a corner of the Hold. </l>
        <l>Since he submits, pray ease him of his fear, </l>
        <l>And with a joynt Applause bid him appear, </l>
        <l>Good Criticks don't insult and domineer. </l>
        <l>He fears not Sparks, who with brisk dress and meen, </l>
        <l>Come not to hear or see, but to be seen. </l>
        <l>Each prunes himself, and with a languishing Eye, </l>
        <l>Designs to kill a Lady by the by. </l>
        <l>Let each fantastick ugly Beau and Shape, </l>
        <l>Little of Man, and very much of Ape, </l>
        <l>Admire himself, and let the Poet scape. </l>
        <l>Ladies, Your Anger most he apprehends, </l>
        <l>And is grown past the Age of making Friends </l>
        <l>Of any of the Sex whom he offends. </l>
        <l>No Princess frowns, no Hero rants and whines, </l>
        <l>Nor is weak Sense embroyder'd with strong lines: </l>
        <pb n="88" xml:id="ep000736-049-a"/>
        <l>No Battels, Trumpets, Drums, not any dye; </l>
        <l>No Mortal Wounds, to please your Cruelty; </l>
        <l>Who like not any thing but Tragedy. </l>
        <l>With fond, unnatural extravagancies, </l>
        <l>Stolen from the silly Authors of Romances. </l>
        <l>Let such the Chamber-maids diversion be, </l>
        <l>Pray be you reconcil'd to Comedy. </l>
        <l>For when we make you merry, you must own </l>
        <l>You are much prettier than when you frown. </l>
        <l>With charming smiles you use to conquer still, </l>
        <l>The melancholly look's not apt to kill. </l>
        <l>Our Poet begs you who adorn this Sphere, </l>
        <l>This Shining Circle, will not be severe. </l>
        <l>Here no <hi>Chit chat</hi>, here no <hi>Tea Tables </hi>are. </l>
        <l>The Cant he hopes will not be long unknown, </l>
        <l>'Tis almost grown the language of the Town. </l>
        <l>For Fops, who feel a wretched want of Wit, </l>
        <l>Still set up something that may pass for it. </l>
        <l>He begs that you will often grace his Play, </l>
        <l>And lets you know Munday's his visiting day. </l>
