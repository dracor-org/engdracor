        <head>TO HER GRACE THE DUTCHESSE OF PORTSMOUTH. </head>
        <p>BEauty (Madam) has received from Nature a Dominion so pleasing, that Men contend not with more ambition for Empire over their own Sex, than subjection to Yours. Kings have worn Your Sexes Chains with as much pleasure as their Crowns, and Conquerours have followed Your Triumphs with as much delight as they have seen their own attended by Kings: A Dominion so absolute, that all Your Commands are Laws. Indeed Princes who are beloved, shall be absolute, their Subjects will force Arbitrary Power upon 'em: Nothing enslaves like Love, Force binds our Hands, but Love captivates our Hearts. How absolute then must Beauty be? No man yet ever had the will much less the power to rebell against it. They who should seek to depose it, would begin a Civil War in their own bosoms, and lay <pb xml:id="ep000506-003-a"/>waste and ruinate the most delightful Possessions of their minds. And (lastly) so large, that it finds Subjects where it finds men: Its Empire extends as far as Humane Nature, and its Spoils are all that's excellent in the whole Creation. But men claim to be subjects of its Empire as the birth-right of Reason, and esteem that (too) as one of Reason's great advantages. Beasts are excluded that Claim; cannot be naturalized into that Dominion, for want of the ennoblements of Reason. Men are exalted to love Beauty by the same faculty which lifts 'em to adore Heaven; and there is a kind of Divinity in Beauty, which makes Love to be a kind of Religion: Beauty is certainly the fairest visible Image of Divinity in the world. The Ancients, therefore, built Temples and Altars to it, and ranked it amongst Celestial Powers. We Christians have much ado to abstain from that Idolatry; however we pay it as high Honours, though under other Names. That these, Madam, are the Rights and Possessions of Beauty, you cannot but know; that they are therefore yours all the World knows, but you. But, Madam, wrong your Beauty in your own opinion as much as you please, you cannot injure it in others; the Sun will shine though you wink, and you will be fair, whether you regard it or no. And, that Beauty will have Empire, how great, may appear by the many and mighty Conquests it makes; and in a Nation too where you have such numerous and considerable Rivals for that Dominion, some perhaps as powerful as any in the World, You, like the Goddess of Beauty, gain the Golden Ball, not from humble Mortals, <pb xml:id="ep000506-003-b"/>but your fellow Goddesses. How clear a Title you have to it, I shall not say, for I shall not please you by it, and I shall displease them: Nothing is so hateful to the conquered as to be upbraided with their misfortune: But certainly how mean an opinion soever you have, Heaven has none, of that Workmanship which he takes care to plant such Lights of Glory round about to shew: And though Nature might have discovered you to more advantage in a greater Empire, and by brighter Lights of Fortune, yet it proves how fond she was of that fair Idea which she was not able to conceal. They then who admire you, shew but their good Manners to Nature and Providence, in commending Nature's workmanship, and Providence's choice of a Favourite. But I fear the many Fair Ones, over whom you tryumph, will think themselves treated by this Discourse with too much insolence; however I am sure they will not grutch you the few Flowers that a poor Poet brings to strew in your way, especially when they come from Gardens warm'd by the lustre of your favour; and watered by Royal Bounty, which you caus'd to be shower'd upon it: moved to it by no Friends of mine, for I had few; by no Merits, for I had fewer; but only by your own excellent mind. How many attractives then have the following Poems to excuse their pressing into your presence? They attend you not only as born in general Vassalage to your Beauty, but as Creatures that received life from the concurrence of your Favour. I am now engaging in another Theme more safe than the former, I shall anger neither Sex by expatiating on an <pb xml:id="ep000506-004-a"/>Excellence which will contract You no envy, Your Patronage of Wit, that Province You may enjoy without any trouble from multitudes of Pretenders, You need not fear lest the ambitious Great Ones of either Sex invade you in it. No (Heaven be thanked) we live in an Age wherein men are content to want it, and to let others possess as much of it as they please: We need no Laws to secure us in the possession of that propriety. Witty men indeed do often quarrel with one another about it, because they know the value of it; others think it not worth contending for: Against it indeed they often strive, and they have reason, it treats ' emrudely, will have no friendship no acquaintance with them, will make no court to 'em, will scarcely lend 'em a little sense for common Conversation: This carriage I must confess is very provoking, especially when to men of Quality. They have cause to be angry with it, and to revenge themselves of it, as they often seek to do, by thrusting it out of their own, or any favour which might advantage it, setting up Fashions, Dresses, or any thing in the room of it. Your Grace then must both know and value the Jewel well, which you will take up and wear, when it is not only flung into the dirt by others, but trod upon. And wear it safely you may. Wit may dress you in all the lustre it has, and never endanger you a blasting from the fascinations of envious and malignant eyes. But though by ascribing this praise to You I displease not others, I fear I shall Your Grace, for by protecting a despised Quality You could not aim at praise: Besides praise being one of the vainest pleasures <pb xml:id="ep000506-004-b"/>of mankind, so excellent a mind cannot nor need not delight in it: You may find satisfaction enough at home, You need not go abroad for happiness. And we who place Your Statues in our Gardens, add no glory to You, only make our own Walks delighted in by our selves, and frequented by others, which else would lye neglected by both. I fix then Your Grace's Image at this Jewish Temple Gate, to render the Building sacred, nor can the Jews be angry with so beautiful a Profanation; and in guiding them to You, they are conducted like their Ancestors to repose and happiness, in the most fair and delightful part of the World. There I shall leave 'em, and retire to the contemplation of it, no moderate degree of happiness to one who is with so much devotion, </p>

        <p>THE world having been kind to these Plays, I would not be so ungrateful to requite any of my Judges by giving 'em offence, at least if I am so unhappy as to do it, I would not willingly let it pass without some Apologie. I have raised up an Hero in these Plays, which appears to some pious Criticks to be an evil Spirit, and makes 'em to have no good opinion of me for having such familiarity with him. There are several things in his part, and particularly in a Scene of dispute between him and his Mistress, in the third Act in the second Play, which I have been requested by many, and some very considerable persons not to print. To comply with 'em I have left out some few things, and would willingly have done all, but that on second thoughts I considered, the disarming my Hero was tacitely to acknowledge him a braver man than he is, and even yield him the better of the cause, I therefore thought it would be fairer dealing in the behalf of Truth, which needs no tricks, to expose him to all his advantages, so make the Victory of Truth the more glorious. And, Reader, if you will please to peruse that Scene carefully, you will find he is no such formidable person as imagined, and is indebted for <pb xml:id="ep000506-006-a"/>his reputation more to others opinion and partiality, than his own strength. He makes not one argument against Religion, and only evades those that are made for it; as any one of ordinary capacity may easily discover. Indeed his cause will admit of no more. I was loth then to cut off no less than a whole limb of a Wretch, who if he had more Hands than Briareus, had too few to fight against Heaven: And certainly whatever I am imagined to have, I shewed him no great kindness in sending him to storm so impregnable a Tower, from whence any Child might throw him down. He might easier with Hercules pull up Trees by the roots, than the notion of a Deity out of the Souls of Men. A Notion so ingrafted in us, it seems a part of us: Let Men strive never so much to get at liberty from it, any hair of their Heads will hold 'em. To conclude, if I cou'd have said more for Atheism, it argues I have no great kindness for a Cause I have betray'd; if I said all I cou'd, I hope no one will believe me of an opinion for which I have so little to say. </p>
        <p>This I think may suffice to recover my Reputation with these pious Criticks. Before I go home, I must visit a Lady or two by the way, to pacifie if I can their displeasure against this Scene also. They are angry not at Phraartes vigorous talk against Religion, but that so vigorous a Man should talk at all; they expected on his return from a Victory, something more pleasing than a Dispute. I confess they know much better than I what pleases their Sex; but at this present I was so unhappy as not to intend to please 'em. For having employ'd this and two Heroes more, for almost ten Acts, in nothing else but Love, I thought I had given 'em enough for reasonable Women, and might borrow this Hero to entertain the Men for a minute with a little reason, if it were but to give him some <pb xml:id="ep000506-006-b"/>respite to breath: but I find 'tis harder to give some Ladies enough than I thought it was. Besides, these Ladies may consider, if they please, Phraartes makes not Love to them, but Clarona, to whom a Discourse of Love was not so pleasing as to them, who care to hear nothing else; she loved to talk of Religion sometimes, which they never do it seems. She would fain convert Phraartes, which they would ne'er have troubled their heads about; he on the other hand had as great a zeal for her Body, and it concerned his Love as much to gain her to his opinions, as it did her piety to gain him to hers; that this very dispute is in pursuance of his Love, removing Religion, the main, only, and perpetual obstacle that lay in its way. </p>
        <p>But perhaps a man ought not to talk Reason in Love: I confess since Love has got the sole possession of the Stage, Reason has had little to do there; that effeminate Prince has softned and emasculated us the Vassals of the Stage. The Reason why the Off-springs of the Moderns are such short-liv'd things, is because the Genii that beget 'em are so given to women; they court nothing but the Ladies Favours, with them they waste all their strength, when as the lusty Ancients who fed on the wholesom Diet of good sense, and used themselves to the strong manly exercises of Reason, have been the Fathers of vigorous Issue, who have lived longer than the oldest Patriarchs, and are like to live as long as there are men. I who am a Friend both to Love and good Sense, endeavoured to reconcile 'em, and to bring Reason into favour, not with hopes to Rule; I desired only to procure him some little Office in the Stage, but I find it made an uproar, Love would not endure such an innovation, it threatned his settled Government; and Reason is not at all popular; <pb xml:id="ep000506-007-a"/>the Ladies knew not what to make of his Conversation, and the men generally sleep at it; that I see but little hopes of his preferment; which I am sorry for, since what future being I shall enjoy, I shall owe solely to him. Titus and Berenice as great Gallants as they have been in France, and as good a shew as they have made in England, have not such a substantial Fortune to maintain them for future Ages, but I am afraid will be reduced to depend on Phraartes for a livelihood. The whinings of Love, like a pretty new Tune, please for a while, but are soon laid aside, and never thought of more; the same Notes perhaps may help to compose another, but the old Air is altered, and for ever forgotten. </p>
        <p>But lest it should be imagined by this long defence, I suppose the Plays to be correct: I acknowledg there are many faults in design, which I had no leisure to mend; and many in Words and Phrases which I had not inclination. I love not too much carefulness in small things. To be exact in trifles is the business of a little Genius. They therefore who pride themselves much in their knowledg of words and phraseology, boast of knowing little; for those skills appear considerable to none, but them who know nothing. Something I intended also to say in vindication of my self from theft; some Persons accused me of stealing the parts of Titus and Berenice from the French Play written by Mr. Racine on the same subject; but a Gentleman having lately translated that Play, and exposed it to publick view on the Stage, has saved me that labour, and vindicated me better than I can my self. I wou'd not be asham'd to borrow, if my occasions compell'd me, from <pb xml:id="ep000506-007-b"/>any rich Author: But all Foreign Coin must be melted down, and receive a new Stamp, if not an addition of Metal, before it will pass current in England, and be judged Sterling: That borrowing or stealing from Mr. Racine could not have supplyed my occasions; but I am not so necessitous yet, nor have lived so prodigally on my small stock of Poetry, to be put so soon to those miserable shifts. </p>

            <l>A Poet lately by you sent to Hell </l>
            <l>Justly, as he acknowledg'd when he fell: </l>
            <l>His discontented Spirit walks around </l>
            <l>This Stage, where he receiv'd his mortal Wound. </l>
            <l>Seeking the reason why he walks, we find </l>

            <l>Not to build Tombs of honour to his Name, </l>
            <l>But ransome us his suff'ring friends from shame. </l>
            <l>Some thought because he had not on the Stage, </l>
            <l>Ranted it oft in huffing Equipage, </l>
            <l>Profusely lavish'd all his wealth away </l>
            <l>On some one lov'd and perhaps jilting Play, </l>

            <head>The EPILOGUE to the First Part. </head>
            <l>So, Heaven be thank'd, the Play is at an end, </l>
            <l>The best pretence it has to gain a friend. </l>
            <l>But this designs to draw another on, </l>
            <l>But you may damn 'em now both under one: </l>
            <l>Faults to deserve it every Critick sees, </l>
            <l>And they and we, both want no Enemies. </l>
            <l>First all you Wits, who for some secret Crime, </l>
            <l>Have taken up a pique against poor Rhime, </l>
            <l>And you at present are no little store; </l>
            <l>And next the Poets Foes, and they are more. </l>
            <l>Then all whom Priests and Women Saints displease, </l>
            <l>A small and trifling number&#8212; next to these, </l>
            <l>(If any such can be) the pious Jew; </l>
            <l>The frantique part of all our Nation too, </l>
            <l>Fanaticks, who'll be angry with us all, </l>
            <l>For ripping up their base Original; </l>
            <l>Shewing their Sires, the Pharisees, from whom </l>
            <l>They and their Cheats by long succession come: </l>
            <l>Whom they'r so like, the diff'rence duly priz'd, </l>
            <l>Fanaticks are but Jews uncircumciz'd. </l>
            <l>These Plays then must have luck to be long liv'd, </l>
            <l>None e're for damning better were contriv'd. </l>
            <l>What made the Poet on Jerus'lem fall? </l>
            <l>A Tale of Sodom wou'd ha' pleas'd you all. </l>
            <l>But he at shew and great Machines might aim, </l>
            <l>Fine Chairs to carry Poetry when lame, </l>
            <l>On Ropes instead of Raptures to relye, </l>
            <l>When the sense creeps, to make the Actors flye. </l>
            <l>These Tricks upon our Stage will never hit, </l>
            <l>Our Company is for the old way of Wit. </l>
            <l>Then Actors plaid on Nature's charge alone, </l>
            <l>And only Poets then could be undone; </l>
            <l>But now they lean so heavy on the Age, </l>
            <l>One Blockhead Poet falling breaks a Stage. </l>
            <l>Then Gentlemen for Plays so much distrest, </l>
            <l>Naked of shew, by Enemies opprest, </l>
            <l>The Poot begs the aid of all the brave; </l>
            <l>And that he some pretence to it may have, </l>
            <l>First for his Rhime he pardon does implore, </l>
            <l>And promises to ring those Chimes no more: </l>
            <l>Next for Jerus'lem, but with patience stay, </l>
            <l>And you shall see it burnt in the next Play: </l>
            <l>And last, to take away all sad Complaints, </l>
            <l>These Plays debauch our Women into Saints, </l>
            <l>Forgive it in the Plays, and we'll engage, </l>
            <l>They shall be Saints no where but on the Stage. </l>

            <l>Lord how we laugh at his poor nauseous Wise!&#8212; </l>
            <l>&#8212; I thought you were ador'd by such a one:&#8212; </l>
            <l>&#8212; I lov'd him first, but that Intrigue is done.&#8212; </l>
            <l>&#8212; Why did you part?&#8212; He was a Younger Brother; </l>
            <l>Besides, we grew a weary of each other. </l>
            <l>Thus brave are you, nor can you well forbear; </l>
            <l>Your Women charming, men most gallant are. </l>
            <l>With this small Beauty I might Servants have, </l>
            <l>Now I am free; but I your pardon crave, </l>
            <l>I never more will any Friendships make, </l>

            <l>All you forsaken slighted Mistresses, </l>
            <l>In mine, to hear your own complainings come; </l>

            <head>THE PROLOGUE. </head>
            <l>HOw! once again this fair and noble Shew! </l>
            <l>The Poet hopes you will good-natur'd grow: </l>
            <l>He shew'd before his Muse but to the wast; </l>
            <l>The Jewish Harlot hopes her danger's past, </l>
            <l>If she above cou'd ought to please you shew, </l>
            <l>You will implicitely like all below. </l>
            <l>The Fool is hardy who to write does dare; </l>
            <l>As strong in brain as Sampson in his hair </l>
            <l>He needs to be, who conquers when he writes, </l>
            <l>The Pit Philistines, Gall'ry Girgashites. </l>
            <l>But what Allies to aid him he does chuse? </l>
            <l>Priests, Women Saints, and Pharasaick Jews. </l>
            <l>You wicked Wits all Holy things despise, </l>
            <l>More charm in 'em then you perceive there lyes. </l>
            <l>Have you forgot since Wit was fool'd by Cant? </l>
            <l>The Hero ruin'd by the sneaking Saint? </l>
            <l>Saintship was making of a wicked face? </l>
            <l>And snuffling was a certain sign of Grace? </l>
            <l>Since by a fine distinction then in vogue, </l>
            <l>The inward Saint was only fac'd with Rogue; </l>
            <l>And men did subt'ly split themselves in two, </l>
            <l>And th'outward man did all the mischief do? </l>
            <l>If the good Brethren by a chance did fall, </l>
            <l>In that deep pit of sin you Wenching call, </l>
            <l>'Twas but the outward Knave that was unchast, </l>
            <l>And Sisters sinn'd but downward from the wast; </l>
            <l>The inward Maid as chast was as before, </l>
            <l>And th'upper parts did sanctifie the low'r. </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000506-042-a"/>
            <l>Thus they cou'd sin, and yet be Sisters too; </l>
            <l>Women are Wenches straight, who sin with you. </l>
            <l>Since those false Pharisees did works so great, </l>
            <l>Why may not true ones do a little cheat? </l>
            <l>Pervert your likings to these wretched Plays, </l>
            <l>And make you for a Wit the Scribler praise. </l>
            <l>Tub-preachers rid you all for years at least, </l>
            <l>Pray for an hour endure a Jewish Priest; </l>
            <l>So make the Stage successfull as the Tub, </l>
            <l>And Criticks may succeed to Beelzebub. </l>
