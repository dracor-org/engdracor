        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>REligious Broyles to such a height are grown, </l>
        <l>All the sweet sound of Poetry they drown. </l>
        <l>Were Orpheus here, his Lute might charm our Beasts, </l>
        <l>Our Mastiffs, not our Robble, or our Priests. </l>
        <l>Good Heaven! Sirs! are there no other ways </l>
        <l>To damn the Pope, but damning all our Plays? </l>
        <l>To our Religion 'tis no Praise at all, </l>
        <l>That, if our Wit must stand, our Faith must fall. </l>
        <l>All parties in a Play-House may agree, </l>
        <l>The Stage is priviledg'd from Piety. </l>
        <l>'Tis pleasant, Sirs, to see you fight and brawl </l>
        <l>About Religion, but have none at all. </l>
        <l>Most fiercely for the Road to Heav'n contend, </l>
        <l>But never care to reach the Journeys end. </l>
        <l>Though you lose Heaven, you will keep the Way, </l>
        <l>The Pope sha'n't have you, though the Devil may. </l>
        <l>These things such business for the Criticks find, </l>
        <l>They're not at leasure Poetry to mind, </l>
        <l>Well for the Poet 'tis they're so employ'd; </l>
        <l>Else this poor Work of his wou'd be destroy'd. </l>
        <l>For by his feeble Skill 'tis built alone, </l>
        <l>The Divine Shakespear did not lay one Stone. </l>
        <l>Besides this Tragedy a Rod will prove, </l>
        <l>To whip us for a Fault, we too much Love, </l>
        <l>And have for ages liv'd, call'd Civil Strife. </l>
        <l>The English Nation, like a Russian Wife, </l>
        <l>Is to a gentle Husband always curst, </l>
        <l>And loves him best, who uses her the worst. </l>
        <l>This Poet, (though perhaps in Colours faint) </l>
        <l>Those scurvy Joys does in all Postures Paint </l>
        <l>Fools take in pelting out each others Brains: </l>
        <l>A joy, for which this Nation oft takes pains. </l>
        <l>If any like the Ills he shews to day, </l>
        <l>Let them be damn'd and let them damn the Play. </l>
