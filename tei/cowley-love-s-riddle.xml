        <head>To the truly Worthy, and Noble, Sir KENELME DIGBIE Knight. </head>
        <l>THis latter Age, the Lees of Time, hath knowne, </l>
        <l>Few, that have made both Pallas arts their owne. </l>
        <l>But you, Great Sir, two Lawrels weare, and are </l>
        <l>Victorious in Peace, as well as War. </l>
        <l>Learning by right of Conquest is your owne, </l>
        <l>And every liberall Art your Captive growne. </l>
        <l>As if neglected Science (for it now </l>
        <l>Wants some defenders) fled for helpe to you. </l>
        <l>Whom I must follow, and let this for mee </l>
        <l>An earnest of my future service bee. </l>
        <l>Which I should feare to send you, did I know </l>
        <l>Your judgement onely, not your Candor too. </l>
        <l>For t'was a Worke, stolne (though you'le justly call </l>
        <l>This Play, as fond as those) from Cat, or Ball. </l>
        <l>Had it beene written since, I should, I feare, </l>
        <l>Scarse have abstain'd from a Philosopher. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000354-003-a"/>
        <l>Which by Tradition here is thought to bee </l>
        <l>A necessarie Part in Comedie. </l>
        <l>Nor need I tell you this; each line of it </l>
        <l>Betray's the Time and Place wherein t'was writ, </l>
        <l>And I could wish, that I might safely say </l>
        <l>To th' Reader, that t' was done but th' other day. </l>
        <l>Yet 'tis not stuff'd with names of Gods, hard words, </l>
        <l>Such as the Metamorphosis affords. </l>
        <l>Nor has't a part for Robinson, whom they </l>
        <l>At schoole, account essentiall to a Play. </l>
        <l>The stile is low, such as you'le easily take </l>
        <l>For what a Swaine might speake, and a Boy make. </l>
        <l>Take it, as early fruits, which rare appeare </l>
        <l>Though not halfe ripe, but worst of all the yeare. </l>
        <l>And if it please your tast, my Muse will say, </l>
        <l>The Birch which crown'd her then, is growne a Bay. </l>

          <l>For 'tis, said she, a Noblemans of Sicily, </l>
          <l>His name she would have spoke, but death permitted not. </l>

        <l>THe Author bid me tell you— 'faith, I have </l>
        <l>Forgot what 'twas; and I'me a very slave </l>
        <l>If I know what to say; but only this, </l>
        <l>Bee merry, that my counsell alwayes is. </l>
        <l>Let no grave man knit up his brow, and say, </l>
        <l>'Tis foolish: why? 'twas a Boy made the Play. </l>
        <l>Nor any yet of those that sit behind, </l>
        <l>Because he goes in Plush, be of his mind. </l>
        <l>Let none his Time, or his spent money grieve, </l>
        <l>Bee merry; Give me your hands, and I'le believe. </l>
        <l>Or if you will not, I'le goe in, and see, </l>
        <l>If I can turne the Authors mind, with mee </l>
        <l>To sing away the day, </l>
        <l>For 'tis but a folly </l>
        <l>To bee melancholy, </l>
        <l>Since that can't mend the Play. </l>
