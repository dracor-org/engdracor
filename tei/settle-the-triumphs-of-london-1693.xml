        <head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir William Ashurst, Knight, <hi>LORD MAYOR </hi>of the City of LONDON. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IN the present Solemnity of Your Lordship's Inauguration; never was Entry made to that fair Post of Honour, under more Expectations than from Your Lordship, nor more Confidence of seeing those Expectations answered. 'Tis not only the more unthinking Crowd of Homagers, those cheaper Lips, salute You; but Judgment and Sense have their Eyes fixt upon You, as fully satisfied that You bring those ample Qualifications for Our Metropolitan <hi>Royal Representative</hi>, that never Chapplet more fitted the Brow that wears it. </p>
        <p>And as no little Illustration to the eminent Figure that so much Worth must make, I may justly say of Your Lordship, That Authority as it never approach'd a Fairer, so it never entred under a more Prideless Roof than Your Lordship's. For never certainly was Power more affable, nor Command more familiar. Your State and Your Regalia wait You no farther than Your Chair; which more troublesome formal Attendants of Office are instantly dismist, and Your more genuine softer Train, all Your Sweetnesses of Conversation, and the condescending Graces of <hi>Courtesie, Goodness </hi>and Humanity are called in as Your gentler and nearer Menials. And to all these there runs that Bravery of Spirit through You; a Glory so particularly Your own, that in all the Knees that bend before You, You give an occasion to Thank wherethey Pray. Your Lordships more generous Goodness is not worshipt by empty Gazers only, but by a more sensible Zeal and Devotion. But not to instance the acknowledgments of Duty and Gratitude, the Addresses and Panegyricks You receive where You have bestowed Smiles and showr'd Favours: Those are no more than the payment <pb xml:id="ep000722-003-a"/>of Debts that are owing You; and Greatness and Power every day meet such Homage. No, my Lord, Your Lordship's Virtue soars a pitch yet higher, a Virtue so attractive, as creates You Votaries at a much farther distance: For Your Lordship has reacht a Character so universally Grateful, that You are every where honoured, even where you never obliged. </p>
        <p>And indeed 'tis no more than the Common Justice of mankind to pay that Esteem to so noble and <hi>publick spirited </hi>a Principle as Your Lordship's; Your Lordship, that think Your self made for the World, as well as the World for You, and consequently (not like too many rising Favourites of Fortune that look no higher than home; to be Rich to themselves, and Poor to all mankind besides,) You make it an equal, if not larger part of Your Ambition to hoard a <hi>fair Name </hi>as well as a <hi>fair Mass </hi>to leave behind You. </p>
        <p>But in all Your Personal Accomplishments to furnish out the Magistrate, Your Lordships innate Gallantry and Honour are in a high measure owing to Your <hi>Generous Extract</hi>, and as <hi>Generous Education</hi>, Derivative from Your Veins, and suckt in from Your Cradle: Your Lordship that possibly has that extraordinary Advantage, that Additional Weight in your Scale, a Blazon so rare, or at least not in every City Coat, as to descend from that fair Original, the Ashursts of Ashurst, a Family that brought in the Gentility in their Blood, and the <hi>Normand Fleur de Lis's </hi>in their Scutcheon, with the First Great William; and have ever since continued in that unbroken Chain both of Fortune and Reputation, as has trod as near the Heels of Nobility as any First Rank Gentry in England. And as one Honorable Derivative more of Your Lordship's, Your Ancestors have been constant Assertors and Champions of Religion and Virtue, Witness Your Lordship's Uncle in the Reign of King Charles the First, who then <hi>High Sheriff </hi>of Lancashire, had the hardy Christian Courage as to lay a Criminal by the Heels for the violation of the Sabbath day, though a Transgressor in that kind and at that time within the Verge of Priviledge, under the Umbrage and Protection of the then newly publisht <hi>Metropolitan Canterbury License </hi>and Authority. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000722-003-b"/>
        <p>But whilst my weak Oratory, the meanest Trumpet of a Renown so conspicuous, is only repeating of what all Tongues are already filled with; I beseech You to believe, That this Epistle is not addrest to the Right Honourable Your Lordship; but the <hi>Right Worthy</hi>, Sir William; not any tributary Devoir to the Greatness You wear for a Year, but the great Soul You wear always. For as Your Lordship's present Dignity is not presented You as a Gift, but paid You as a Reward; under that consideration, to level at the true Object of our Veneration, we must look beyond the Robe You wear, to the Merit that put it on. For the Foundation of <hi>True Honour</hi>, is like that of the Pyramide: The Basis is always larger than the Pinnacle that Crowns it. 'Tis in that capacity, as both an Honour to the City, and an Ornament to Your Country, I Congratulate Your Lordship's Accession to Your <hi>Praetorian Chair</hi>, and our proud Metropolis's Happiness in such a Member, and such a Magistrate, being with no little Pride, </p>

        <head>TO THE HONOURABLE COMPANY OF Merchant-Taylors. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Gentlemen, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHEN I address to You as Merchant-Taylors, that very Name alone, without my particular Survey of the collected Body of so Honourable a Company, is enough to take up no little part both of my Speculation and Veneration. For do we visit the utmost Reach and Extents of Land and Sea: make the very boundless Ocean a Tributary to the narrower Thames, and bring home the Wealth of the Universe to our own Doors? Who but the Merchant is that commission'd Purveyour, and travelling Treasurer! What's the whole Mass and Wealth of Ransact Nature, but his rich Hoard! The very Jemms of Crowns and Robes of Kings, Their Ermyn, and their Purple, their Pearls, and their Rubies, are all but his Richer Cargo. Do the glittering Pallaces of Monarchs in all their Lustre and Magnificence so dazle our weak Eyes? Their Splendor is no more than the Oar refined from the Merchants Mint; and their Embroydery but his Drapery; being all first the Riches of His Wooden Walls, before they are the Ornaments of their Marble Roofs. </p>
        <p>What is the Merchant but the Surrounder and Circler of the spacious Globe, that draws the only Lines of Communication betwixt the Conversing and Commercing Regions of the Earth. Were it not for the Merchant, we had lived altogether in an unsociable World: Our very next Neighbourhood had been a downright Terra-Incognita to us; whilst pent up in their own narrower untraffiking Precincts, whole Kingdoms <pb xml:id="ep000722-004-b"/>and Nations had been little less than a larger sort of Cloysters and Cells. Then the product of our own Glebe only must have furnisht both our Kitchin and our Wardrobe. Nay our very Monarchs themselves must have been contented to have taken up with a homlier mettald Crown, possibly such another as the Isle of Mann's Diadem; and their very Coronation Mantle, (though no Disparagement to our own native Growth, the Fleece of the Sheep that buys the Jewels of the Crown) instead of the richer Orient Embroydery, the Silkworms softer Spinstry, and the Ermins whiter Down, must at highest have reacht but to Wooll and Lambskins. Thus the <hi>Pavilion Royal </hi>is but justly a part of the Merchant-Taylors Scutcheon: For whilst the Imperial Hero marches to the Field, and sweats in Arms all Day; he sleeps at Night under Your Umbrage, whilst not only his Tent of War, but his Canopy of Peace is all Your own. </p>
        <p>Thus the Great Columbus in his Discovery of a new World, only open'd a new Door to the Merchants Glory; whilst after their long Addresses and Visits to their <hi>European, Asian</hi>, and African three old Mistresses; they had found out a new fair American Sister to pay their new Court and Devoirs to; and to plume themselves in the Wealth of the rich Dowr She brought them. </p>
        <p>We may justly rank the whole Industry of mankind under these two Classes, That of the Husbandman, and this of the Merchant. And indeed there's so far an Allyance and proportion betwixt both their Toyls and Labours, that 'tis all but the <hi>Work of the Plough</hi>: His that turns up the Glebe of the Earth, and Yours Your Keele that ploughs the Main. And as the Fruits of Bountiful Nature are his Harvest; So the Riches of it are Yours: Only with this Difference between You, That the Husbandman is but the Subminister or Underfactor of the Merchant. The sweat of His Brow gets the Bread: But Your Gold pays that sweat; and indeed drives both Plough and Ploughman </p>
        <p>Amongst the several Pageants of the Day, all suited to the Lustre and Renown of Your Honourable Foundation, the Fair Minerva in both her Capacities, viz. the Goddess of Arts and Arms, is but the true Emblem and Portrait of Your Glory. For Arts are all so intirely Your own, that You resemble the Ocean, on which You Trade. For as into that all the Lesser Rivers flow: So the Toyls and Industry of the whole Land, from the Spinstry of the Cottage, to the Loom of the Burgh, and the Woof <pb xml:id="ep000722-005-a"/>of the City, all Center in the Merchant. And as the Wealth and Improvements of Peace are so justly Yours, no less are the Prowess and Strength of Arms Your own too. For as the Nerves and Sinews of Trade are the Life and Soul of War; 'Tis only as the Merchant leads the Battle moves. </p>
        <p>And now Gentlemen, having brought You thus far in Your fair Chace of Honour, here Ile leave You, and heartily wish, so may You all unanimously lead, and make the Battle so successfully move; That England may live to see her long Effeminacy shook off: and have yet a Race of the Third Edward and Fifth Henry Boys, as may still carry Terror to the too powerful neighbouring Lillies, and raise up the Heads of her own Royal Lyons. </p>

On the most Noble and Greatest Seate of this Structure sits Minerva, the Goddess in Chief of all the Arts and Sciences, a person of a Majestick Aspect, attir'd with long thick bright curld Hair, on her Head a Silver Head-peice, graced with a high flourishing Plume of Feathers consisting of divers Falls; she is attired in Rich Robe of Gold surfled with Silver, and over all a Noble Scarf of Carnation silk fringed with Gold, with a Crimson Mantle laid with Ermyn. In one Hand she bears a Bannor of the Companies Arms, in the other a Sheild of the Cities Arms. On a Descent beneath her are placed three Graces, <hi>viz. Vigilance, Diligence</hi>, and Labour, being exprest by the Kettle Drums and Trumpets. In the Front of these, remote from the former, sits a Figure personating Time, who holds the Reins of these two stately Camels excellently carved and gilded, and painted in equal proportion to the Life, with Trappings of Crimson and Silver, and Crimson Bridles, as being the supporters of the Honourable Company of Merchant-Taylors Arms. This Figure of Time is so order'd to hold the Reins of this Triumphant Chariot, as intimating the Antiquity of this Honourable Company, the Records of their Magnificence and Glory, having lasted so many long Ages past, and whose Chariot shall still drive on till Time it self shall finish. On the Backs of the two Camels are seated, or mounted <pb n="15" xml:id="ep000722-008-b"/>two sweat young Yrinces, a Negro and a Pawny, the one an Asian, and the other an African, in their Richest Robes, attired in the most Princely Dress of those Countries, with Coronets on their Heads beset with plumes of variety of diverse coloured Feathers. In their Right Hands they bear two displaid Banners, one the Cities, the other the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor intimating their Fealty and Submission to the Heroick Monarch of <hi>Great Britain</hi>, the sole Soveraign of the Sea, and so far Lord of the World from Our British Communion and Traffick in the Richest Asian and African Commerce, &amp;c. And likewise implying their Ambition to hold an amicable Correspondence with this Renown'd City. Moreover, upon this Stage are placed three Figures representing the Seasons of the Day, viz. Morning, Noon, and Evening; attired in their proper Habits, with gilded Banners suitable to 'em all, intimating that Vigilence, Diligence and Labour are the Duties of every Hour of Life: and at each Corner is four Golden Cypress Trees. His Lorship is saluted by Minerva in this Speech, &amp;c. </p>

This Ship is laden with Cloth, Silk and Stuffs of all sorts, as representing the Traffick in which His Lordship deals into Foraign Countries. This stately Vessel bears all her Guns, with Antients and Pendants, Streamers, Flaggs Standarts, Tackling, Braces, Bowls, Cables, Anchors, Sayls and Cordages, and all sort of Rigging appertaining to a Merchant-Man of that Burden, being richly gilded and painted with all her Waste Cloaths. </p>
        <p>On board this Ship are a Captain and his Mate, a Bosewain and Mariner, each man at work, some at the main Tack, others at the main Braces, others the Bowlings, some climbing up to the Main-top, others siting cross the Yard-Arms. Others with Quarter Canns drinking the King and Queens Health; the Lord Mayors, and the Honourable Companies, with Guns fireing, Shouts, Huzahs and Acclamations, as the Expressions of their Joy for his Lordship's Inauguration, and their Dutiful salutes to welcome him to the Chair, with Songs and Trumpets sounding, proper to the Action and the Honour of the Merchant-Taylors. </p>
        <p>The Captain with his Crew placing themselves on the Quarter-Deck, drest in Indian silks, with rich Fur Caps, attired like Sea-faring men; the Bosewain having given his signal by a whistle, and commanded silence, the Syrens being placed in the Sea leave off their melodious Musick, and display their Bannors whilst the Captain accosts his Lordship. </p>
