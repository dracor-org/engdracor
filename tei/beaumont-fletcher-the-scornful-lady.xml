Porredge is poyson, they hate a kitchen as they hate a counter, and show em but a Fetherbed they swound. Ale is their eating, and their drinking surely, which keeps their bodies cleere, &amp; soluble. Bread is a binder, and for that abolisht euen in their ale, whose lost roome fills an apple, which is more ayre, and of subtiller Nature. The rest they take, is little, and that little, as little easie: For like strict men of order, they doe correct their bodies with a bench, or a poore stubborne table; if a chimney offer it self with some few broken rushes, they are in downe: when they are sick, that's drunke, they may haue fresh shaw, else they doe despise these worldly pamperings. For their poore apparrell, tis worne out to the dyet; new they seeke none, and if a man should offer, they are angry: scarse to be reconcyl'd againe with him: you shall not heare em aske one a cast doublet, once in a yeare, which is a modesty befitting my poore friends: you see their Wardrope, though slender, competent: For shirts I take it, they are things worne out of their remembrance. Lowsie they will be, when they list, and Mangie, which showes a fine variety: and then to cure em, a Tanners lymepit, which is little charge, two dogs, and these; these two may be cur'd for three pence. </p>
