        <p>I Did suffer at the first some contention within me, and looking upon my self, was inclined to stifle my ambitious thoughts in this Dedication; but when some time, and a happy conversation, had preferred me to more acquaintance with you, (which was more argument to me, than the fame I had heard of your reputation, with the most temperate and ingenious men) I found you not only an excellent Judge, but a good Man: at this my modesty took full encouragement, to make this offering, which as I conceive to be the best of my flock, I knew not a better Altar whereon to make it a sacrifice, with this protestation, that it comes (and that is it only, which makes all devotions <pb xml:id="ep000818-003-a"/>acceptable) from the heart, and your candid acceptance will bind me with all my services, and remembrance, to merit a reception with you, in the quality and honour of, </p>

          <l>THe Cardinal, cause we express no scene, </l>
          <l>We doe believe most of you Gentlemen </l>
          <l>Are at this hour in France, and busie there, </l>
          <l>Though you vouchsafe to lend your bodies here; </l>
          <l>But keep your fancy active, till you know </l>
          <l>By th' progress of our Play, 'tis nothing so; </l>
          <l>A Poets art is to lead on your thought </l>
          <l>Through subtle paths and workings of a plot, </l>
          <l>And where your expectation does not thrive, </l>
          <l>If things fall better, yet you may forgive; </l>
          <l>I will say nothing positive, you may </l>
          <l>Think what you please, we call it but a Play, </l>
          <l>Whether the comick Muse, or Ladies love, </l>
          <l>Romance, or direfull Tragedy it prove, </l>
          <l>The Bill determines not; and would you be </l>
          <l>Perswaded, I would have't a Comedie, </l>
          <l>For all the purple in the name, and state </l>
          <l>Of him that owns it; but 'tis left to fate; </l>
          <l>Yet I will tell you e'r you see it plaid, </l>
          <l>What the Author, and he blusht too, when he said </l>
          <l>(Comparing with his own for 't had been pride </l>
          <l>He thought, to build his wit a Pyramyde. </l>
          <l>Vpon anothers wounded Fame,) this Play </l>
          <l>Might rivall with his best, and dar'd to say </l>

        <lg>
          <l>AS Fate, which doth all human matters sway, </l>
          <l>Makes proudest things grow up into decay; </l>
          <l>And when they are to envyed greatness grown, </l>
          <l>She wantonly falls off, and throws them down: </l>
          <l>So, when our English Dramma was at hight, </l>
          <l>And shin'd, and rul'd with Majesty and might, </l>
          <l>A sudden whirlwind threw it from it seat, </l>
          <l>Deflowr'd the Groves, and quench'd the Muses heat. </l>
          <l>Yet as in Saints, and Martyr'd bodies, when </l>
          <l>They cannot call their blessed Souls agen </l>
          <l>To earth; Reliques, and ashes men preserve, </l>
          <l>And think they do, but what, blest they deserve: </l>
          <l>So I, by my devotion led, aspire </l>
          <l>To keep alive your noble Vestal fire, </l>
          <l>Honour this piece, which shews, Sir, you have been </l>
          <l>The last supporter of the dying Scene; </l>
          <l>And though I do not tell you, how you dress </l>
          <l>Virtue in gloryes, and bold vice depress; </l>
          <l>Nor celebrate your lovely Dutchess fall, </l>
          <l>Or the just ruine of your Cardinal; </l>
          <l>Yet this I dare assert, when men have nam'd </l>
          <l>Iohnson (the Nations Laureat,) the fam'd </l>
          <l>Beaumont, and Fletcher, he, that wo'not see </l>
