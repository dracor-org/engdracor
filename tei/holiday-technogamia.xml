Ile giue them leaue to vse their Dead Precepts, but if they once come to liuely Examples, Ile vndertake my Selfe to conuince their best Experience. Poeta's loue indeed of late is much alienated from me, but as long I loue him, Ile speake in his defence; did you see how Polites did onely speake an Accusation against him? and Ethicus Abuse his froward Age; and Oeconoma Chafe out her weake coniecture? and then, (when they had rather shewed the Weaknesse of their Age; then the Strength of their Reason,) flung away, as if their Obiections could not be Answered, because they would not Heare an Answere. I would enquire of Polites (if my Ancestors haue not mis-inform'd mee in Antiquitie) whether in the Time of Herodotus, and after that, of Zenophon (and since of many others) there has not bin a like coniunction to Poeta's and Historia's; and whether your chiefest Common-wealths-men, either of Former times as Plato; or of Later, as the great Solon of the Utopian Common-wealth, haue not made a Poeticall inuention their chiefest glorie? but there is no discoursing with Age; especially, when it is possessed with a peruerse preiudice. </p>

So, when they laught, they obseru'd three more by Ha, ha, ho. These being first ioyn'd together, and afterwards variously intermixt, were the first harmonie in voice; which being repeated vnto grieued mindes, were as it were a prettie deluding of their sorrowes; and these by obseruation were afterwards reduc'd to instrument— </p>

Away they went, and none but a little boy was left in the roome to tend the Gentleman, when vpon a suddaine there comes mee by, a Bag-pipe-player, at the sound of whose Pipe the Gentleman suddainely arose, leapes about the Chamber, beates his head against the wall, so long, till at last he had broke his face in diuers places that the bloud gushed out; vpon the effusion of which melancholy bloud, that had corrupted his braine and phantasie, the Gentlemans Hornes were beaten off against the wall, and the Gentlewoman became as honest a woman after that time, as any in Europe. </p>

It is like a picture, and yet is no picture,— that's manifest.

              <p>I Doe finde my selfe at this present affected with that which should not touch a good Magistrate, an vnwillingnesse to doe Iustice: yet I professe it proceeds not from a desire to bee <pb xml:id="ep000082-045-a"/>iniurious, but mercifull; not for an ill-will to either, but a loue to both. Whilest heretofore, I vnderstood of this dissention, as I was somewhat cast downe with sorrow, so I was raised with an hope of happie reconcilement, but now that hope also which before was the cause of an vncertaine ioy, is become the ground of my most certaine griefe; and the rather to see the state of our most blessed Commonwealth (which the gods haue decreed shall be eternall, if our selues hinder not) to be thus torne with our ciuill Discords. You are not ignorant of the miraculous meanes which the gods haue vs'd in raysing vs to this greatnesse: not by riches, but pouertie; not by plentie, but want; that what to others has beene the occasion of disgrace, has to vs beene the meanes of our present honour: It is the obseruation of the Grecians, Tacitus, and truest Oracle of Greece, Thucidides, that the Athenians Common-wealth was not rays'd to that glorie (like the rest of Greece) by the fruitfulnesse but barrennesse of the soyle: for which cause whilest the Inhabitants liu'd secure from the inuasion of Borderers, others growing rich, were at last consum'd by their owne dissentions: so that for the auoyding of publike disturbance, when any were afflicted, they retyred to the Athenians, with what they had left, before all were lost; who as they did partake of the Athenians securitie, so mutually offer'd to the Athenians the participation of their wealth: the like I may say of our present estate; we haue not sought vnto others; yet who haue not sought to vs? we had nothing, yet what want we, vnlesse it be a moderation of our felicitie? All other Mechanicke faculties, of whatsoeuer Corporations, haue they not forsooke themselues to retyre to vs? and yeelded vp their estates, which they thought vnhappie, to receiue them as an happinesse from our bountie? I speake not these things vnto you as an instructer, but a remembrancer: Not to impose on you a new beliefe beyond your experience, but to imprint in your mindes a iust consideration of your dangerous contention.

              <p>Nay, Logicus, you haue little reason to say so, I can tel you: for if we take a view of the most illustrious Age, that euer the world inioy'd, which I thinke to be the time of the twelue Romane Caesars; wherein Armes and Learning were at their height, you may obserue Poetrie to haue beene most famous, embraced by Emperours, admired by all who laboured to haue their names amongst the Learned. But for Logicians, alas, (I must speake the truth) as their names were vnknowne, so were their endeuours buried in obscuritie: Indeede those times were thriftie, and actiue: but these, out of a wanton softnesse of a daintie sloth, doe onely spinne out these Spider-webs of curiositie; and it hath beene often my meditation, to haue an amputation of such Excrescencies, and to cause that our youth which is to bee instructed for future vse, should not consume the strength of their wits, in an iniurious labour of fruitlesse vanities. I doe not denie a iust knowledge of your facultie, to be most necessarie, and our selues thereinto haue an aduantage of former times: but yet, alas! how many thousand famous Oratours haue there beene without Logicke? how many eternall Poets without Logicke? whose diuine eloquence could speake beyond all Logicke; without all Logicke. <stage xml:id="ep000082-e127350">Enter MVSICA. </stage>

There was an Astronomia that I once had in cure before now, and she was of the very same constitution, had the like disease, and the like turning in her head; now she dyed, and afterward we made a dissection in her head, to see what was the disaffection of her braine, which when we had done, we found all her braines turn'd to a matter much like cleere Ielly, or a Crystalline Orbe: but I hope all such suspicions of this Astronomia are Fables— but stay— what's the rellish of her vrine? (hee tastes it)— Pah, naught, naught: oh, who would be a Physician to taste these things? 'tis worse then to be a Salt-peeterman, and digge in a Priuie-house— but what smell has it? (he smels to it.) Foh, worse, worse, I cannot endure it, [he throwes away the Vrinall, and breakes it.] Astronomia's of a faire complexion her selfe, I wonder that her Vrine should be so darke; 'tis of the colour of a Cloud. Well, I see shee's verie corrupt within, and I feare 'tis this Astrologia has powder'd her; to giue her a Potion at the mouth will not doe much good; for 'twill be so long in descending, that the power of it will bee much debilitated; I conclude then, it must bee a Clyster, a Clyster; and so Ile in, to administer it: well, if I scape this Scowring cleanly; Ile neuer come in the like Pickle againe, whil'st I breathe. <stage xml:id="ep000082-e127720">Exit Medicus. </stage>

              <p>Why, Sir, besides excellent furres we had, we had also hot waters to preserue our heate within: but at last wee were come so farre, that wee were faine to come out of our <pb xml:id="ep000082-050-a"/>ship vpon the ice, and then the Magician being also an exquisite Geometrician, got the ship vpon the Ice, and then made wheeles for it, and an artificiall Engine to make it goe of it selfe; you may see proportionally the like deuice in your Puppets that will goe and turne of themselues. The ice then being smooth, the ship went forward of its owne accord, till wee found our selues to haue past the Articke circle twenty three degrees full. Then were we halfe a degree iust from the Pole: there we met with a most furious sea, that scornes to yeeld to the vsurping cold; when the Geometrician takes me off the wheeles, and forth we lanched, and so sail'd till wee came to haue the Pole it selfe for our Zenith; and then we beheld a dreadfull rocke. </p>

We went in, and being entred, there were two paire of staires, the one descending, the other ascending: for we found the piller to be hollow, and our sight could not discouer without-side how high it was: wee went downe wards some dozen or twenty staires, where wee heard a most hideous noise, that our hearts failing vs we came vp againe. </p>

This piller doubtles we coniectur'd to be the Pole, and the way to heauen; and the staires that descended, the way to hell, and to the other Pole.

Yeeld Rhetorica, yeeld, let Physica intreate thee. </p>

Now my counsell shall be, that you, Ethicus, and Oeconoma, would vouchsafe to giue good aduice to Poeta and Historia: and you, honour'd Physica, to your happy children Geographus and Astronomia: for Grammaticus and Rhetorica their Tongues will alwayes agree, and then I thinke they can hardly fall out: and for Geometres and Arithmetica, I likewise know they will be very Regular, and now all's compos'd; and yet, now I think on't, it is not, for yonder Melancholico stands sad, and alone, amongst all these matches: and yet it is better thought on; yonder's Musica too: now surely a fit match; but they shal be henceforth for their ingenuitie, both exempt from seruitude, and made ioynt fellowes with our selues. </p>

        <l>IVdicious Hearers, you <stage xml:id="ep000082-e132040">When the Epilogue was about to be spoken, the pure Arts were ascended to Heauen, and appeared (as in the Prologue) till the Epilogue was ended, and then the Heauen closed .</stage>that apprehend </l>
        <l>What taske it is to make the Artes descend </l>
        <l>To Popular cares; you whose pure iudgement knowes, </l>
        <l>How to distinguish betweene Arte and Showes; </l>
        <l>Our Author now salutes. And does compare </l>
        <l>His Comedie vnto his Theater; </l>
        <l>Where some play Artes, some Humors; and thus fits </l>
        <l>Himselfe, to all variety of wits. </l>
        <l>If any yet shall aske why he does bring </l>
        <l>A Hobby-horse, or such a nimble thing </l>
        <l>To raise an Ignorant laugh: It was his Art </l>
        <l>That said, This will expresse Phantastes part; </l>
        <l>And thus he Scorn'd and Us'd it. He did feare </l>
        <l>Indeed, there was a People too, eu'n Here. </l>
        <l>Therefore his Courteous Comedie did speake </l>
        <l>And act Some things to satisfie the Weake </l>
        <l>Shee Academickes; and to make Them smile, </l>
        <l>Brought in Impostors, Gypsies, and such vile </l>
        <l>Pedlars of Artes: yet does he not from These </l>
        <l>Hope for a Tin-foil'd glory: or so please </l>
        <l>Himselfe, by a Reflection. Here to stay, </l>
        <l>And in a Looking glasse behold his play; </l>
        <l>Nor does he promise to himselfe, in high </l>
        <l>Conceit, a Sawcy Immortalitie. </l>
        <l>Yet This he sayes: Let no man iudge his Arts, </l>
        <l>But he that first can iudge of All the Artes. </l>
        <l>But I forget one message; Fate of life! </l>
        <l>Poore Melancholico has lost his wife. </l>
        <l>For whilst, within, he on the Humours tended, </l>
        <l>Pure Musike with the Artes to Heau'n ascended. </l>
        <l>Which makes the poore man sad, that now hee's growne </l>
        <l>Into a Dump, thus to be left Alone. </l>
        <l>Yet since he cannot call Her backe againe, </l>
        <l>He does intreat this grace he may obtaine; </l>
        <l>That You would, to repaire his Marriage bands, </l>
