        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>
          <hi>LVcius Tarquinius </hi>(for his excessiue pride surnamed Superbus) after he had caused his own father in law <hi>Seruius Tullius </hi>to be cruelly murthered, and contrary to the Romane lawes and customes, not requiring or staying for the peoples suffrages, had possessed himselfe of the kingdome: went accompanied with his sonnes and other noble men of Rome to besiege Ardea; during which siege, the principall men of the Army meeting one euening at the Tent of <hi>Sextus Tarquinius</hi>, the Kings sonne, in their discourses after supper, euery one commended the vertues of his owne wife: among whom Colatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife Lucretia. In that pleasant humor they alposted to Rome, and intending by their secret and sodaine arriuall, to make triall of that which euery one had before auouched, onely Colatinus finds his wife (though it were late in the night) spinning amongst her maids, the other Ladies were all found dancing and reuelling, or in seuerall disports. Whereupon the Noble men yeelded Colatinus the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time <hi>Sextus Tarquinius </hi>being enflamed with <pb xml:id="ep000844-003-b"/>Lucreces beauty, yet smothering his passions for the present, departed with the rest backe to the Campe, from whence he shortly after priuily withdrew himselfe, and was (according to his state) royally entertained and lodged by Lucrece at Colatium. The same night, he trecherously stealeth into her Chamber, violently rauisht her, and early in the morning speedeth away. Lucrece in this lamentable plight, hastely dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father, another to the Campe for Colatine. They came, the one accompanied with <hi>Iunius Brutus</hi>, the other with <hi>Publius Valerius</hi>: and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habite, demanded the cause of her sorrow. She first taking an oath of them for her reuenge, reuealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and withall suddenly stabbed her selfe. Which done with one consent, they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the Tarquins: and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed: with a bitter inuectiue against the tyranny of the King, wherewith the people were so mooued with one consent, and a generall acclamation, that the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state gouernment changed from Kings to Consuls. </p>

          <l>That two red fires in both their faces blazed, </l>

          <l>Before the which is drawne the power of Greece, </l>
          <l>For Hellens rape the citie to destroy, </l>
          <l>Threatning cloud-kissing Illion with annoy; </l>
          <l>Which the conceipted Painter drew so proud, </l>

          <l>The red bloud reekd to shew the painters strife, </l>

          <l>Pale couards marching on with trembling paces, </l>

          <l>In speach it seemd his beard, al <hi>siluer white</hi>, </l>
          <l>Wag'd vp and downe, and from his lips did flie </l>

          <l>All ioyntly listning, but with seuerall graces, </l>
          <l>As if some Mermaid did their eares intise, </l>
          <l>Some high, some low, the painter was so nise. </l>
          <l>The scalpes of many almost hid behind, </l>

          <l>To this well painted peece is Lucrece come, </l>

          <l>Staring on Priams wounds with her old eyes, </l>
          <l>Which bleeding vnder Pirrhus proud foot lies. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>In her the Painter had annotimiz'd </l>

          <pb xml:id="ep000844-026-b"/>
          <l>Her cheeks with chops and wrinckles were disguiz'd, </l>

          <l>Her blew bloud chang'd to black in euery vain, </l>
          <l>Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed </l>
          <l>Shew'd life imprison'd in a body dead. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>On this sad shadow Lucrece spends <hi>her cies</hi>, </l>

          <l>The Painter was no God to lend her those; </l>
          <l>And therefore Lucrece sweares he did her wrong, </l>
          <l>To giue her so much griefe, and not a tong. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>Poore instrument (quoth she) without a sound, </l>
          <l>Ile tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue: </l>
          <l>And drop sweet balme in Priams painted wound, </l>
          <l>And raile on Pirrhus that hath done him wrong, </l>
          <l>And with my teares quench Troy that burns so long: </l>
          <l>And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes </l>

          <l>This lode of wrath, that burning Troy doth beare: </l>
          <l>Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here. </l>
          <l>And here in Troy for trespasse of thine eye, </l>

          <l>Once set on ringing, with his owne waight goes, </l>
          <l>Then little strength rings out the dolefull knell: </l>

          <l>To penseld pensiuenesse, and colour'd sorrow, </l>
          <l>She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>She throwes her eies about the painted round, </l>
          <l>And who she finds forlorne she doth lament: </l>
          <l>At last shee sees wretched image bound, </l>

          <l>His face though full of cares, yet shew'd content, </l>
          <l>Onward to Troy with these blunt swaines he goes, </l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>In him the painter labour'd with his skill </l>

        <lg>
          <l>The well-skild workman this mild Image drew </l>
          <l>For periur'd Sinon, whose inchanting storie </l>
          <l>The credulous old Priam after slew. </l>
          <l>Whose words like <hi>wild fire </hi>burnt the shining glorie </l>
          <l>Of rich built Illion, that the skies were sorie, </l>
          <l>And little starres shot from their fixed places, </l>

        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>This picture she aduisedly perusd, </l>
          <l>And chide the Painter for his woundrous skill: </l>
          <l>Saying, some shape in Sinons was abusd, </l>
          <l>So faire a forme lodg'd not a mind so ill, </l>
          <l>And still on him she gaz'd, and gazing still </l>
          <l>Such signes of truth in his plaine face she spied, </l>
          <l>That she concluds, the picture was belied. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>It cannot be (quoth she) that so much guile, </l>
          <l>(She would haue said) can lurke in such a Looke: </l>
          <l>But Tarquins shape, came in her minde the while. </l>
          <l>And from her tongue, can lurke, from cannot, tooke </l>

          <l>So sober sad, so weary and so milde, </l>
          <l>(As if with griefe or trauaile he had fainted,) </l>

          <l>With outward honestie, but yet defil'd </l>
          <l>With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish, </l>

          <pb xml:id="ep000844-028-a"/>
          <l>For euery teare he fals, a Troyan bleeds: </l>

        <lg>
          <l>Such Diuels steale effects from lightlesse hell, </l>

          <l>These contraries such vnitie do hold, </l>
          <l>Onely to flatter fooles and make them bold: </l>
          <l>So Priams trust false Sinons teares doth flatter </l>

        </lg>

        <lg>
          <l>Thus ebs and flowes the currant of her sorrow, </l>

          <l>To rouse our <hi>Roman Gods </hi>with inuocations, </l>
          <l>That they will suffer these abhominations, </l>
          <l>(Since Rome her selfe in them doth stand disgraced) </l>
          <l>By our strong arms from forth her faire streets chased. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Now by the Capitoll that we adore, </l>
          <l>And by this <hi>chast blood </hi>so vniustly stained, </l>
          <l>By heauens faire sun that breeds the fat earths store </l>
          <l>By all our <hi>country rites </hi>in Rome maintained, </l>
          <l>And by chast Lucrece soule that late complained </l>
          <l>Her wrongs to vs, and by this <hi>bloudy knife</hi>, </l>
          <l>We will reuenge the death of this true wife. </l>

          <l>This said, he stroke his hand vpon his breast, </l>
          <l>And kist the fatall knife to end his vow: </l>
          <l>And to his protestation vrg'd the rest, </l>
          <l>Who wondring at him did his words allow: </l>
          <l>Then ioyntly to the ground their knees they bow, </l>
          <l>And that deepe vow which Brutus made before </l>

          <l>He doth againe repeat, and that they swore. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>When they had sworne to this aduised doome, </l>
          <l>They did conclude to beare dead Lucrece thence </l>
          <l>To shew the bleeding body through out Rome, </l>
          <l>And so to publish Tarquins foule offence; </l>
          <l>Which being done, with speedy diligence </l>
          <l>The Romains plausibly did giue consent, </l>
          <l>To Tarquins euerlasting banishment. </l>
