          <salute>Gentlemen, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IT is now the second time of my appearing in Print in this nature, I should not have troubled you, but that I believe you will be as well pleased as my self; I am sure that when I applied my self to buying and reading of Books, I was very well satisfied when I could purchase a new Play. I have promised you three this Tearm, A Cure for a Cuckold was the first, this the second, and the third, viz. Gamer Gurtons Needle is ready for you. I have several others that I intend for you suddenly: I shall not (as some others of my profession have done) promise more then I will perform in a year or two, or it may be never; but I will assure you that I shall never leave printing, so long as you shall continue buying. I have several Manuscripts of this nature, written by worthy Authors, and I account it much pity they should now lye dormant, and buried in oblivion, since ingenuity is so likely to be encouraged, by reason of the happy Restauration of our Liberties. We have had the private Stage for some years clouded, and under a tyrannical command, though the publick Stage of England has produc'd many monstrous villains, some of which have deservedly made their exit. I believe future Ages will not credit the transactions of our late Times to be other than a Play, or a Romance: I am sure in most Romantick Plays there hath been more probability, then in our true (though sad) Stories. Gentlemen, I will not further trouble you at this time, onely I shall tell you, that if you please to repair to my Shop, I shall furnish you with all the Plays that were ever yet printed. I have 700, several Plays, and most of them several times over, and I intend to increase my Store as I sell; And I hope you will by your frequent buying, encourage </p>

            <p>You cannot be so shallow, as to think I took her with a lustful appetite? This honored Badge proclaims that lust is past. Our seizing her was motive to your good, if you conceive it. List, and Ile explain it: Within our Land our foes are resident, Scicilla's King, under whose Government these many years you have been Servitors. The reason this: When he did first invade, we found our self too weak to make resistance, and under show of satisfaction we did resign to him our Dignity, pretending search of Radagon his son; which he accepted, and did back return to Scicillia, leaving Deputy to Govern here. And though Pallatio bore the name of Rule, it was by his permission. Do but weigh the servile yoke of foreign Government, what danger may ensue, what priviledge you loose in Thrace, if we be dispossest, the time of Truce expired, and he's returned to take possession? For without his son, our Crown and Kingdom both are forfeited into his hands; which yet we may prevent, if you'l agree to joyn your Force with ours, and back expulse him. We'l not onely grant your Queen her liberty, but we'l enlarge your former Priviledge; give you choice of State, Honor, and Dignity, make you Lords and Knights, and in remembrance of the Shepherds Wars, adde a new Festival; which at your charge shall yearly be performed. Consider on't. </p>

A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length.
