Doe you cry sirrah? saies hee. Let mee see your heele; if it be not hurt, Ile make you cry for something. So he claps my head betweene his legges, and pulles off my shooe. I hauing shifted no sockes in a sea 'night, the Gentleman cryed foh; and said my feete were base and cowardly feete, they stuncke for feare. Then hee knock'd my shooe about my pate, and I cryed O, once more. In the meane time comes a shag. hair'd dogge by, and rubbes against his shinnes. The Gentleman tooke the dog in shagge-haire to be some Watch-man in a rugge gowne; and swore hee would hang mee vp at the next doore with my lanthorne in my hand, that passengers might see their way as they went without rubbing against Gentlemens shinnes. So, for want of a Cord. hee tooke his owne garters off; and as he was going to make a nooze, I watch'd my time and ranne away. And as I ranne (indeede) I bid him hang himselfe in his owne gatters. So hee in choler, pursued mee hither as you see. </p>

Charlemont lyes in prison for a thousand Crownes. And here I haue a thousand Crownes. Honestie tels mee t'were well done to release Charlemont. But discretion sayes I had much a doe to come by this; and when this shall be gone I know not where to singer any more: especially if I employ it to this vse, which is like to endanger mee into my Fathers perpetuall displeasure. And then I may goe hang my selfe, or be forc'd to doe that, will make another saue mee the labour. No matter. Charlemont! Thou gau'st mee my life and that's somewhat of a purer earth then gold as fine as it is. T'is no courtesie I doe thee but thankefulnesse. I owe thee it and Ile pay it. Hee sought brauely, but the Officers drag'd him villanously. Arrant knaues! for vsing him so discourteously; may the sins o'the poore people be so few, that you sha'not be able to spare so much out o'your gettings, as will pay for the hyre of a lame staru'd hackney to ride to an execution. But goe a foote to the gallowes, and be hang'd. May elder brothers turne good husbands, and younger brothers get good wiues; that there be no neede of debt-bookes, nor vse of Serieants. May there be all peace but i'the warre, and all charitie but i'the Diuell; so that prisons may be turn'd to Hospitals, though the Officers liue othe beneuolence.
