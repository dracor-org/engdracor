          <salute>My LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHen I had the Honour to present this COMEDY to your Lordships perusall I designed it as an acknowledgment, or rather as my first Fruits in the Dramatic way for the many Favours your Lordship had conferr'd upon me. But now it is forced to beg your Protection from the malice and severe usage it receiv'd from some of my Ill natured Freinds, who with a Justice peculiar to themselves, passed sentence upon it unseen or heard and at the representation made it their business to persecute it with a barbarous variety of Noise and Tumult, that many of the well meaning Spectatours (for I am sure it had very few Hearers) must conclude it a very Criminall performance. As I should never have been vaine enough to have valued my self upon the opinion of such weake Judges, so I am not much mortified at my falling under their Indignation. But tho' I can easily forgive such an ungenerous way of proceedure in relation to my self, who never expected to subsist by the Stage; Yet it is a precedent of dangerous consequence, and may happen to fall very severely upon those Gentlemen whose ill fortune or Genius shall lead them to attempt this sort of writing. An unrighteous Faction may be formed against the Jastest, and most regular Composition; and no man is safe if these Gentlemen (whom we must allow good Criticks in dressing) shall assume to vent their ill grounded Fury, and spet their venome upon every Authour that endeavours <pb xml:id="ep000582-004-a"/>to divert them. At the same time 'tis my comfort that better Plays have met with the like fate from unthinking imcompetent Judges: And without vanity several of a meaner Caracter have found a reception they never merited. </p>
        <p>'Tis this Reflexion has somewhat releiv'd me under the late miscarryage of my Play and is a sensible satisfaction to me that your Lordship (who is acknowledg'd by all Parties for the most correct and Judicious writer, the truest Judge, and the most disinterested Partron; to be the delight, the ornament, and support of our Age) has been pleased to peruse and approve it. Your single Suffrage weighs more with me, and the thinking part of mankind, then the repeated acclamations of a numerous assembly. </p>
        <p>My LORD, Should I vainly presume to discribe every inherent and particular Grace, that shines in the constellation of your Lordships Virtue: or enumerate those rare qualifications that have rendred your Lordship so universally Esteemed, belov'd and admir'd, both at home and abroad; I should loose my self in the Rapture and Contemplation. But your Lordship has already receiv'd incense from happyer hands but from none that has a profounder honour for your Lordship, then </p>

        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THis Play had the misfortune to come very unluckily on the Stage, where it found very few Freinds: Their prejudice had decree'd it should suffer under their Indignation, and before it was off the Stocks, had predestin'd it to Damnation. Their kindness being greater for the preceding Play, resolved they would see no sin in their Favourite Jacob, but expose their unfortunate Esau to Reprobation, without the least hopes of a Blessing. The Theatre was by Faction transformed into a Bear-Garden, hissing, mimicking, ridiculing, and Cat-calling; the Actours could not support themselves against so strong a Currant. And if any came with a designe to be diverted, they were distracted with the variety of Noyses, and continual uproars; they could neither hear, nor Judge of the matter: Had any of the Ancient Romans reviv'd to have been witness to this Interlude, this medly <hi>of Noises</hi>; they would certainly conclude the Moon was labouring under some dismal Eclypse, and the Pagans of the Pit were endeavouring to recover her out of her Trance with this horrid din. The distracted Players were stunn'd with their clamours, and though they had often stood the shock of Thunder and Lightning on the Stage, yet now they found themselves confounded in this real Tempest: They fancyed the Scene had been Translated into Sicily and the Earth had gaped to swallow these Grumbletonians, like the murmuring Israelites of old. Some dark Sons of uncertain Fathers, infinitely diverted themselves with their melodious Cat-calls, these Sons of Zerviah vanquished the Stage, back'd with the untuneable brayings of Balaams Asse that joyned in this dismal consort: In this distraction we may safely conclude the Audience were wholly strangers to the Plot and conduct of the Play. And therefore it will be reasonable they should now read for their money what in the Action they could neither Hear nor Understand. </p>
        <p>I am not Ignorant a just Cause may suffer under the prejudice of an <hi>Ignoramus Jury</hi>, or an unjust Judge may stop his Ears against the voice of the Charmer, and harden his heart to the severest Judgment; or that an incensed Mob may be wrought up to break thro' all Laws, and commit the highest outrages, and Barbarities. But after the fury of their military Execution is over they may relent of their rigour, and have some reserve of compassion for the unfortunate Martyr, that suffered their indignities with all constancy and Patience. Had our unlucky Authour been worthy to have known they were absolutly bent to damn his Play, unsight unseen, his caution would have withdrawn him from the Thunder of their displeasure. But now we are convinc'd by the surprising success of the Baudy Batchelour, that the nicest Ladies <pb xml:id="ep000582-005-a"/>may be brought (by good mannagment) to stand the fire of a smutty Jest, and never flintch for the matter. They are the sensible Judges that family duties can not proceed without the creature comfort: Nor Nature be well instructed without the help of a feskue. These Camelion Ladies cannot like the Spanish Jennets conceive by the ayr, or grow big with such a Timpany. </p>
        <q>
          <l>Tanquam conjugibus suis Mariti, </l>
          <l>Non possunt sine Mentula placere. </l>
          <l>What Sot can thinke to please a Beauty, </l>
          <l>That wants wherewith to do his duty. </l>
        </q>
        <p>But I must beg the Ladies pardon that I introduce a Forreign Tongue, that can make use of their Mothers to a better advantage, but in a Preface it is necessary to sprinkle a little Latin, to shew our Breeding. The Authours are now convinc'd the Batchelour has touch'd upon the true string, to please and tickle: They are now grown more generous then to deny their sentiments and Inclinations, and scorn any such bashfull pretence, but openly avow and countenance that Poet, that seasons his Scenes with salt and good humour, to please the hant-gousts of their fancies: and make their Eares glow with licentious Farce, which they are resolv'd to stand by and justify: What though the Plots are old, and stale, they are so prettily jumbled and blended together they can never fail of being well receiv'd. Tho some nicer Ladies are of an opinion, that an impure Idea, that is obscene in the first conception (though never so cleanly wrapt up) can no way be made passable: But these are squeamish pallats that strain at a gnat in publick, and after make no bones of a Camel on occasion. What does it import if <hi>Parson Spintext </hi>have a wicked design on the Alderman's wife? What harm was it if his agreable Impudence revenged the City cheats upon the Aldermans head, and exalted his horns above the rest of his Brethren? There cannot be a taking Play without some Limberham or fumbling Alderman, or keeper to expose▪ let the fair Gilt ingage her Gallant like a Spider in her own cobweb, before her poor Nickapoops face, unbar the sluces, that her kindness may run down in a mighty stream; let the lightning of Courtship melt his Daughters maidenhead in the scaboard, or chopping of that Hidra's Head of barren Virginity, let twins sprout up in their stead and let the Family of love be propigated quite through the City. </p>
        <p>But hold, it is not reasonable for me to ramble into these pleasant forbiden paths, but say something besuteing this poor Brat I must now turn a drift into the World in melancholly weeds. </p>
        <q>
          <l>Vade sed incultus qualem decet exulis esse, </l>
          <l>Infelix habitum temporis hujus habe. </l>
          <l>Go on adorn'd thou curst abandon'd Play, </l>
          <l>Let luckier Authours, court a happyer day. </l>
        </q>
        <pb xml:id="ep000582-005-b"/>
        <p>I may well say Vnadorn'd, for there was nothing done for the advantage or decoration of this Play: not a farthing expended. When I had given them leave to Act it, I was told it was theirs, and they would Cooke it according to their own humour. Some of the <hi>Politick would be </hi>of the Coffee-house had given it an ill Name and Caracter and were glad to see it succeed accordingly. The Songs designed were never set by omission or combination: The Master of the Revells had expunged what he pleas'd, least forsooth it should prove Bawdy or give offence, thereby making the sense imperfect, which the Actours would not let me mend or supply; though now I submit it, to your Judgment as I first design'd it. The Actours cut out what they pleased to shorten their parts according to their own humours, and I must stand by and see it mutilated and dismembred before my Face: When it appear'd on the Stage, it was but an imperfect Rehearsall, for some could never repeat their parts, and therefore impossible they could Act them: Some were perfect and could have done it right, if others had been able to have play'd their parts up to them. I shall conclude with the words of Martiall. </p>

        <l>Peace you grave Sot: elsewhere your Cant bestow, </l>

        <l>BY sensless, Faction, and a noisy Pit, </l>

        <l>Not in himself he has enough I swear </l>
        <l>But suffers for it in his Auditor. </l>
        <l>Else why should he, were that defect his Crime, </l>

        <l>From Spawn of Wills those wits of future Tense, </l>
        <l>He now appeals to men of riper sense: </l>
        <l>And hopes to find some shelter from the wrath </l>
        <l>Of furious Criticks of implicit Faith. </l>
        <l>Whose judgements always ebh, but zeal flows high, </l>
        <l>Who for there truth upon the Church rely. </l>
        <l>Wills is the Mother Church. From thence their Creed </l>
        <l>And as that censures, Poets must Succeed, </l>
        <l>Here the great Patriarch of Parnassus sits, </l>
        <l>And grants his Bulls to the Subordinate Wits. </l>

        <l>That crowd the Boxes and the Pit infest. </l>
        <l>Who their great Masters falling spitle they lick, </l>
        <l>And at the neighb'ring Playhouse judge on tick, </l>
        <l>Thus have I seen from some decaying Oak, </l>
        <l>A numerous Toad-stool brood, his moisture suck </l>
        <l>And as the Reverend Log his verdure sheds, </l>
        <l>The fungous off-spring flourishes and spreads. </l>
        <l>'Tis true a Legion of young Criticks may, </l>
        <l>If so resolv'd, with Cat-calls damn a play: </l>
        <l>Who doubts their power? tho' had he us'd his throat </l>
        <l>Each Ass among them own'd a lowder note. </l>
        <l>Well! let these sucking wits their whistles have, </l>
        <l>Set off with Silver Bells, and Coral brave. </l>
        <l>Let carefull Mother rub each tender gumm, </l>
        <l>And make way for Satiric teeth to come. </l>

        <byline>Written by Sir <hi>Charles Sydley</hi>. </byline>
        <l>ENvy and Faction rule this grumbling Age, </l>
        <l>The State they cannot, but they shake the Stage, </l>
        <l>This barren trade some woud engross, still hopeing </l>
        <l>From our poor Port, to banish Interloping: </l>
        <l>And like the plodding Lawyers, take great care </l>
        <l>To elbow blooming merit, from the Bar: </l>
        <l>In every Age there were a sort of Men </l>
        <l>As you do now, damn'd all was written then. </l>
        <l>Thousands before 'em less provok'd their Pride </l>
        <l>Then one poor rivall straining by their side, </l>
        <l>Such vermin Critticks we expect to find, </l>
        <l>For Nature knows not how to loose a kind </l>
        <l>The stinking Poll Cat, nor the Mole that's Blind. </l>
        <l>But against old as well as new to rage, </l>
        <l>Is the peculiar Phrensy of this Age. </l>
        <l>Shackspear must down, and you must praise no more </l>
        <l>Soft Desdemona, nor the Jealous Moor: </l>
        <l>Shackspear whose fruitfull Genius, happy Wit </l>
        <l>Was fram'd and finisht at a lucky hit </l>
        <l>The Pride of Nature, and the shame of Schools, </l>
        <l>Born to Create, and not to Learn from Rules; </l>
        <l>Must please no more, his Bastards now deride </l>
        <l>Their Fathers Nakedness they ought to hide, </l>
        <l>But when on Spurs their Pegasus they force, </l>
        <l>Their Jaded Muse is distanc'd in the Course: </l>
        <l>All that is now has been before tis true, </l>
        <l>But yet the Art, the Fashion may be new: </l>
        <l>Tho' old Materials the large pallace raise, </l>
        <l>The skillfull Architect deserves his praise. </l>
        <l>If nothing please, you are not nice, but sick, </l>
        <l>'Tis want of stomack, ever to dislike. </l>
        <l>On our past Poets, petty Juries sit, </l>
        <l>The Living sink beneath your present spite, </l>
        <l>As if this were the doomsday of all wit. </l>
        <l>But Beaus and Ladies for your selves be wise </l>
        <l>You'l break our Lottery if none draw a Prize </l>
        <l>For this one night, do as kind Lovers use </l>
        <l>Tye up strict Judgement and let fancy loose. </l>

            <p>HOW empty this Town is grown, since this unlucky War.

            <p>This fellow has a subtle Brain, and a Genius sit for Business: he had his first seasoning, under a petty-fogging Solliciter. And there grew well acquainted with the Nicking part of Business, but straining a Knavish point too high, was forc'd to fly beyond Sea for the safety of his Ears: till the persecution was past, and there accomplish'd himself in all Forreign as well as Domestick Politicks: At his return Fortune threw him on my Father's Service, where by his Dexterity of management, He has wound himself into his affairs, and is become Prime Minister in the Conduct of his most important matters. I have by degrees drawn him over, and fixt him of my party, and by that means am Master of all my Fathers Secrets, which come within the Sphere of his knowledge. And knowing only Interest could secure him, I have promis'd him Mountains, when Fate calls the old man aside, and in the mean time drew him in to be bound for my Debts, which will oblige him to any hazardous undertaking, will work him out of his ingagements, I must make use of him to advance an other hundred pound. Credit is like a Pump grows dry for want of working, one hat full of water puts it in Tune, then you may serve your self and friend, and fill your Cisterns against a further occasion. </p>

Hint it to him, since your Father will have it so, you are very indifferent in the point of Marriage: will comply with his fancy, but choose with your own: That you look on Marriage as a humane Politick Invention, a sort of a Smith-field-Bargain where inclinations are bought and Sold: or swopt away for present Interest. Carry it on with Gayety and Gallantry of Humour: Talk much of Plays, Musick, Meetings, Balls the Mall, and freedom of Conversation: And I'le secure you he shall be the first shall recant, and pay a round forfeiture to be well off the Bargain. If he declines his Courtship your Father will have no reason to Complain, for though Men are never so deprav'd and Debauch'd in their own Principles, they wish their Wives should be Examples the other way. </p>

We continued in this happy Circumstance, for some time: When a cross accident blasted all my hopes and has made an Eternal Seperation: But I am still ready to Sacrifice my life for her Interest and Service: But must for ever abandon her love: I can charge no fault on her or my self; but the odd Capriciousness of my Fate distracts me: And this Madam, is the sole Intrigue and Correspondence I have entertain'd or ingag'd in for some time. </p>

            <p>I Am well pleas'd with your contrivance to free your self from that Impudent pretender Sir <hi>Noisy Parrat</hi>, who having got your Fathers Approbation thought to invade and carry you by right of Conquest. Parents should strive to win our minds, by fair, and gentle Methods: and not force their Childrens Inclinations like ridged Tyrants. </p>

            <p>That I will, and ingage if ever he be so audacious to return, we will drive him out of the Feild. But my Friend, it will be reasonable since I so freely ingage in your Quarrell, you should be my confident and assist me. I have already had two interveiws with your Brother Fox in mask unknown, and by Chance: entertain'd him with all Raillery and freedom. The same day he din'd with my Brother and me, I chang'd the Copy of my countenance and receiv'd him with all gravety, he not guessing I was the Jolly Lady in the Mask: He told me at my next meeting in the Mask, my face had strangely shaken his Constancy, and prest me to discover mine by way of Antidote: But I insisted I expected a firmer proof of his Constancy and obedience, ere I oblig'd him so far: and if he slighted my Conversation he was at liberty to pursue his Conquest upon my Country Rivall: He submitted and vow'd fidelity, and I receiv'd him into Favour: If I find him a man of strict honour and Justice, It will sooner take with me then the sparkling fancys of an airy Wit. And if he has ingag'd his Inclinations to the Lady in the Mask when he discovers me to be the same, it will prove a double Conquest: I will not doubt you can be unfaithfull to me for the sake of a Brother when one of the same Relation has already vow'd himself your Servant. And if I had discover'd any unworthy Quality in him I would acquaint you with it, to avoid his pretensions. </p>

Fortune chains us Women like Prentices, to the will and humour of our Husbands, who must rise or fall by their care and Management; while the distracting cares of Families and Children devides our hearts, and spirits us away into remote and distant Countrys and <pb n="44" xml:id="ep000582-030-a"/>by degrees Supplant that kindness which at present governs our hearts. </p>

            <p>Madam you say right, for though love makes a Bon-fire to wellcome you home, it will hardly keep the Embers alive to warm us when you go to Bed. The joys and transports of love like Lightning dazells us, and then follows the thundring Noise of Pekes, Jelousies, Hopes, Fears, turmoiles, vexations, troubles and disappointments like the successive hot and cold Fit, of a Feavour and Ague, of which women made of a refin'd mold and of a more noble Original and Extraction, are more sensible of the jarring discords. But how to preserve so great a happyness will lye under the direction of a deeper Philosopher then I can pretend to be. Yet I must comply with your Ladyships desires and venture on some chance directions a Sketch of a fancy— Let Beauty, Fortune, a good Wit and disposition concurr in your Choice, which Blessings singly are but melancholly Company when you are joyn'd for your Lives: Let him be a man of Virtue and Honour of a Steady humour and disposition, not given to be peevish or froward, or unreasonable opinionated hugging himself in the chaire of the Scorner. If little quarrells do arise give way to each other, and never prosecute them with eagernes and contention, but let the next glass of Wine, like a Cup of Lethe drown the remembrance. So may your young Love like new Wine not glut and cloy with the sweetness of the first Injoyment, but drink the more refin'd pure and sprightly dureing your Lives, being a continuall Feast and Sauce for every days Injoyment. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE, </head>
        <byline>Spoken by Mrs. Lassells. </byline>
        <l>WHat diffring designes we Women lay </l>
        <l>She to avoid, and I to snap the Prey: </l>
        <l>Virtue, and Fortune, makes her Luster great: </l>
        <l>Raising that Value, I but counterfeit: </l>
        <l>We hold our Sexes Charter by deceipt, </l>
        <l>The Pious seeming Saint proves oft a Cheat: </l>
        <l>Why should you grutch, if an old battred Lover </l>
        <l>Pass for a Maid, in a fresh guilded cover? </l>
        <l>For what e're trips she makes, she ne're miscarrys, </l>
        <l>But proves a perfect Virgin when she marrys, </l>
        <l>Our Fop by seeming Innocence is caught, </l>
        <l>Few Eagle eyes, discern so nice a fault, </l>
        <l>And while his roughness Ravishes a kiss, </l>
        <l>We seem transported at the unknown Bliss. </l>
        <l>Methinks I hear Pride and ill nature Cry </l>
        <l>Why is sin blest, and scandall rais'd so high </l>
        <l>Out brass'ning Beauty Birth and Quality: </l>
        <l>How many wandring Rovers, chance does fix, </l>
        <l>From humble Pattens rais'd to Coach and Six. </l>
        <l>Faith 'tis not worth your thoughts, for as some say </l>
        <l>The world is but a Stage, our life a Play: </l>
        <l>Why should We be astonisht at the matter </l>
        <l>If Strowling Miss mounts on our Proud Theatre. </l>
        <l>Now we should Court your favour to our Play, </l>
        <l>And Pardon for our Authours first Essay, </l>
        <l>Hopeing this Rugged Bench wont prove severe </l>
        <l>To his first fault, let him for once go Cleer: </l>
        <l>In doubtfull durance Pensive he remains, </l>
        <l>Till your good pleasure shall strike of his Chains: </l>
        <l>And Sir's if this a maiden session proves, </l>
        <l>Let us alone to fit you all with Gloves. </l>
