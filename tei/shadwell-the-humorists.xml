        <head>To the most Illustrious Princess MARGARET DUTCHESS OF NEWCASTLE. </head>
        <p>May it please your Grace, </p>
        <p>THe favourable Reception my Impertinents found from your Excellent Lord, and my Noble Patron, and the great mercy your Grace has for all offenders of this kind, have made me presume humbly to lay this Comedy at your feet: for none can better than your Grace, protect this mangled, persecuted Play from the fury of its Enemies and Detractors, who by your admirable Endowments of Nature and Art, have made all Mankind your Friends and Admirers. You have not been content onely to surmount all your own Sex in the excellent Qualities of a Lady and a Wife, but you must overcome all ours in wit and understanding. All our Sex have reason to envy you, and your own to be proud of you, which by you have obtained an absolute Victory over us. It were a vain thing in me to endeavour to commend those excellent Pieces that have fallen from your Graces Pen, since all the World does. <pb xml:id="ep000729-003-a"/>And this is not intended for a Panegyrick, but a Dedication, which I humbly desire your Grace to pardon. </p>
        <p>The Play was intended a Satyr against Vice and Folly, and to whom is it more properly to be presented than to your Grace? who are, above all your Sex, so eminent in Wit and Vertue. I have been more obliged by my Lord Duke than by any man, and to whom can I shew my gratitude better than to your Grace, that are so excellent a part of him? But Madam, this 〈◊〉 of mine is a very unsuitable return to be made for his favours and the Noble Present of all your excellent Books. But I hope your Grace will forgive me, when you consider, that the Interest of all Poets is to fly for protection to Welbecke; which will never fail to be their Sanctuary, so long as there you are pleased so nobly to patronize Poesie, and so happily practise it. That will still be the onely place where they will find encouragement that do well, and pardon that do ill; and of the latter of these no man has more need than </p>
        <p>Madam, Your Graces Most humble and obedient Servant </p>
        <p>THO. SHADWELL. </p>

        <head>Preface. </head>
        <p>THis Play (besides the Errors in the writing of it) came upon the Stage with all the disadvantages imaginable: First, I was forced, after I had finish'd it, to blot out the main design of it; finding, that, contrary to my intention, it had given offence. The second disadvantage was, that notwithstanding I had (to the great prejudice of the Play) given satisfaction to all the exceptions made against it, it met with the clamorous opposition of a numerous party, bandied against it, and resolved, as much as they could to damn it right or wrong, before they had heard or seen a word on't. The last, and not the least, was, that the Actors (though since they have done me some right) at first were extreamly imperfect in the Action of it. The least of these had been enough to have spoil'd a very good Comedy, much more such a one as mine. The last <hi>(viz.</hi>) imperfect Action, had like to have destroy d <hi>She would if she could</hi>, which I think (and I have the Authority of some of the best Judges in England for't) is the best Comedy that has been written since the Restauration of the Stage: And even that, for the imperfect representation of it at first, received such prejudice, that, had it not been for the favour of the Court, in all probability it had never got up again; and it suffers for it, in a great measure, to this very day. This of mine, after all these blows, had fallen beyond redemption, had it not been revived, after the second day, by her kindness (which I can never enough acknowledge) who, for four days together, beautified it with the most excellent Dancings that ever has been seen upon the Stage. This drew my enemies, as well as friends, till it was something better acted, understood, and liked, than at first: By this means the poor Play's life was prolonged, and, I hope, will live in spight of Malice; if not upon the Stage, at least in Print. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000729-004-a"/>
        <p>Yet do not think I will defend all the faults of it: Before it was alter'd, I could better have answer'd for it: yet, as it is, I hope it will not wholly displease you in the reading. I should not say so much for it, if I did not find so much undeserved malice against it. </p>
        <p>My design was in it, to reprehend some of the Vices and Follies of the Age, which I take to be the most proper, and most useful way of writing Comedy. If I do not perform this well enough, let not my endeavors be blam'd. </p>
        <p>Here I must take leave to dissent from those, who seem to insinuate that the ultimate end of a Poet is to delight, without correction or instruction: Methinks a Poet should never acknowledge this, for it makes him of as little use to Mankind as a Fidler, or Dancing Master, who delights the fancy onely, without improving the Judgement. </p>
        <p>Horace, the best Judge of Poetry, found other business sor a Poet </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Pectus praeceptis format amicis; </l>
          <l>Asperitatis &amp; Invidiae, corrector, &amp; Irae, </l>
          <l>Recte facta refert, orientia tempora notis </l>
          <l>Instruit Exemplis: </l>
        </lg>
        <p>I Confess a Poet ought to do all that he can, decently to please, that so he may instruct. To adorn his Images of Vertue so delightfully to affect people with a secret veneration of it in others, and an emulation to practice it in themselves: And to render their Figures of Vice and Folly so ugly and detestable, to make people hate and despise them, not onely in others, but (if it be possible) in their dear selves. And in this latter I think Comedy more useful than Tragedy; because the Vices and Follies in Courts (as they are too tender to be touch'd) so they concern but a few; whereas the Cheats, Villanies, and troublesome Follies, in the common conversation of the World, are of concernment to all the Body of Mankind. </p>
        <p>And a Poet can no more justly be censured for ill nature, in detesting such Knaveries, and troublesome impertinencies, as are an imposition on all good men, and a disturbance of Societies in general, <pb xml:id="ep000729-004-b"/>than the most vigilant of our Judges can be thought so, for detesting Robbers and High-way-men; who are hanged, not for the sake of the money they take (for of what value can that be to the life of a man) but for interrupting common communication, and disturbing Society in general. For the sake of good men ill should be punished; and 'tis ill nature to the first, not to punish the last. A man cannot truly love a good man, that does not hate a bad one; nor a Wiseman, that does not hate a Fool; this love and hatred are correlatives, and the one necessarily implies the other. I must confess it were ill nature, and below a man, to fall upon the natural imperfections of men, as of Lunaticks, Ideots, or men born monstrous. But these can never be made the proper subject of a Satyr, but the affected vanities, and artificial fopperies of men, which (sometimes even contrary to their natures) they take pains to acquire, are the proper subject of a Satyr. </p>
        <p>And for the reformation of Fopps and Knaves, I think Comedy most useful, because to render Vices and Fopperies very ridiculous, is much a greater punishment than Tragedy can inflict upon 'em. There we do but subject 'em to hatred, or at worst to death; here we make them live to be despised and laugh'd at, which certainly makes more impression upon men, than even death can do. </p>
        <p>Again, I confess a Poet ought to endeavour to please, and by this way of writing may please, as well as by any way whatsoever, (if he writes it well) when he does <q>Simul &amp; Iucunda &amp; idonea dicere vitae. </q>
        </p>
        <p>Men of Wit and Honour, and the best Judges (and such as cannot be touch'd by Satyr) are extreamly delighted with it; and for the rest <q>Odi profanum vulgus &amp; Arceo. </q>
        </p>
        <p>The rabble of little people, are more pleas'd with <hi>Jack Puddings </hi>being soundly kick'd, or having a Custard handsomely thrown in his face, than with all the wit in Plays: and the higher <pb xml:id="ep000729-005-a"/>sort of Rabble (as there may be a rabble of very fine people in this illiterate age) are more pleased with the extravagant and unnatural actions, the trifles, and fripperies of a Play, or the trappings and ornaments of Nonsense, than with all the wit in the world. </p>
        <p>This is one reason why we put our Fopps into extravagant, and unnatural habits; it being a cheap way of conforming to the understanding of those brisk, gay Sparks, that judge of Wit or Folly by the Habit; that being indeed the onely measure they can take in judging of Mankind, who are Criticks in nothing but a Dress. </p>
        <p>Extraordinary pleasure was taken of old, in the Habits of the Actors, without reference to sense, which Horace observes, and reprehends in his Epistle to Augustus </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Garganum mugire putes nemus, aut Mare Tuscum, </l>
          <l>Tanto cum strepitu ludi spectantur, &amp; Artes, </l>
          <l>Divitiaeque peregrinae, quibus oblitus actor, </l>
          <l>Cum stetit in scena, concurrit dextera Laevae, </l>
          <l>Dixit adhuc aliquid! nil sane, quid placet ergo? </l>
        </lg>
        <p>But for a Poet to think (without wit or good humor, under such a Habit) to please men of sense, is a presumption inexcusable. If I be guilty of this, it is an error of my understanding, not of my will. But I challenge the most clamorous and violent of my Enemies (who would have the Town believe that every thing I write, is too nearly reflecting upon persons) to accuse me, with truth, of representing the real actions, or using the peculiar, affected phrases, or manner of speech of any one particular Man, or Woman living. </p>
        <p>I cannot indeed create a new Lauguage, but the Phantastick Phrases, used in any Play of mine, are not appropriate to any one Fop, but applicable to many. </p>
        <p>Good men, and men of sence, can never be represented but to their advantage, nor can the Characters of Fools Knaves, Whores, or Cowards (who are the people I deal most with in Comedies) concern any that are not eminently so: Nor will any apply to themselves what I write in this kind, that have but the wit, or honesty, to think tolerably well of themselves. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000729-005-b"/>
        <p>But it has been objected, that good men, and men of sence enough, may have blind-sides, that are liable to reprehension, and that such men should be represented upon a Stage, is intollerable. </p>
        <p>'Tis true, excellent men may have errors, but they are not known by them, but by their excellencies: their prudence overcomes all gross follies, or conceals the less vanities, that are unavoidable Concomitants of humane nature; or if some little errors do escape 'em. and are known, they are the least part of those men, and they are not distinguished in the world by them, but by their perfections; so that (if such blind-sides, or errors be reresented) they do not reflect upon them, but upon such on whom these are predominant; and that receive such a Biass from 'em, that it turns 'em wholly from the wayes of Wisdom or Morality. </p>
        <p>And, even this representation, does not reflect upon any particular man, but upon very many of the same kind: For if a man should bring such a humor upon the Stage (if there be such a humor in the world) as onely belongs to one, or two persons, it would not be understood by the Audience, but would be thought (for the singularity of it) wholly unnatural, and would be no jest to them neither. </p>
        <p>But I have had the fortune to have had a general humor (in a Play of mine) applied to three, or four men (whose persons I never saw, or humors ever heard of) till the Play was acted. </p>
        <p>As long as men wrest the Writings of Poets to their own corrupted sense, and with their Clamors prevail too, you must never look for a good Comedy of Humor, for a humor (being the representation of some extravagance of Mankind) cannot but in some thing resemble some man, or other, or it is monstrous, and unnatural. </p>
        <p>After this restraint upon Poets, there is little scope left, unless we retrieve the exploded Barbarismes of Fool, Devil, Giant, or Monster, or translate French Farces, which, with all the wit of the English, added to them, can scarce be made tollerable. </p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, I believe, was very unjustly taxed for personating particular men, but it will ever be the fate of them, that write <pb xml:id="ep000729-006-a"/>the humors of the Town, especially in a foolish, and vicious Age. Pardon me (Reader) that I name him in the same page with my self; who pretend to nothing more, than to joyn with all men of sense and learning in admiration of him; which, I think, I do not out of a true understanding of him; and for this I cannot but value my self. Yet, by extolling his way of writing, I would not insinuate to you that I can practise it; though I would if I could, a thousand times sooner than any mans. </p>
        <p>And here I must make a little digression, and take liberty to dissent from my particular friend, for whom I have a very great respect, and whose Writings I extreamly admire; and though I will not say his is the best way of writing, yet, I am sure, his manner of writing it is much the best that ever was. And I may say of him, as was said of a Celebrated Poet, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cui unquam Poetarum magis proprium fuit dubito aestro incalescere? Quis, ubi incaluit, fortius, &amp; falicius debacchatur. </foreign>His Verse is smoother and deeper, his thoughts more quick and surprising, his raptures more mettled and higher; and he has more of that in his writing, which Plato calls <seg xml:lang="unk">〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉</seg>, than any other Heroick Poet. And those who shall go about to imitate him, will be found to flutter, and make a noise, but never rise. Yet (after all this) I cannot think it impudence in him, or any man to endeavour to imitate Mr. Johnson, whom he confesses to have fewer failings than all the English Poets, which implies he was the most perfect, and best Poet; and why should not we endeavour to imitate him? because we cannot arrive to his excellence? 'Tis true we cannot, but this is no more an argument, than for a Soldier (who considers with himself he cannot be so great a one as <hi>Julius Caesar</hi>) to run from his Colours, and be none; or to speak of a less thing, why should any man study Mathematicks after <hi>Archimedes, &amp;c.</hi> This Principle would be an obstruction to the progress of all learning and knowledge in the world. Men of all Professions ought certainly to follow the best in theirs, and let not their endeavours be blamed, if they go as far as they can in the right way, though they be unsuccessful, and attain not their ends. If Mr. Johnson be the most raultless Poet, I am so far from thinking it impudence to endeavour to imitate him, that it <pb xml:id="ep000729-006-b"/>would rather (in my opinion) seem impudence in me not to do it. </p>
        <p>I cannot be of their opinion who think he wanted wit, I am sure, if he did, he was so far from being the most faultless, that he was the most faulty Poet of his time, but, it may be answered, that his Writings were correct, though he wanted fire; but I think flat and dull things are as incorrect, and shew as little Judgment in the Author, nay less than sprightly and mettled Nonsense does. But I think he had more true wit than any of his Contemporaries; that other men had sometimes things that seemed more fiery than his, was because they were placed with so many sordid and mean things about them, that they made a greater show. </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Inter quae varbum 〈◊〉, si forté, decorum, </l>
          <l>Si versus paulo concinnor, unus, &amp; alter, </l>
          <l>Injuste totum ducit, venditque Poema. </l>
        </lg>
        <p>Nor can I think, to the writing of his humors (which were not onely the follies, but vices and subtleties of men) that wit was not required, but judgment; where, by the way, they speak as if judgment were a less thing than wit. But certainly it was meant otherwise by nature, who subjected wit to the government of judgment, which is the noblest faculty of the mind. Fancy rough-draws, but judgement smooths and finishes; nay judgment does in deed comprehend wit, for no man can have that who has not wit. In fancy mad men equal, if not excel all others, and one may as well say that one of those mad men is as good a man as a temperate wiseman, as that one of the very fancyful Plays (admired most by Women) can be so good a Play as one of Johnson's correct, and well-govern'd Comedies. </p>
        <p>The reason given by some, why Johnson needed not wit in writing humor, is, because humor is the effect of observation, and observation the effect of judgment; but observation is as much necessary in all other Plays, as in Comedies of humor: For first, even in the highest Tragedies, where the Scene lies in Courts, the Poet must have observed the Customs of Courts, and the <pb xml:id="ep000729-007-a"/>manner of conversing there, or he will commit many indecencies, and make his Persons too rough and ill-bred for a Court. </p>
        <p>Besides Characters in Plays being representations of the Vertues or Vices, Passions or Affections of Mankind, since there are no more new Vertues, or Vices; Passions, or Affections, the Idea's of these can no other way be received into the imagination of a Poet, but either from the Conversation or Writings of Men. After a Poet has formed a Character, (as fuppose of an Ambitious Man) his design is certainly to write it naturally, and he has no other rule to guid him in this, but to compare him with other men of that kind, that either he has heard of, or conversed with in the world, or read of in Books (and even this reading of Books is conversing with men) nay more, (besides judging of his Character) the Poet can fancy nothing of it, but what must spring from the Observation he has made of Men, or Books. </p>
        <p>If this argument (that the enemies of humor use) be meant in this sense, that a Poet, in the writing of a Fools Character, needs but have a man sit to him, and have his words and actions taken; in this case there is no need of wit. But 'tis most certain, that if we should do so, no one fool (though the best about the Town) could appear pleasantly upon the Stage, he would be there too dull a Fool, and must be helped out with a great deal of wit in the Author. I scruple not to call it so, first, because 't is not your down-right Fool that is a fit Character for a Play, but like Sir <hi>John Dawe </hi>and Sir <hi>Amorous la Foole</hi>, your witty, brisk, aiery Fopps, that are Entreprennants. Besides, wit in the Writer, (I think, without any Authority for it) may be said to be the invention of remote and pleasant thoughts of what kind soever; and there is as much occasion for such imaginations in the writing of a Curious Coxcomb's part, as in writing the greatest Hero's; and that which may be folly in the Speaker, may be so remote and pleasant, to require a great deal of wit in the Writer. The most Excellent Johnson put wit into the mouths of the meanest of his people, and which, is infinitely difficult, made it proper for 'em. <pb xml:id="ep000729-007-b"/>And I once heard a Person, of the greatest Wit and Judgement of the Age, say, that <hi>Bartholomew Fair </hi>(which consists most of low persons) is one of the Wittiest Plays in the World. If there be no wit required in the rendering Folly ridiculous, or Vice odious, we must accuse Juvenal the best Satyrist, and wittiest Man of all the Latine Writers, for want of it. </p>
        <p>I should not say so much of Mr. Johnson (whose Merit sufficiently justifies him to all Men of Sense) but that I think my self a little obliged to vindicate the Opinion I publickly declared, in my Epilogue to this Play; which I did upon mature consideration, and with a full satisfaction in my Judgement, and not out of a bare affected vanity of being thought his Admirer. </p>
        <p>I have onely one word more, to trouble you with, concerning this Trifle of my own, which is, that, as it is at present, it is wholly my own, without borrowing a tittle from any man; which I confess is too bold an attempt for so young a Writer; for (let it seem what it will) a Comedy of humor (that is not borrowed) is the hardest thing to write well; and a way of writing, of which a man can never be certain. </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Creditur, ex medio quia res accessit, habere </l>
          <l>Sudoris minimum, sed habet comoedia tanto </l>
          <l>Plus oneris, quanto veniae minus. </l>
        </lg>
        <p>That which (besides judging truly of Mankind) makes Comedy more difficult, is that the faults are naked and bare to most people, but the wit of it understood, or valued, but by few. Wonder not then if a man of ten times my parts, miscarries in the Attempt. </p>
        <p>I shall say no more of this of mine, but that the Humors are new (how well chosen I leave to you to judge) and all the words and actions of the Persons in the Play, are alwayes sutable to the Characters I have given of them; and, in all the Play, I have <pb xml:id="ep000729-008-a"/>gone according to that definition of humor, which I have given you in my Epilogue, in these words: </p>
        <lg>
          <l>A Humor is the Biasse of the Mind, </l>
          <l>By which, with violence, 'tis one way inclin'd. </l>
          <l>It makes our actions lean on one side still, </l>
          <l>And, in all Changes, that way bends the Will. </l>
        </lg>

          <l>First we declare against the wary Wit, </l>
          <l>Who having had the luck of one good hit </l>
          <l>Dares not appear again before the Pit. </l>
          <l>Some have done well; yet to remove all doubt, </l>

          <l>As our Gay empty Sparks at each new Fashion: </l>
          <l>Perpetually they fumble for the Bayes, </l>
          <l>With Poems, Songs, Lampoons, and long dull Playes. </l>
          <l>A man would wonder what the Devil they meant, </l>
          <l>(Like ill-nos'd Currs that onely foil the scent) </l>
          <l>To mangle Plots, and they'l as boldly do't; </l>
          <l>As our Sir Martin undertakes the Lute. </l>
          <l>Now for the Women— </l>

          <l>These Rampants have a hungry Worm indeed. </l>

          <l>Our craving Damosels, rather than stand out, </l>
          <l>With any raw-bone Coxcombs run about; </l>
          <l>Making no difference of Size or Age, </l>
          <l>From the Grim Hector to the beardless Page. </l>
          <l>Learn little ones, for shame learn to be wise, </l>
          <l>And not so very rank, nor yet so nice. </l>
          <l>Who buryes all his Wealth, and never lends, </l>
          <l>Is more a Wretch than he that wildly spends. </l>
          <l>And she who is so coy to fancy no man, </l>
          <l>Is yet a viler thing than she that's common. </l>
          <l>If you will own your selves concern'd you may, </l>

          <l>THe Mighty Prince of Poets, learned BEN, </l>
          <l>Who alone div'd into the Minds of Men: </l>
          <l>Saw all their wandrings, all their follies knew, </l>
          <l>And all their vain fantastick passions drew. </l>
          <l>In Images so lively and so true; </l>
          <l>That there each Humorist himself might view. </l>
          <l>Yet onely lash'd the Errors of the Times, </l>
          <l>And ne'r expos'd the Persons, but the Crimes: </l>
          <l>And never car'd for private frowns, when he </l>
          <l>Did but chastise publick iniquitie. </l>
          <l>He fear'd no Pimp, no Pick-pocket, or Drab; </l>
          <l>He fear'd no Bravo, nor no Ruffian's Stab. </l>
          <l>'Twas he alone true Humors understood, </l>
          <l>And with great Wit and Judgment made them good. </l>
          <l>A Humor is the Byas of the Mind, </l>
          <l>By which with violence 'tis one way inclin'd: </l>
          <l>It makes our Actions lean on one side still, </l>
          <l>And in all Changes that way bends the will. </l>
          <l>This— </l>
          <l>He onely knew and represented right. </l>
          <l>Thus none but Mighty Johnson e'r could write. </l>
          <l>Expect not then, since that most flourishing Age, </l>
          <l>Of BEN. to see true Humor on the Stage. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000729-050-a"/>
          <l>All that have since been writ, if they be scan'd, </l>
          <l>Are but faint Copies from that Master's hand. </l>
          <l>Our Poet now, amongst those petty things, </l>
          <l>Alas, his too weak trifling humors brings. </l>
          <l>As much beneath the worst in Johnson's Plays, </l>
          <l>As his great Merit is above our praise. </l>
          <l>For could he imitate that great Author right, </l>
          <l>He would with ease all Poets else out-write. </l>
          <l>But to out-go all other men, would be </l>
          <l>O Noble BEN! less than to follow thee. </l>
          <l>Gallants you see how hard it is to write, </l>
          <l>Forgive all faults the Poet made to night: </l>
          <l>Since if he finn'd, 'twas meant for your delight. </l>
          <l>Pray let this find— </l>
          <l>As good success, tho' it be very bad, </l>
          <l>As any damn'd successful Play e'r had. </l>
          <l>Yet if you hiss, he knows not where the harm is, </l>
          <l>He'll not defend his Non-sence Vi &amp; Armis. </l>
          <l>But this poor Play has been so torn before, </l>
          <l>That all your Cruelty can't wound it more. </l>
