        <head>To the Right Honourable The Earl of ROCHESTER, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>'TIS enough for your Lordship to be conscious to your self of having perform'd a just and honourable Action, in Redeeming this Play from the Persecution of my Enemies; but it wou'd be ingratitude in me, not to publish it to the World. That it has appear'd on the Stage is principally owing to you: That it has succeeded, is the Approbation of your Judgment, by that of the Publick. 'Tis just the Inversion of an Act of Parliament: Your Lordship first sign'd it, and then it was pass'd amongst the Lords and Commons. The Children of old Men are generally observ'd to be short liv'd, and of a weakly Constitution: How this may prove I know not; but hitherto it has promis'd well: And if it survive to Posterity, it will carry the Noble Name of its Patron along with it; or, rather, it will be carried by yours to after Ages. Ariosto, in his <hi>Voyage of </hi>Astolpho <hi>to the Moon</hi>, has given us a fine Allegory of two Swans; who, when Time had thrown the Writings of many Poets into the River of Oblivion, were ever in a readiness to secure the best, and bear them aloft, into the Temple of Immortality. Whether this Poem be of that Number, is left to the Judgment of the Swan who has preserv'd it: And though I can claim little from his Justice, I may presume to value my self upon his Charity. It will be told me, That I have mistaken the Italian Poet, who <pb xml:id="ep000524-003-a"/>means only that some excellent Writers, almost as few in Number as the Swans, have rescued the Memory of their Patrons, from Forgetfulness and Time; when a vast Multitude of Crows and Vultures, that is, bad Scribblers, Parasites, and Flatterers, oppress'd by the weight of the Names which they endeavour'd to redeem, were forc'd to let them fall again into Lethe, where they were lost for ever. If it be thus, my Lord, the Table wou'd be turn'd upon me: But I shou'd only fail in my vain Attempt: For either some other Immortal Swan, will be more capable of sustaining such a weight, or you who have so long been Conversant in the management of great Affairs, are able with your own Pen, to do Justice to your self; and, at the same time, to give the Nation a clearer and more faithful insight into those Transactions, wherein you have Worthily sustain'd so great a part. For to your Experience in State Affairs, you have also joyn'd no vulgar Erudition: Which all your Modesty is not able to conceal; for to understand critically the delicacies of Horace, is a height to which few of our Noble Men have arriv'd: And that this is your deserv'd Commendation, I am a living Evidence; as far, at least, as I can be allow'd a Competent Judge on that subject. Your Affection to that admirable Ode, which Horace writes to his Mecaenas, and which I had the Honour to inscribe to you, is not the only Proof of this Assertion. You may please to remember, that in the late happy Conversation, which I had with your Lordship at a Noble Relations of yours, you took me aside, and pleas'd your Self with repeating to me, one of the most Beautiful Pieces in that Author. It was the Ode to Barine, wherein you were so particularly affected with that Elegant Expression, <pb xml:id="ep000524-003-b"/>
          <hi>Iuvenumque prodis publica cura</hi>. There is indeed the Vertue of a whole Poem, in those words; that <foreign xml:lang="lat">curiosa felicitas</foreign>, which Petronius so justly ascribes to our Author. The Barbarity of our Language is not able to reach it: Yet, when I have leisure, I mean to try, how near I can raise my English to his Latin: Though in the mean time, I cannot but imagine to my self, with what Scorn his Sacred Manes wou'd look on so lame a Translation as I cou'd make. His <foreign xml:lang="lat">Recalcitrat undique tutus </foreign>might more reasonably be apply'd to me, than he himself apply'd it to <hi>Augustus Caesar. </hi>I ought to reckon that Day, as very Fortunate to me, and distinguish it, as the Ancients did, with a whiter Stone; because it furnish'd me with an Occasion of reading my Cleomenes to a Beautiful Assembly of Ladies, where your Lordship's Three Fair Daughters, were pleas'd to Grace it with their Presence: And, if I may have leave to single out any one in particular, there was your admirable Daughter-in-law; shining, not like a Star, but a Constellation of her Self; a more true and brighter Berenice. Then it was, that whether out of your own Partiality, and Indulgence to my Writings, or out of Complaisance to the Fair Company, (who gave the first good Omen to my Success, by their Approbation,) your Lordship was pleas'd to add your own: And afterwards to Represent it to the Queen, as wholly Innocent of those Crimes, which were laid unjustly to its Charge. Neither am I to forget my Charming Patroness; though she will not allow my Publick Address to her, in a Dedication; but Protects me unseen, like my Guardian-Angel; and shuns my Gratitude, like a Fairy, who is Bountiful by stealth; and conceals the Giver, when she bestows the <pb xml:id="ep000524-004-a"/>Gift. But my Lady Sylvius has been juster to me, and pointed out the Goddess, at whose Altar I was to pay my Sacrifice and Thanks Offering. And had she been silent, yet my Lord Chamberlain himself, in restoring my Play, without any Alteration, avow'd to me, that I had the most Earnest Sollicitress, as well as the Fairest; and that nothing cou'd be refus'd to my Lady Hyde. </p>
        <p>These Favours, my Lord, receiv'd from your Self, and your Noble Family, have encourag'd me to this Dedication; wherein I not only give you back a Play, which had you not redeem'd it, had not been mine; but also at the same time, Dedicate to you, the unworthy Author, with my inviolable Faith, and (how mean soever) my utmost Service: And I shall be proud to hold my Dependance on you in Chief, as I do part of my small Fortune in Wiltshire. Your Goodness has not been wanting to me, during the Reign of my two Masters. And even from a bare Treasury, my Success has been contrary to that of Mr. Cowley; and Gideon's Fleece has then been moisten'd, when all the Ground has been dry about it. Such and so many Provocations of this nature, have concurr'd to my Invading of your Modesty, with this Address. I am sensible that it is in a manner forc'd upon you. But your Lordship has been the Aggressor in this Quarrel, by so many Favours, which you are not weary of conferring on me. Though at the same time, I own the Ambition on my side, to be ever esteem'd </p>

        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>'TIs now seven or eight Years since I design'd to write this Play of CLEOMENES; and my Lord Falkland, (whose Name I cannot mention without Honour, for the many Favours I have receiv'd from him) is pleas'd to witness for me, That in a French Book, which I presented him about that time, there were the Names of many Subjects that I had thought on for the Stage; amongst which, this Tragedy was one. This, was out of my Remembrance; but my Lord, on the occasion of stopping my Play, took the Opportunity of doing me a good Office at Court, by representing it as it was, a Piece long ago design'd: Which being judiciously treated, I thought was capable of moving Compassion on the Stage. The Success has justified my Opinion, and that at a time when the World is running mad after Farce, the Extremitie of bad Poetry, or rather the Iudgment that is fallen upon Dramatique Writing. Were I in the Humour, I have sufficient cause to expose it in its true Colours; but having for once escap'd, I will forbear my Satyr, and only be thankful for my Deliverance. A great part of my good Fortune, I must confess, is owing to the Iustice which was done me in the Performance: I can scarcely refrain from giving every one of the Actors their particular Commendations; but none of them will be offended, if I say what the Town has generally granted, That Mrs. Barry, always Excellent, has, in this Tragedy, excell'd Herself, and gain'd a Reputation beyond any Woman whom I have ever seen on the Theatre. After all, it was a bold Attempt of mine, to write upon a single Plott, unmix'd with Comedy; which though it be the natural and true way, yet is not to the Genius of the Nation. Yet to gratifie the barbarous Party of my Audience, I gave them a short Rabble-Scene, because the Mobb (as they call them) are represented by Plutarch and Polybius, with the same Character of Baseness and Cowardice, which are here describ'd, in the last Attempt of Cleomenes. They may thank me, if they please, for this Indulgence; for no French Poet would have allow'd them any more than a bare <pb xml:id="ep000524-005-a"/>Relation of that Scene, which debases a Tragedy to show upon the Stage </p>
        <p>For the rest, some of the Mechanique Rules of Vnity are observed, and others are neglected. The Action is but one, which is the Death of Cleomenes; and every Scene in the Play, is tending to the Accomplishment of the Main Design. The Place is likewise one; for 'tis all in the compass of Alexandria, and the Port of that City. The time might easily have been reduc'd into the space of twenty four Hours, if I wou'd have omitted the Scence of Famine, in the Fifth Act; but it pleas'd me to try how Spartans cou'd endure it; and, besides, gave me the occasion of writing that other Scene, betwixt Cleomenes and his suspected Friend; and, in such a Case, 'tis better to trespass on a Rule, than leave out a Beauty. </p>
        <p>As for other Objections, I never heard any worth answering; and least of all that Foolish One, which is rais'd against me by the Sparks, for Cleomenes not accepting the Favours of Cassandra. They wou'd not have refus'd a fair Lady. I grant they wou'd not; but let them grant me, That they are not Hero's; and so much for the Point of Honour. A Man might have pleaded an Excuse for himself, if he had been false to an Old Wife, for the sake of a Young Mistress; but Cleora was in the Flower of her Age, and it was yet but Honey-moon with Cleomenes; and so much for Nature. Some have told me, That many of the fair Sex complain for want of tender Scenes, and soft Expressions of Love: I will endeavour to make them some amends, if I write again; and my next Hero shall be no Spartan. </p>
        <p>I know it will be here expected, that I should write somewhat concerning the forbidding of my Play; but the less I say of it, the better. And besides, I was so little concern'd at it, that had it not been on consideration of the Actors, who were to suffer on my account, I should not have been at all sollicitous, whether it were play'd, or no. No body can imagine, that in my declining Age I write willingly, or that I am desirous of exposing, at this time of day, the small Reputation which I have gotten on the Theatre. The Subsistence which I had from the former Government, is lost; and the Reward I have from the Stage is so little, that it is not worth my Labour. </p>
        <p>As for the Reasons which were given for suspending the Play, it seems they were so ill founded, that my Lord Chamberlain no sooner took the pains to read it, but they vanish'd; and my Copy was restor'd to me, without the least Alteration by his Lordship. 'Tis printed as <pb xml:id="ep000524-005-b"/>it was acted; and I dare assure you, that here is no Parallel to be found: 'Tis neither Compliment, nor Satyr; but a plain Story, more strictly followed than any which has appear'd upon the Stage. 'Tis true, it had been garbled before by the Superiours of the Play-house; and I cannot reasonably blame them for their Caution; because they are answerable for any thing that is publickly represented: And their Zeal for the Government is such, that they had rather lose the best Poetry in the World, than give the least Suspicion of their Loyalty. The short is, that they were diligent enough to make sure Work: and to geld it so clearly in some places, that they took away the very Manhood of it. I can only apply to them, what Cassandra says somewhere in the Play to Ptolomey; <q>
            <l>To be so nice in my Concerns for you; </l>
            <l>To doubt where Doubts are not; to be too fearful; </l>
            <l>To raise a Bug-bear Shadow of a Danger; </l>
            <l>And then be frighted, though it cannot reach you. </l>
          </q>

        <p>But, since it concerns me to be as circumspect as they are, I have given leave to my Bookseller to print the Life of Cleomenes, as it is elegantly, and faithfully translated out of Plutarch, by my learned Friend, Mr. Creech; to whom the World has been indebted for his excellent Version of Lucretius; and I particularly oblig'd in his Translation of Horace. We daily expect Manilius from him; an Author worthy only of such Hands; which having formerly reveal'd the Secrets of Nature to us here on Earth, is now discovering to us her Palace in the Skies; and if I might be allow'd to say it, giving Light to the Stars of Heaven. </p>

          <l>Processit long&#232;, flammantia maenia Mundi. </l>
        </q>
        <p>But to return to Plutarch; you will find him particularly fond of Cleomenes his Character; who as he was the last of the Spartan Heroes, so he was, in my Opinion, the greatest. Even his Enemy, Polybius, though engag'd in the contrary Faction, yet speaks honourably of him; and especially of his last Action in Egypt. This Author is also made English, and will shortly be publish'd for the Common Benefit. </p>
        <p>What I have added to the Story, is chiefly the Love of Agathoclea, the King's Mistress; whose Name I have chang'd into Cassandra; only for the better sound. As I have also the name of <pb xml:id="ep000524-006-a"/>Nicagoras, into that of Coenus, for the same Reason. <hi>Cratisiclaea, Pantheus</hi>, and Sosybius, are to be found in the Story, with the same Characters which they have in the Tragedy. There is likewise mention made of the Son of Cleomenes, who had resolution enough to throw himself headlong from a Tower, when he had heard of his Father's ill Success. And for Cleora, whom I make the second Wife of Cleomenes (for Aegyatis was dead before) you will find a hint of her in Plutarch; for he tells us, That after the loss of the Battle at Sellasia, he return'd to Sparta, and entring his own House, was there attended by a Free-born Woman of Megalopolis. </p>
        <p>The Picture of <hi>Ptolomey Philopater</hi>, is given by the fore-mention'd Authors to the full. Both agree that he was an Original of his kind; a Lazy, Effeminate, Cowardly, Cruel, and Luxurious Prince, manag'd by his Favourite, and impos'd on by his Mistress. The Son of Sosybyus, whom I call Cleanthes, was a Friend to Cleomenes: but Plutarch says, he at length forsook him. I have giv'n him a fairer Character, and made it only a seeming Treachery, which he practis'd. If any be so curious to enquire what became of Cassandra, whose Fortune was left in suspence at the Conclusion of the Play, I must first inform them, that after the death of Cleomenes, (the Heroe of my Poem,) I was oblig'd by the Laws of the Drama, to let fall the Curtain immediately; because the Action was then concluded. But Polybius tells us, that she surviv'd Ptolomey, who reign'd about Twenty seven Years; that with her Brother Agathocles, she govern'd Egypt in the Minority of his Son <hi>Ptolomey Epiphanes</hi>; and that finally for oppressing of the People, both the Brother and Sister were slain in a popular Insurrection. </p>
        <p>There is nothing remaining, but my Thanks to the Town in general, and to the fair Ladies in particular, for their kind Reception of my Play. And though I cannot retract what I said before, that I was not much concern'd in my own particular, for the Embargo which was laid upon it: Yet I think my self oblig'd, at the same time, to render my Acknowledgments to those Honourable Persons, who were instrumental in the freeing it. For as it was from a Principle of Nobleness in them, that they would not suffer one to want, who was grown old in their Service: So it is from a Principle of another sort, that I have learn'd to possess my Soul in Patience, and not to be much disquieted, with any Disappointment of this Nature. </p>

        <head>THE LIFE OF CLEOMENES. </head>
        <p>THus fell Agis. His Brother Archidamus was too quick for Leonidas, and sav'd himself by a timely Retreat. But his Wife then newly brought to Bed, the Tyrant forc'd her from her own House, and compell'd her to marry his Son Cleomenes, though at that time too young for a Wife; for he was unwilling that any one else should have her, she being Heiress to her Father Gylippus's great Estate; for Person, the finest Woman in all Greece, very good-natur'd, of an exemplary Life, and therefore, they say, she did all she could, that she might not be compell'd to this Match. </p>
        <p>Being thus married to Cleomenes, she hated Leonidas, but to the Youth she show'd her self a kind and obliging Wife. He, as soon as they came together, began to love her very much, and the constant Kindness that she still retain'd for the memory of Agis, wrought somewhat of Concern in the young Man for him, so that he would often enquire of her concerning what had pass'd, and attentively listen to the Story of Agis's Designs. Now Cleomenes had a generous and great Soul; he was as temperate and moderate in his Pleasures as Agis, but not so very cautious, circumspect and gentle: a spur of Passion always gall'd him, and his eagerness to pursue that which he thought good and just, was violent and heady. To make Men willing to obey, he conceiv'd to be the best Discipline; <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000524-008-a"/>but likewise to break the stubborn, and force them to be better, was in his opinion commendable and brave. This Disposition made him dislike the management of the City: The Citizens lay dissolv'd in supine Idleness and Pleasures; the King minded nothing, designing, if no body gave him any disturbance, to waste his Time in Ease and Riot; the Publick was neglected, and each Man intent upon his private Gain. 'Twas dangerous, now Agis was kill'd, to mention the exercising and training of their Youth, and to set up for the ancient Bravery and Equality, was Treason against the State. 'Tis said also that Cleomenes, whilst a Boy, studied Philosophy under Sphaerus the Borystenite, who coming to Sparta, was very diligent in Instructing the Youth: Sphaerus was one of the chief of Zeno the Citiean's Scholars, and 'tis likely that he admir'd the manly Temper of Cleomenes, and inflam'd his generous Ambition. The ancient Leonidas (as Story saith) being ask'd, What manner of Poet he thought Tyrtaeus? reply'd, An excellent one to whet the Courages of youth, for being fill'd with Fury by his Poems, they daringly ventur'd on any Danger: now the Stoicks Philosophy is a dangerous Incentive to hot and fiery Dispositions, but being mixt with a grave and cautious Temper, is very good to fix and settle the Resolutions. </p>
        <p>Upon the Death of his Father Leonidas, he succeeded, and observing the Citizens of all sorts to be debauch'd, the rich neglecting the Publick, and intent on their own Gain and Pleasure, and the poor being crampt in their private Fortunes, grown unactive, Cowards, and not inclinable to the Spartan Institution and way of Breeding, that he had only the Name of King, and the Ephori all the Power, was resolv'd to change the present posture of Affairs. He had a Friend whose name was Xenares, his Lover, (such an Affection the Spartans express by the word, <seg xml:lang="unk">&#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297;</seg>) him he sounded and of him he would commonly enquire, What manner of King Agis was, by what means, and by what Assistance he began and pursu'd his Designs. Xenares at first willingly comply'd with his Request, and told him the whole Story, with all the particular Circumstances of the Actions. But when he observ'd Cleomenes to be extreamly affected at the Relation, and more than ordinarily mov'd at Agis's new model of the Government, and begging <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000524-008-b"/>a repetition of the Story, he at first severely chid him, told him, He was frantick, and at last left off all sort of Familiarity and Conversation with him, yet he never told any Man the cause of their Disagreement, but would only say, <hi>Cleomenes knew very well. Cleomenes </hi>finding Xenares averse to his Designs, and thinking all others to be of the same opinion, consulted with none, but contriv'd the whole Business by himself. And considering that it would be easier to bring about an Alteration when the City was at War, than when in Peace, he engag'd the Commonwealth in a Quarrel with the Achaeans, who had given them fair occasions to complain: for Aratus, a Man of the greatest Power amongst all the Achaeans, design'd from the very beginning to bring all the Peloponnesians into one common Body. And to effect this, he undertook many Expeditions, and ran through a long course of Policy; for he thought this the only means to make them an equal Match for their foreign Enemies: All the rest agreed to his Proposals, only the Lacedaemonians, the Eleans, and as many of the Arcadians as inclin'd to the Spartan Interest, refus'd. Therefore as soon as Leonidas was dead, he fell upon the Arcadians, and wasted those especially that border'd on Achaia; by this means designing to try the Inclinations of the Spartans, and despising Cleomenes as a Youth, and of no experience in Affairs of State or War. Upon this the Ephori sent Cleomenes to surprise the Athenaeum (dedicated to Minerva) near Belbina, which is a pass of Laconia, and was then under the Jurisdiction of the <hi>Megalopolitans: Cleomenes </hi>possest himself of the place, and fortified it; at which Action Aratus shew'd no publick Resentment, but marcht by night to surprise Tegea and Orchomenium. The Design fail'd; for those that were to betray the Cities into his Hands, doubted the Success; so Aratus retreated, imagining that his Design had been undiscovered: But Cleomenes wrote a jeering Letter to him, and desired to know, as from a Friend, whither he intended to march at night? And Aratus answering, That having understood his Design to fortifie Belbina, he resolv'd to march thither to oppose him. Cleomenes return'd, That he believed it, but desir'd him to give him an account, if it stood with his Convenience, why he carryed those Torches and Ladders with him. </p>
        <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000524-009-a"/>
        <p>Aratus laughing at the Jeer, and asking what manner of Youth this was; Democrites a Spartan Exile replyed, <hi>If you have any Designs upon the </hi>Lacedaemonians, <hi>begin before this young Eagle's Talons are grown. </hi>Presently after this, Cleomenes being in Arcadia with a few Horse, and 300 Foot, the Ephori fearing to engage in the War, commanded him home, but upon his Retreat, Aratus taking Caphuae, they commission'd him again. In this Expedition he took Methudrium, and spoiled the Country of the Argives, and the Achaians: to stop his Victory, and secure their Friends, sent 20000 foot and 1000 Horse against him, under the Command of <hi>Aristomachus. Cleomenes </hi>fac'd them at Palantium, and offer'd Battle: But Aratus being dash'd at his Bravery, would not suffer the General to engage, but retreated, being curst by the Achaeans, and hooted at, and scorn'd by the Spartans, who were not above 5000, for a Coward. Cleomenes encouraged by this Success, began to vaunt among the Citizens a Sentence of one of their ancient Kings, who said, The Spartans <hi>seldom enquired how many their Enemies were, but where they were. </hi>After this, marching to the Assistance of the Eleans, upon whom the Achaians warr'd, and about Lycaeum falling upon the Enemy in their Retreat, he routed their whole Army, taking a great number of Captives, and leaving many dead upon the Place; so that it was commonly reported amongst the Greeks that Aratus was slain. But Aratus making the best Advantage of the Opportunity, presently after the Defear, march'd to Mantinaea, and before any body suspected it, took the City, and put a new Garrison into it. Upon this the Lacedaemonians being quite discouraged, and opposing Cleomenes's Design of carrying on the War, he was eager to send for Archidamus, Agis's Brother from Messena, for he of the other Family had a Right to the Kingdom; and beside, Cleomenes thought that the Power of the Ephori would be abated when the Kingly State was fill'd up, and equally poised between the two Families. But those that were concern'd in the Murder of Agis understanding the Design, and fearing that upon Archidamus's Return they should be call'd to an Account, receiv'd him coming privately into Town, waited on him, and presently after murder'd him; but whether Cleomenes was against it (as Phylarchus imagines) or whether he was perswaded by his Friends, and wink'd at the Contrivance, is uncertain; <pb n="5" xml:id="ep000524-009-b"/>however, they were most blam'd, as having forc'd his Consent. But he still resolving to new-model the State, brib'd the Ephori to make him General: and won the Affections of many others by means of his Mother Cratesiclaea, who spared no Cost, and was very zealous to promote the same Interest; and though of her self she had no Inclination to marry, yet for her Son's sake she wedded one of the chiefest Citizens for Wealth and Power. Cleomenes marching forth with the Army now under his Command, took Leuctra, a place belonging to Megalopolis; and the Achaeans quickly facing him with a good body of Men commanded by Aratus in a Battle under the very Walls of the City, some part of his Army was routed. But Aratus commanding the Achaeans not to pass a deep Hollow, and stopping the Pursuit, Lydiadas the Megalopolitan fretting at the Orders, encouraging the Horse which he led, and pursuing the routed Enemy, fell into a place full of Vines, Hedges and Ditches; and being forc'd to break his Ranks, was put into a great Disorder. Cleomenes observing the Advantage, commanded the Tarentines and Cretans to engage him, by whom, after a brave Dispute he was routed and slain. The Lacedaemonians thus encouraged with a great shout fell upon the Achaeans and routed their whole Army. Of the slain, which were very many, some Cleomenes delivered upon Articles, but the Body of Lydiadas he commanded to be brought to him; and then putting on it a purple Robe, and a Crown upon its Head, sent a Convoy with it to the Gates of Megalopolis. This Lydiadas was the Man that resign'd his Crown, restor'd Liberty to the Citizens, and joyn'd the City to the Achaean Interest. Cleomenes being very much raised by this Success; and perswaded, that if matters were wholly at his Disposal, he should quickly be too hard for the Achaeans. He taught Megistones his Mother's Husband, That 'twas expedient for the State to shake off the Power of the Ephori, and to put all their Wealth into one common Stock for the whole Body; That Sparta being restor'd to its old Equality, might be rais'd up to be Mistriss of all <hi>Greece. Megistones </hi>liked the Design, and engaged two or three more of his Friends. About that time one of the Ephori sleeping in Pasiphae's Temple, dream'd a very surprizing Dream; for he thought he saw the four Chairs removed out <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000524-010-a"/>of the place where the Ephori used to sit and hear Causes, and one only set there; and whilst he wondred, he heard a Voice out of the Temple, saying, <hi>This is best for </hi>Sparta. The Person telling Cleomenes this Dream, he was a little troubled at first, fearing that he us'd this as a Trick to sift him, upon some Suspicion of his Design; but when he was satisfied that the Relater spoke truth, he took heart again; and taking with him those whom he thought would be against his model, he took Eraea and Alcaea, two Cities of the Achaeans, furnish'd Orchomenium with Provisions, besieg'd Mantinaea; and with long marches so harass'd the Lacedaemonians, that many of them desir'd to be left in Arcadia; and he satisfy'd their Request. With the Mercenaries he march'd to Sparta, and by the way communicated his Design to those whom he thought fittest for his Purpose, and march'd slowly that he might catch the Ephori at Supper. When he was come near the City, he sent Eurycleidas to the Sussitium, the eating place of the Ephori, under pretence of carrying some Message from him from the Army; <hi>Threicion, Phaebis</hi>, and two of those which were bred with Cleomenes, which they call Samothracae, follow'd with a few Souldiers; And whilst Eurycleidas was delivering his Message to the Ephori, they ran upon them with their drawn Swords, and slew them. Agesilaus as soon as he was run through, fell, and lay as dead; but in a little time he rose, silently convey'd himself out of the Room, and crept undiscover'd into a little House, which was the Temple of Fear, and which always us'd to be shut, but was then by chance open; being got in, he shut the Door, and lay close: the other four were kill'd, and above ten more that came to their Assistance; to those that were quiet, they did no harm, stopt none that fled the City, and spar'd Agesilaus, who came out of the Temple the next day. The Lacedaemonians have not only Temples dedicated to Fear, but also to <hi>Death, Laughter</hi>, and the like Passions: now they worship Fear, not as they do those Deities which they dread, esteeming it hurtfull, but thinking their Polity is chiefly kept up by Law; and therefore the Ephori (Aristotle is my Author) when they enter upon their Government, make Proclamation to the People, that they should shave their Whiskers, and be obedient to the Laws, that they might not be forc'd to be severe, using this <pb n="7" xml:id="ep000524-010-b"/>trivial Particular (in my opinion) to accustom their Youth to Obedience even in the smallest Matters. And the Ancients, I think, did not imagine Fortitude to be plain fearlessness, but a cautious Fear of Infamy and Disgrace: for those that show most Fear towards the Laws, are most bold against their Enemies; and those are least afraid of any Danger, who are most afraid of a just reproach. Therefore he said well: <q>
            <l>A Reverence still attends on Fear. </l>
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>And Homer, <q>
            <l>Fear'd you shall be, dear Vncle, and rever'd. </l>
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>And again, <q>
            <l>In silence fearing those that bore the sway. </l>
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>For 'tis very commonly seen, that Men reverence those whom they fear; and therefore the Lacedaemonians plac'd the Temple of Fear by the Sussitium of the Ephori, having rais'd their Power to almost absolute Monarchy. </p>
        <p>The next day Cleomenes proscrib'd 80 of the Citizens, whom he thought necessary to banish, and removed all the Seats of the Ephori except one, in which he himself design'd to sit, and hear Causes; and calling the Citizens together, he made an Apology for his Proceedings, saying, That by Lycurgus the Senate was joyn'd to the Kings, and that that model of Government had continued a long time, and needed no other sort of Magistrates to give it perfection. But afterward in the long War with the Messenians, when the Kings being to command the Army, had no time to attend civil Causes, they chose some of their Friends, and left them to determine the Suits of the Citizens in their stead. These were call'd Ephori, and at first behav'd themselves as Servants to the Kings, but afterward by degrees they appropriated the Power to themselves, and erected a distinct sort of Magistracy. An evidence of the Truth of this may be taken from the usual Behaviour of the Kings, who upon the first and second Message of the Ephori, refuse to go, but upon the third readily attend them: <pb n="8" xml:id="ep000524-011-a"/>And Asteropus, the first that rais'd the Ephori to that height of Power, liv'd a great many years after their Institution; therefore whil'st they modestly contain'd themselves within their own proper Sphear, 'twas better to bear with them than to make a disturbance. But that an upstart introduc'd Power should so far destroy the old model of Government, as to banish some Kings, murder others without hearing their defence, and threaten those who desir'd to see the best and most divine Constitution restor'd in Sparta, was unsufferable. Therefore if it had been possible for him without Bloodshed, to have freed Lacedaemon from those foreign Plagues, Luxury, Vanity, Debts and Usury, and from those more ancient Evils, Poverty and Riches, he should have thought himself the happiest King in the World, having like an expert Physician cur'd the Diseases of his Countrey without pain. But now in this necessity Lycurgus's Example favour'd his Proceedings, who being neither King, nor Magistrate, but a private Man, and aiming at the Kingdom, came arm'd into the Market-place, and for fear of the King Carileus fled to the Altar: but he being a good Man, and a lover of his Countrey, readily consented to Lycurgus's Project, and admitted an Alteration in the State. Thus by his own Actions Lycurgus show'd, That it was difficult to correct the Government without Force and Fear, in using which, he said, he would be so moderate, as never to desire their Assistance, but either to terrifie or ruine the Enemies of Sparta's Happiness and Safety. He commanded that all the Land should be left in common, and private Claims laid aside: That Debtors should be discharged of their Debts, and a strict search made, who were Foreigners, and who not: That the true Spartans, recovering their Courage, might defend the City by their Arms, and that we may no longer see Laconia, for want of a sufficient number to secure it, wasted by the Aetolians and Illyrians. Then he himself first, with his Father-in-law Megistones, and his Friends, brought all their Wealth into one publick Stock, and all the other Citizens follow'd the example: the Land was divided, and every one that he had banish'd, had a share assign'd him; for he promis'd to restore all, as soon as things were settled and in quiet; and compleating the common number of Citizens, out of the best <pb n="9" xml:id="ep000524-011-b"/>and most agreeable of the neighbouring Inhabitants, he rais'd a Body of 4000 Men, and instead of a Spear, taught them to use a Sarissa, (a long Pike) with both hands, and to carry their Shields by a String fastned round their Arms, and not by a Handle, as before. After this he began to consult about the exercising and breeding of the Youth, (many Particulars of which, Sphaerus being then at Sparta, directed) and in a short time the Schools of Exercise, and their Sussitia, (common eating Places) recover'd their ancient Decency and Order, a few out of necessity, but the most voluntarily applying themselves to that generous and Laconick way of Living: besides, that the Name of Monarch might give them no jealousie, he made Eucleidas, his Brother, Partner in the Throne; and that was the only time that Sparta had two Kings of the same Family. Then understanding that the Achaeans and Aratus imagin'd that this Change had disturb'd and shaken his Affairs, and that he would not venture out of Sparta, and leave the City now unsettled by so great an Alteration, he thought it great and serviceable to his Designs, to convince his Enemies that he was eagerly desirous of a War: And therefore making an Incursion into the Territories of Megalopolis, he wasted the Countrey very much, and got a considerable Booty. And at last taking those that us'd to act in the publick Solemnities travelling from Messena, and building a Theater in the Enemies Countrey, and setting a Prize of 40 l. value, he sate Spectator a whole day; not that he either desir'd or needed such a Divertisement, but as it were insulting o're his Enemies, and that by thus manifestly despising them, he might show that he had more than conquer'd the Achaeans: For that alone of all the Greek or Kings Armies had no Stage-players, no Juglers, no dancing or singing Women attending it, but was free from all sorts of Loosness, Wantonness and Foppery; the young Men being for the most part upon Duty, and the old Men teaching them at leisure time to apply themselves to their usual Drollery, and to rally one another facetiously after the Laconick fashion; the Advantages of which I have discover'd in the Life of Lycurgus. He himself instructed all by his Example: he was a living Pattern of Temperance before every bodies eyes, and his course of Living was neither more stately nor more expensive than any of the Commons. And this was a considerable Advantage to him in his Designs on Greece; for Men when they waited upon other Kings, did not so much admire their Wealth, costly Furniture, and numerous Attendance, as they hated their Pride and State, their difficulty of Access, and scornful commanding Answers to their Petitions. <pb n="10" xml:id="ep000524-012-a"/>But when they came to Cleomenes, who was both really a King, and bore that Title, and saw no Purple, no Robes of State upon him, no Chairs and Couches about him for his ease, and that he did not receive Petitions, and return Answers after a long delay, by a number of Messengers, Waiters, or by Bills, but that he rose and came forward to meet those that came to wait upon him, staid, talk'd freely and graciously with all that had Business, they were extreamly taken, won to his Service, and profess'd that he alone was the true Son of Hercules. His common every days Meal was in a mean Room, very sparing, and after the Laconick manner; and when he entertain'd Ambassadors or Strangers, two more Beds were added, and a little better Dinner provided by his Servants; but no Fricacies, no Dainties, only the Dishes were larger, and the Wine more plentiful; for he reprov'd one of his Friends for entertaining some Strangers, with nothing but Pulse and black Broth, such Diet as they usually had in their Phiditia, saying, That upon such occasions, and when they treat Strangers, 'twas not requisite to be too exact Laconians. After Supper, a Stand was brought in with a brass Vessel full of Wine, two silver Pots, which held almost a Quart apiece, a few silver Cups, of which he that pleas'd might drink, but no Liquor was forc'd on any of the Guests. There was no Musick, nor was any requir'd; for he entertain'd the Company, sometimes asking Questions, sometimes telling Stories: And his Discourse was neither too grave, and unpleasantly serious, nor vain and abusive, but merrily facetious; for he thought those ways of catching Men by Gifts and Presents, which other Kings use, to be mean and inartificial; and it seem'd to him to be the most glorious method, and most suitable to a King, to win the Affections of those that came near him, by pleasant Discourse, and unaffected Conversation: for a Friend and Mercenary differ only in this, that the one is made by Conversation and Agreeableness of Humour, and the other by Reward. The Mantineans were the first that oblig'd him; for getting by night into the City, and driving out the Achaean Garrison, they put themselves under his Protection: he restor'd them their Polity and Laws, and the same day march'd to Tegea; and a little while after fetching a Compass through Arcadia, he made a descent upon Pherae in Achaia, intending to force Aratus to a Battel, or bring him into Disrepute, for refusing to engage, and suffering him to wast the Countrey: Hyperbatus at that time commanded the Army, but Aratus had all the Power amongst the Achaeans. The Achaeans marching forth with their <pb n="11" xml:id="ep000524-012-b"/>whole Strength, and incamping in Dumaeae, about <hi>Hecatombaeum, Cleomenes </hi>came up, and thinking it not advisable to pitch between Dumaeae, a City of the Enemies, and the Camp of the Achaeans, he boldly dar'd the Achaeans, and forc'd them to a Battel, and routing the Phalanx, slew a great many in the Fight, and took many Prisoners; thence marching to Lagon, and driving out the Achaean Garrison, he restor'd the City to the Elaeans. The Affairs of the Achaeans being in this desperate condition, Aratus, who was wont to continue in his Government above a year, refus'd the Command, though they entreated and urg'd him to accept it; and this was ill done, when the Storm was high, to put the Power out of his own hands, and set another to the Helm. Cleomenes at first propos'd fair and easie Conditions by his Ambassadors to the Achaeans; but afterward he sent others, and requir'd the chief Command to be settled upon him; and in other Matters he promis'd to agree to reasonable Terms, and to restore their Captives and their Countrey. The Achaeans were willing to come to an agreement upon those terms, and invited Cleomenes to Lerna, where an Assembly was to be held; but it hapned that Cleomenes hastily marching on, and unreasonably drinking Water, brought up abundance of Blood, and lost his Voice: therefore being unable to continue his March, he sent the chiefest of the Captives to the Achaeans, and putting off the Meeting for some time retir'd to Lacedaemon. This ruin'd the Affairs of Greece, which was just then ready to recover it self out of its Disasters, and avoid the insulting and Covetousness of the Macedonians: for Aratus, whether fearing or distrusting Cleomenes, or envying his unlook'd-for Success, or thinking it a disgrace for him who had commanded 33 years, to have a young Man succeed to all his Glory and his Power, and be Head of that Government which he had been raising and setling so many years; he first endeavour'd to keep the Achaeans from closing with Cleomenes; but when they would not hearken to him, fearing Cleomenes's daring Spirit, and thinking the Lacedaemonian's Proposals to be very reasonable who design'd only to reduce Peloponnesus to its old Model, he took his last Refuge, in an Action which was unbecoming any of the Greeks, most dishonourable to him, and most unworthy his former Bravery and Exploits: for he call'd Antigonus into Greece, and fill'd Peloponnesus with Macedonians, whom he himself, when a Youth, having beaten their Garrison out of the Castle of Corinth, had driven from the same Countrey; beside he declar'd himself an Enemy to all Kings, and hath left many dishonourable Stories of this same Antigonus, in those Commentaries <pb n="12" xml:id="ep000524-013-a"/>which he wrote. And though he declares that he suffer'd considerable Losses, and underwent great dangers, that he might free Athens from the Power of the Macedonians, yet afterward he brought the very same Men arm'd into his own Countrey, and his own House, even to the Womens Apartment. He would not endure, that one of the Family of Hercules, and King of Sparta, and one that had reform'd the Polity of his Countrey, as it were a disorder'd Harmony, and tun'd it to the plain Dorick measure of Lycurgus, to be styl'd, Head of the Triccaeans and Sicyonians; and whilst he fled the Pulse and short Coat, and, which were his chief Accusations against Cleomenes, the extirpation of Wealth, and reformation of Poverty, he basely subjected himself, together with Achaea, to the Diadem and Purple, to the imperious Commands of the Macedonians, and their Satrapae. That he might not seem to be under Cleomenes, he sacrific'd the Antigonea, (Sacrifices in Honour of Antigonus) and sung Paeans himself with a Garland on his Head, to the Honour of a rotten, consumptive Macedonian. </p>
        <p>I write this not out of any design to disgrace Aratus (for in many things he shew'd himself vigorous for the Graecian Interest, and a great Man) but out of pity to the weakness of Humane Nature, which, in such a Person so excellent, and so many ways disposed to Vertue, cannot attain to a State irreprehensible. The Achaeans meeting again at Argos, and Cleomenes descending from Tegea, there were great hopes that all Differences would be compos'd. But <hi>Aratus, Antigonus</hi>, and He having already agreed upon the chief Articles of their League, fearing that Cleomenes would carry all before him, and either win, or force the Multitude to comply with his Demands, propos'd, that, having three hundred Hostages put into his Hands, he should come alone into the Town, or bring his Army to the place of Exercise, call'd Cillarabion, without the City, and treat there. </p>
        <p>Cleomenes hearing this, said, That he was unjustly dealt with; for they ought to have told him so plainly at first, and not now he was come even to their Doors, show their Jealousie, and deny him Admission: and writing an Epistle to the Achaeans about the same Subject; the greatest part of which was an Accusation of Aratus; and Aratus, on the other side, ripping up his Faults to the Assembly, he hastily dislodg'd; and sent a Trumpeter to denounce War against the Achaeans, but not to Argos, but to Aegium, as Aratus delivers, that he might not give them notice enough to make Provision for their Defence. Upon this, the Achaeans were mightily disturb'd, the common People expecting a Division <pb n="13" xml:id="ep000524-013-b"/>of the Land, and a Release from their Debts; and the chief Men being on many Accounts displeas'd with Aratus, and some Angry and at odds with him, as the occasion of the Macedonians descent on Peloponnesus. Encouraged by these Misunderstandings, Cleomenes invades Achaea; and first took Pellene by surprise, and beat out the Achaean Garrison; and afterward brought over Pheneon and Pentelaeon to his side. Now the Achaeans suspecting some treacherous Designs at Corinth and Sicyon, sent their Horse and Mercenaries out of Argos to have an Eye upon those Cities, and they themselves went to Argos to celebrate the Nemean Games. Cleomenes advertis'd of this march, and hoping (as it afterward fell out) that upon an unexpected Advance to the City now busied in the Solemnity of the Games, and throng'd with numerous Spectators he should raise a considerable Terror and Confusion amongst them; by night he march'd with his Army to the Walls, and taking the quarter of the Town call'd Aspis, which lies above the Theater, a place well fortify'd, and hard to be approach'd, he so terrify'd them, that none offer'd to resist, but agreed to accept a Garrison, to give twenty Citizens for Hostages, and to assist the Lacedaemonians, and that he should have the chief Command. This Action considerably encreas'd his Reputation, and his Power; for the ancient Spartan Kings, though they many ways endeavour'd to effect it, could never bring Argos to be stedfastly and sincerely theirs. And Pyrrhus a most experienc'd Captain, and brave Souldier, though be entred the City by force, could not keep Possession, but was slain himself with a considerable part of his Army: Therefore they admir'd the Dispatch and Contrivance of Cleomenes; and those that before derided him for saying that he imitated Solon and Lycurgus in releasing the People from their debts, and in equally dividing the Wealth of the Citizens, were now perswaded that he was the cause of the desirable Alterations in the Spartan Common-wealth: For before they were very low in the World, and so unable to secure their own that the Aetolians invading Laconia, brought away fifty thousand Slaves; (so that one of the elder Spartans is reported to have said, That <hi>They had done </hi>Laconia <hi>a kindness by unburdening it</hi>) and yet a little while after applying themselves to their own Customs, and ancient Institution, they gave notable Instances of Courage as Obedience, and if they had been under the Eye of Lycurgus himself; and quickly rais'd Sparta to be Head of all Greece, and recover'd Peloponnesus to themselves. Whilst Argos was taken, and Cleonae and Philius sided with <hi>Cleomenes, Aratus </hi>was at Corinth searching <pb n="14" xml:id="ep000524-014-a"/>after some, who were reported to favour the Spartan Interest. The News being brought to him, disturb'd him very much; for he perceiv'd the City inclining to Cleomenes, and the Achaeans willing to be at ease; therefore he call'd all the Citizens into the common Hall, and, as it were undesignedly retreating to the Gate, he mounted his Horse that stood ready there, and fled to Sicyon; and the Corinthians made such hast to Cleomenes at Argos, that (as Aratus says) striving who should be first there, they spoil'd all their Horses: and Cleomenes was very angry with the Corinthians for letting Aratus escape: And Megistones came from Cleomenes to him, desiring him to deliver up the Castle of Corinth, which was then garrison'd by the Achaeans, and offer'd him a considerable Sum of Money; and that he answered, That <hi>Matters were not now in his Power, but he in theirs. </hi>Thus Aratus himself writes. But Cleomenes marching from Argos, and taking in the <hi>Traezenians, Epidaurians</hi>, and Hermioneans, came to Corinth, and block'd up the Castle which the Achaeans would not surrender; and sending for Aratus's Friends and Stewards, committed his House and Estate to their Care and Management; and sent Tritimallus the Messenian to him a second time, desiring that the Castle might be equally garrison'd by the Spartans and Achaeans, and promising to Aratus himself double the Pension that he receiv'd from King Ptolomy: But Aratus refusing the Conditions, and sending his own Son with other Hostages to Antigonus, and perswading the Achaeans to make a Decree for delivering the Castle into Antigonus's Hands, Cleomenes invaded the Territority of the Sicyonians, and by a Decree of the Corinthians, seiz'd on all Aratus's Estate. In the mean time Antigonus, with a great Army, pass'd Gerania, and Cleomenes thinking it more adviseable to fortifie and garrison, not the Isthmus, but the Mountains called Onia, and by a long Siege and Skirmishes to weary the Macedonians, than to venture a set Battle, put his Design in Execution, which very much distress'd Antigonus; for he had not brought Victuals sufficient for his Army; nor was it easie to force a way through whilst Cleomenes guarded the Pass. He attempted by night to pass through Lechaeum, but fail'd, and lost some Men; so that Cleomenes and his Army were mightily encouraged, and so flusht with the Victory, and they went merrily to Supper; and Antigonus was very much dejected, being reduc'd to those miserable straits. At last he design'd to march to the Promontory Heraeum, and thence transport his Army in Boats to Sicyon, which would take up a great deal of time, and be very chargeable. The same time about Evening <pb n="15" xml:id="ep000524-014-b"/>some of Aratus's Friends came from Argos by Sea, and invited him to return, for the Argives would revolt from <hi>Cleomenes. Aristotle </hi>was the Man that wrought the Revolt, and he had no hard task to perswade the common People; for they were all angry with Cleomenes for not releasing them from their Debts as they expected. Upon this Advertisement Aratus with fifteen hundred of Antigonus's Souldiers fail'd to Epidaurus; but Aristotle not staying for his coming, drew out the Citizens, and fought against the Garrison of the Castle, and Timoxenus with the Achaeans from Sicyon, came to his Assistance. Cleomenes heard the News about the second Watch of the Night, and sending for Megistones angrily commanded him to go and set things right at Argos. This Megistones was the Man who pass'd his word for the Argives Loyalty, and perswaded him not to banish the suspected. This Megistones he dispatch'd with two thousand Souldiers, and observ'd Antigonus himself, and encouraged the Corinthians, pretending that there was no great matter in the Stirs at Argos, but only a little Disturbance rais'd by a few inconsiderable Persons. But when Megistones, entring Argos, was slain, and the Garrison could scarce hold out, and frequent Messengers came to Cleomenes for Succours, he fearing least the Enemy having taken Argos, should shut up the Passes, and securely waste Laconia, and besiege Sparta it self, which he had left without Forces; he dislodg'd from Corinth, and presently lost that City; for Antigonus entred it, and garrison'd the Town. He turn'd aside from his direct March, and assaulting the Wall of Argos, endeavour'd to break in; and having clear'd a way under the quarter called Aspis, he joyn'd the Garrison which still held out against the Achaeans; some parts of the City he scal'd, and took, and his Cretan Archers clear'd the Streets. But when he saw Antigonus with his Phalanx descending from the Mountains into the Plain, and the Horse on all sides entring the City, he thought it impossible to maintain his Post, and therefore with all his Men made a safe Retreat behind the Wall. Having in a short time rais'd himself to a considerable height, and in one March made himself Master of almost all Peloponnesus, and lost all again in as short a time: For some of his Allies presently forsook him, and others not long after put themselves under Antigonus's Protection. His Army thus defeated, as he was leading back the Relicks of his Forces, some from Lacedaemon met him in the Evening at Tegea, and brought him News of as great a Misfortune as that which he had lately suffer'd, and that was the Death of his Wife, whom he doted on <pb n="16" xml:id="ep000524-015-a"/>so much, that when he was most prosperous, he would ever now and then make a step to Sparta, to visit his beloved Aegiatis. </p>
        <p>This News afflicted him extreamly, and he griev'd, as a young Man would do for the loss of a very beautiful and excellent Wife; yet his Passion did not debase the greatness of his Mind, but keeping his usual Voice, his Countenance, and his Habit, he gave necessary Orders to his Captains, and took care to secure the Tegeans. The next day he retir'd to Sparta, and having at home with his Mother and Children bewail'd the loss, and finish'd his Mourning, he presently appear'd about the publick Affairs of the State. Now Ptolomy, the King of Aegypt, promis'd him Assistance, but demanded his Mother and Children for Hostages: this for some considerable time he was asham'd to discover to his Mother; and though he often went to her on purpose, and was just upon the Discourse, yet still refrain'd, and kept it to himself: so that she began to suspect somewhat, and ask'd his Friends, Whether Cleomenes had somewhat to say to her, which he was afraid to speak? At last Cleomenes venturing to tell her, she laugh'd heartily, and said, <hi>Was this the thing that you had often a mind to tell me, and was afraid? Why do not you put me on Shipboard, and send this Carkase where it may be most serviceable to </hi>Sparta, <hi>before Age wastes it unprofitably here? </hi>Therefore all things being provided for the Voyage, they went to Taenarus on Foot, and the Army waited on them. Cratesiclaea, when she was ready to go on Board, took Cleomenes aside into Neptune's Temple, and embracing him who was very much dejected, and extreamly discompos'd, she said thus, <hi>Go to King of </hi>Sparta; <hi>when we are without door, let none see us Weep, or show any Passion below the Honour and Dignity of </hi>Sparta; <hi>for that alone is in our own Power: as for Success or Disappointments, those wait on us as the Deity decrees. </hi>Having said thus, and compos'd her Countenance, she went to the Ship with her little Grandson, and bad the Pilot put presently out to Sea. When she came to Aegypt, and understood that Ptolomy entertain'd Proposals and Overtures of Peace from Antigonus, and that Cleomenes, tho the Achaeans invited and urg'd him to an Agreement, was afraid, for her sake, to come to any, without Ptolomy's consent, she wrote to him, advising him to do that which was most becoming and most profitable for Sparta, and not for the sake of an old Woman and a little Child, always stand in fear of Ptolomy: this Character she maintain'd in her Misfortunes. Antigonus having taken Tegea, and plunder'd Orchomenum and <hi>Mantinaea, Cleomenes </hi>was shut up within the narrow Bounds of Laconia, and made such of the Heilots as could pay five Attick pounds, <pb n="17" xml:id="ep000524-015-b"/>free of Sparta, and by that means got together 500 Talents; and arming 2000 after the Macedonian fashion, that he might make a Body fit to oppose Antigonus's Lucaspidae (white Shields) he undertook a very considerable and very surprizing Enterprize. Megalopolis was at that time a City of itself, as big and as powerful as Sparta, and had the Forces of the Achaeans and Antigonus encamping on its sides; and it was chiefly the Megalopolitans doing, that Antigonus was call'd in to assist the <hi>Achaeans. Cleomenes </hi>having a design upon this City, (no Action was ever more sudden and more unexpected) order'd his Men to take five days Provision, and so march'd to Sellasia, as if he intended to spoil the Country of the Argives; but from thence making a descent into the Territories of Megalopolis, and refreshing his Army about Rhaetium, he march'd through Helicon, directly to the City. When he was not far off the Town, he sent Panteus with two Regiments to surprize the Mesopyrgion, (the Quarter between the two Towers) which he understood to be the most unguarded Quarter of the Megalopolitans Fortifications; and with the rest of his Forces he follow'd leisurely Panteus, not only surpriz'd that place, but finding a great part of the Wall without Guards, he pull'd down some Places, and demolish'd others, and kill'd all the Defenders that he found. Whilst he was thus busied, Cleomenes came up to him, and was got with his Army within the City, before the Megalopolitans knew of the surprize: At last, as soon as it was discover'd, some left the Town immediately, taking with them what Money they had ready; some arm'd, and engag'd the Enemy; and tho' they were not able to beat them out, yet they gave their Citizens time and opportunity safely to retire: so that there were not above 1000 Persons left in the Town, all the rest flying with their Wives and Children, and escaping to Messena. A great number of those that arm'd and fought the Enemy, were sav'd, and very few taken, amongst whom were Lysandridas and Thearidas, two Men of great Power and Reputation amongst the Magalopolitans; and therefore the Soldiers, as soon as they were taken, brought them to Cleomenes: And Lysandridas, as soon as he saw Cleomenes afar off, cry'd out: <hi>Now King of </hi>Sparta, <hi>'tis in your power by doing a most Kingly and braver Action than you have alredy perform'd, to purchase a considerable Glory. </hi>And Cleomenes <pb n="18" xml:id="ep000524-016-a"/>guessing at his meaning, reply'd, <hi>What do you say </hi>Lysandridas, <hi>sure you will not advise me to restore your City to you again? 'Tis that which I mean</hi>; Lysandridas <hi>reply'd, and I advise you not to ruin so brave a City, but to fill it with faithful and stedfast Friends and Allies, by restoring their Country to the </hi>Megalopolitans, <hi>and being the Saviour of so considerable a People. Cleomenes </hi>paus'd a while, and then said, <hi>'Tis very hard to trust so far in these Matters; but with us let Profit always yield to Glory. </hi>Having said this, he sent the two Men to Messena with a Trumpeter from himself, offering the Megalopolitans their City again, if they would forsake the Achaean Interest, and be on his side. Th&#244; Cleomenes made these kind and obliging Proposals, yet Philopaemen would not suffer them to break their League with the Achaeans; and accusing Cleomenes to the People, as if his design was not to restore the City, but to take the Citizens too, he forc'd Thearidas and Lysandridas to leave Messena. </p>
        <p>This was that Philopaemen, who was afterward Chief of the Achaeans, and a Man of the greatest Reputation amongst the Greeks, as I have made it appear in his own Life. This News coming to Cleomenes, though he had before taken such strict care that the City should not be plunder'd, yet then being in a Fury, and put out of all Patience, he rifled them of all their Coin, Plate and Jewels, and sent their Statues and Pictures unto Sparta; and demolishing a great part of the City, he march'd away for fear of Antigonus and the Achaeans: but they never stirr'd, for they were in Aegium, at a Council of War. There Aratus mounted the Desk, wept a long while, and held his Mantle before his Face; and at last, the company being amaz'd, and commanding him to speak, he said, <hi>Megalopolis is ruin'd by </hi>Cleomenes, The Assembly was presently Dissolv'd; the Achaeans being extremely surpriz'd at the suddeness and greatness of the loss; and Antigonus intending to send speedy succors, when he found his Army to gather very slowly out of their Winter-Quarters, he sent them Orders to continue there still; and he himself march'd to Argos with a considerable Body of Men. The The second Enterprize of Cleomenes seem'd to be carry'd on by extreme Boldness and unaccountable Madness; but yet in Polybius's Opinion, was done upon mature Deliberation and exact Fore-sight: for knowing very well that the Macedonians were <pb n="19" xml:id="ep000524-016-b"/>dispers'd into their Winter-Quarters, and that Antigonus with his Friends and a few Mercenaries about him, winter'd in Argos; upon these Considerations he invaded the Country of the Argives, hoping to shame Antigonus to a Battle upon unequal terms, or else if he did not dare to fight, to bring him into Disrepute with the Achaeans. And this accordingly hapned; for Cleomenes wasting, plundring, and spoiling the whole Countrey, the Argives vex'd at the loss, ran in Troops to the Palace of the King, and clamour'd that he should either fight, or surrender his Command to better and braver Men. But Antigonus, as became an experienc'd Captain, accounting it dishonourable, foolishly to hazard his Army, and quit his Security, and not to be abus'd and rail'd at by the Rabble, would not march out against Cleomenes, but stood fix'd to the Designs which he had laid: Cleomenes in the mean time brought his Army up to the very Walls, and having uncontroul'dly spoil'd the Countrey, and insulted o'er his Enemies, drew off again. A little while after being advertis'd that Antigonus design'd for Tegea, and thence to make an Incursion into Laconia, he hastily march'd with his Army another way, and appear'd early in the morning before Argos, and wasted the Fields about it: the Corn he did not cut down with Reaping-hooks and Scythes, as Men usually do, but beat it down with Staves made like Scymetars, as if with a great deal of Contempt and wanton Scorn he spoil'd the Fields, and wasted the Country in his march; yet when his Soldiers would have set Cyllabris, the School of Exercise on Fire, he hindred the Attempt, reflecting upon serious consideration, that the Outrages committed at Megalopolis, were the effects of his Passion rather than his Wisdom. He pretended to make such little account of, and so much to despise Antigonus, who first retir'd to Argos, and afterward plac'd Garisons on all the Mountains round about, that he sent a Trumpeter to desire the Keys of Heraeum, (Iuno's Temple) that he might sacrifice to the Goddess. Thus with a Scoff and bitter Reflection on Antigonus, and having sacrific'd to the Goddess; under the Walls of the Temple, which was shut, he march'd to Phlius; and from thence driving out those that Garison'd Hologountum, he march'd down to Orchomenum. And these Enterprizes not only encourag'd the <pb n="20" xml:id="ep000524-017-a"/>Citizens, but made him appear to the very Enemies to be an experienc'd Captain, and very worthy of Command: for with the Strength of one City, not only to fight the Power of the Macedonians, and all the Poloponnesians; not only to preserve Laconia from being spoil'd, but to waste the Enemies Country, and to take so many and such considerable Cities, is an Argument of no common Bravery. He that first said, <hi>That Money was the Sinews of Affairs, </hi>seem'd chiefly in that Saying to respect War: And Demades, when the Athenians had voted that a Navy should be made ready, but had no Money, said, <hi>They should make Bread before they thought of Sailing. </hi>And the old Archidamus, in the beginning of the Poloponnesian War, when the Allies desir'd, that each Parties share of Contributions for the War should be determin'd, is reported to have said, <hi>War cannot be kept to a set Diet</hi>: For as well breath'd Wrestlers do in time weary and tire out the most active and most skilful Combitant; so Antigonus coming to the War with a great stock of Wealth, weary'd out Cleomenes, whose Poverty made it difficult for him either to provide Pay for the Mercenaries, or Provisions for the Citizens. For in all other Respects the Time favour'd Cleomenes; for Antigonus's Affairs at home began to be disturb'd: for the Barbarians wasted and over-ran Macedonia whilst he was absent; and at that time a vast Army of the Illyrians came down: to be freed from whose Outrages, the Macedonians sent for Antigonus, and the Letters had almost been brought to him before the Battel was fought; upon the receipt of which he presently dislodg'd, and left the Achaeans Affairs to themselves. But Fortune, that loves to determine the greatest Affairs by a Minute, in this Conjuncture show'd such an exact niceness of Time, that immediately after the Battle in Sellasia was over, and Cleomenes had lost his Army and his City, the Messengers reach'd Antigonus. And this made Cleomenes's Misfortune more to be pitied; for if he had forborn fighting two days longer, there had been no need of hazarding a Battle, since upon the departure of the Macedonians, he might have had what Conditions he pleas'd from the Achaeans. But now (as I hinted before) for want of Money, being necessitated to rely wholly on his Arms, he was forc'd with 20000 (this is Polybius's Account) to engage thirty thousand; and approving himself an excellent Commander in this Difficulty, <pb n="21" xml:id="ep000524-017-b"/>his Citizens showing an extraordinary Courage, and his Mercenaries Bravery enough; he was over-born by the different way of fighting, and the weight of the arm'd Phalanx. Besides, Phylarchus affirms, that the Treachery of some about him was the chief Cause of Cleomene's Ruine. For Antigonus gave Orders, that the Illyrians and Acharnanians should march round by a secret way, and encompass the other Wing which Eucleidas, Cleomenes's Brother Commanded; and then drew out the rest of his Forces to the Battel. And Cleomenes, from a convenient Rising, viewing his Order, and not seeing any of the Illyrians and Acharnanians, began to suspect that Antigonus had sent them upon some such Design; and calling for Damoteles, who was to inspect and to provide against Ambushes, commanded him carefully to look after, and discover the Enemies Designs upon his Rear. </p>
        <p>But Damoteles (for some say Antigonus had brib'd him) telling him that he should not be solicitous about that matter, for all was well enough, but mind, and fight those that met him in the Front. He was satisfied, and advanc'd against Antigonus; and by the vigorous Charge of his Spartans, made the <hi>Macedonian Phalanx </hi>give ground, and press'd upon them with great Advantage about halfe a Mile; but then making a stand, and seeing the danger which the surrounded Wing commanded by his Brother Eucleidas was in, he cry'd out, <hi>Thou art lost, dear Brother, thou art lost, thou brave example to our </hi>Spartan <hi>Youth, and Theme of our Matron's Songs. </hi>
        </p>
        <p>Eucleidas's Wing being thus cut in pieces, and the Conquerors from that part falling upon his Battle, he perceiv'd his Soldiers to be disorder'd, and unable to maintain the Fight, and therefore provided for his own safety. When he came into the City, he advised those Citizens that he met, to receive Antigonus; and as for himself, he said, which should appear most advantageous to Sparta, whether his Life or Death, that he would chuse. Seeing the Women running out to those that fled with him, taking their Arms, and bring Drinking to them, he entred into his own House, and his Servant, which was a Free-born Woman, taken from Megalopolis after his Wife's Death, offering, as she us'd to do, to make necessary Provision for him returning from the Battle; th&#244; he was very thirsty, he refus'd to drink, and th&#244; very weary, to sit down; but Arm'd as he was, he clapt his Arm side-way to a Pillar, and leaning his Forehead upon his Elbow, he rested his Body a little while, and ran over in his Thoughts what course he should take, and then <pb n="22" xml:id="ep000524-018-a"/>with his Friends went presently to Gythium; where finding Ships fitted for the purpose, they embark'd. Antigonus taking the City, Treated the Lacedemonians courteously, and neither affronting, nor ruining the Dignity of Sparta, but permitting them to enjoy their own Laws and Polity, and sacrificing to the Gods, dislodg'd the the third day: for he heard that there was a great War kindled in Macedonia, and that the Country was spoil'd by the Barbarians; besides, he grew sick of a Consumption and continual Defluxion on the Lungs, yet he still kept up that he might return and free his own Country, and fall more Gloriously upon an heap of slaughter'd Barbarians. As Phylarchus says, and 'tis probable, he broke a Vein by shouting in the Battle. In the Plays 'twas said, that after the Victory he cry'd out for Joy, <hi>O fine Day</hi>! and presently bringing up abundance of Blood, fell into a Fever, and dy'd in a short time. And thus much concerning Antigonus. </p>
        <p>Cleomenes sailing from Cytherae, touch'd at another Island call'd Aegyalia, whence, as he was about to depart from Cyrene, one of his Friends, Therycion by name, a Man of an haughty Spirit in all Enterprizes, and high and boasting in his Talk, came privately to him, and said thus; <hi>Sir, Death in Battel, which is the most Glorious, we have let go; though all heard us say, that </hi>Antigonus <hi>should never tread over the King of </hi>Sparta, <hi>unless dead: And now, that which is next in Bravery and Glory, is presented to us. Whither do we madly sail, flying that which is near, and seeking that which is far removed? For if it is not dishonourable for the Race of </hi>Hercules, <hi>to serve the Successors of </hi>Philip and Alexander, <hi>we shall save a long Voyage by delivering our selves up to </hi>Antigonus, <hi>who probably surpasseth </hi>Ptolomy <hi>as much as the </hi>Macedonians <hi>do the </hi>Aegyptians; <hi>but if we think it mean to submit to those whose Arms have conquer'd us, why should we chuse him for our Lord by whom we have not yet been beaten? Is it that instead of one we might appear meaner than two, whilst we fly </hi>Antigonus, <hi>and flatter </hi>Ptolemy? <hi>Or, is it for your Mothers sake that you retreat to </hi>Aegypt? <hi>It will indeed be a very fine, and very desirable sight for her to be shown her Son by </hi>Ptolemy <hi>'s Women, now chang'd from a Prince into an Exile and a Slave. Are we not still Masters of our own Swords? And whilst we have </hi>Laconia <hi>in view, shall we not here free our selves from this disgraceful Misery, and clear our selves to those, who at </hi>Sellasia <hi>dy'd for the Honour and Defence of </hi>Sparta? <hi>Or, shall we sit lazily in </hi>Aegypt <hi>enquiring what News from </hi>Sparta? <hi>and whom </hi>Antigonus <hi>hath been pleas'd to make Governor of </hi>Lacedemon? Thus spoke Therycion; and <pb n="23" xml:id="ep000524-018-b"/>this was Cleomenes's Reply; <hi>By seeking Death, you Coward, the most easie, and most ready Refuge, you fancy that you shall appear couragious and brave, though this Flight is baser than thy former. Better Men than we have given way to their Enemies, having been betray'd by Fortune, or oppress'd by Multitude; but he that sinks under Labour or Afflictions, the Opinions or Reproaches of Men, is overcome by his own Effeminacy and Softness: For a voluntary Death ought not to be chosen as a Relief from Action, but an Exemplary Action it self; and 'tis base either to live or die only to our selves. That Death to which you now invite us, I propos'd only as a Release from our present Miseries, but carries nothing of Bravery or Profit in it. And I think it becomes both me and you not to despair of our Country; but when there are no hopes of that left, those that have an Inclination may quickly die. </hi>To this Therycion return'd no Answer; but as soon as he could get out of Cleomenes's Company, went toward the Shore, and ran himself through. But Cleomenes sailed from Aegialia, landed in Lybia, and being honourably conducted through the King's Country, came to Alexandria. When he was first brought to Ptolomy, no more than common Civilities, and usual Ceremonies were paid him; but when, upon tryal, he found him a Man of deep Sense, and great Reason, and that his plain Laconick way of Conversation carried a free Pleasantness with it, that he did nothing unbecoming the greatness of his Birth, nor bent under Fortune, and appear'd a more faithful Counsellor, than those who made it their business to please and flatter; he was asham'd, and repented that he had neglected so great a Man, and suffer'd Antigonus to get so much Power and Reputation by ruining him. Therefore he heap'd up Honours and Kindnesses on Cleomenes, and gave him Hopes that he would furnish him with an Army and a Navy to recover Greece, and re-instate him in his Throne. Besides, he allow'd him a yearly Pension of four and twenty Tallents; a little part of which Sum supplied his and his Friends thrifty Temperance; and the rest was imploy'd in doing good Offices to, and in relieving the Necessities of those that fled Greece, and retir'd into Aegypt. </p>
        <p>But the elder Ptolomy dying before Cleomenes's Affairs had receiv'd a full Dispatch, and the Successor being a loose, voluptuous and effeminate Prince, under the power of his Pleasures and his Women, his Business was neglected: for the King was so besotted with his Women and his Wine, that Balls, Musick and Dancing, were the only Employments of his most busie and serious <pb n="24" xml:id="ep000524-019-a"/>hours, and the greatest Affairs of State were manag'd by Agathoclea the King's Mistress, her Mother, and the Pimp Oinanthes. Therefore at the first they seem'd to stand in need of Cleomenes; for Ptolemy being afraid of his Brother Magas, who by his Mother's means had a great Interest among the Soldiers, took Cleomenes into his Cabinet-Council, and acquainted him with the Design of taking off his Brother. He, though all were for it, declar'd his opinion to the contrary, saying, <hi>The King, if it were possible, should have more Brothers for the better security and management of his Affairs: </hi>And Sosibius, the greatest Favourite, replying, <hi>That they were not secure of the Mercenaries whilst </hi>Magas <hi>was alive? Cleomenes </hi>return'd, <hi>That he need not trouble himself about that Matter; for amongst the Mercenaries there were above </hi>3000 Pelopponesians, <hi>who were his fast Friends, and whom he could command at any time with his Nod. </hi>This Discourse made Cleomenes for the present to be look'd upon as a Man of Integrity and Power; but afterwards (Ptolomy's Weakness increasing his Fear, and, as it usually happens, where there is no Judgment and Wisdom at the bottom, placing his Security in Jealousie and Suspicion) rendred Cleomenes suspected to the Courtiers, as having too much Interest with the Mercenaries; and many had this Saying in their Mouths, <hi>That he was a Lion midst a flock of Sheep</hi>: for such he seem'd to be in the Court, slyly overlooking and taking notice of the management of Affairs; therefore when he desir'd a Navy and an Army from the King, his Petition was rejected. But when he understood that Antigonus was dead, that the Achaians were engag'd in a War with the Aetolians, and that the Affairs of Pelopponnesus, being now in very great Distraction and Distress, requir'd and invited his Assistance, he desir'd leave to depart only with his Friends, but could not obtain that, the King not so much as hearing his Petition, being shut up amongst his Women, and wasting his Hours in Debauchery and Frolicks. But Sosibius, the chief Minister of State, thought that Cleomones being detain'd against his will, would grow ungovernable and dangerous, and yet that it was not safe to let him go, being an aspiring, daring Man, and well acquainted with the Diseases and Weakness of the Kingdom; for no Presents, no Gifts, could win him to a Complyance. But as the Ox Apis, though revelling in all possible plenty and delight, yet desires to live as nature would provide for him, to be at liberty, and frisk about the Fields, and can scarce endure to be uuder the Priests keeping; so he could not brook their Courtship, and tender Entertainment, but like Achilles, <q>
            <pb n="25" xml:id="ep000524-019-b"/>
            <l>Whilst there, his heart did waste with secret grief, </l>
            <l>And he was eager for the noisy Wars. </l>
          </q>
        </p>
        <p>His Affairs standing in this condition, Nicagoras the Messenian came to Alexandria, a Man that deeply hated Cleomenes, yet pretended to be his Friend; for he had formerly sold Cleomenes a fair Estate, but never receiv'd the Money, because Cleomenes was either unable, (as it may be) or else, by reason of his engagement in the Wars and other Distractions, had no time to pay him. Cleomenes seeing him landing, (for he was then walking upon the Key) kindly saluted him, and ask'd, <hi>What Business brought to </hi>Aegypt? Nicagoras return'd his Compliment, and told him, <hi>That he came to bring some excellent War-horses to the King. </hi>And Cleomenes with a Smile subjoyn'd, <hi>I wish you had rather brought Pimps, Whores, and Pathicks; for those now are the King's chief Delight. Nicagoras </hi>at the present smil'd at the Conceit; but a few days after he put Cleomenes in mind of the Estate that he had bought of him, and desir'd his Money, protesting that he would not have trouble him, if his Merchandize had turned to that Account, which he thought it would. Cleomenes reyly'd, That he had not a penny left of all that had been given him: At which Answer Nicagoras being nettled, told Sosibius Cleomenes's Scoff upon the King. He caress'd him for the Discovery, but desiring to have some greater Reason to excite the King against Cleomenes, persuaded Nicagoras to leave a Letter written against Cleomenes, importing that he had a Design, if he could have gotten Ships and Soldiers, to surprize <hi>Cyrene: Nicagoras </hi>wrote such a Letter, and left Aegypt. Four days after Sosibius brought the Letter to Ptolomy, pretending it was just then deliver'd him, and with a bitter Invective excited the Fury of the Youth; upon this it was agreed, that Cleomenes should be invited into a large Apartment, and treated as formerly, but not suffer'd to go out again: this Usage was grievous to Cleomenes, and by this unlucky Accident, his Hopes for the future seem'd to be quite dash'd. Ptolomy, the Son of Chrysermas, a Favourite of the Kings, always carried himself fairly towards Cleomenes; they contracted a near Acquaintance, and would talk freely together about the State. He upon Cleomenes's Desire came to him, had some Discourse with him, upon a few and inconsiderable Subjects, to avoid suspicion, and made some Excuses for the King; but as he went out again, not knowing that Cleomenes follow'd him to the Door, he very severely <pb n="26" xml:id="ep000524-020-a"/>reprimanded the Keepers, for their Carelessness in looking after so great and so furious a wild Beast. This Cleomenes himself heard, and retiring before Ptolomy perceiv'd it, told his Friends what he had heard. Upon this they cast off all their former Hopes, and determin'd for violent Proceedings, resolving to be reveng'd on Ptolomy for his base and unjust Dealing, to have satisfaction for the Affronts, to die as it became Spartans, and not stay till, like fatted Sacrifices, they were Butcher'd: for 'twas both grievous and dishonourable for Cleomenes, who had scorn'd to come to Terms with Antigonus, a brave Warrior, and a Man of Action, to wait an effeminate King's leisure, till he should lay aside his Fiddle, and end his Dance, and then kill him. These Courses being resolv'd on, and Ptolomy hapning at the same time to make a Progress to Canopus, they first spread abroad a Report, that his Freedom was order'd by the King; and it being the King's custom, to send Presents and an Entertainment to those whom he would free, Cleomenes Friends made that Provision, and sent it into the Prison, thereby deceiving the Keepers, who thought it had been sent by the King; for he sacrific'd, and gave them large Pottions, and with a Crown upon his Head feasted and made merry with his Friends: 'tis said, that he began the Action sooner than he design'd, having understood that a Servant of one of the Accomplices lay abroad with a Mistress that he lov'd. This made him afraid of a Discovery; and therefore as soon as it was full Noon, and all the Keepers drunk and fast asleep, he put on his Coat, and opening the Seam on his right Shoulder, with his drawn Sword in his hand he issued forth, together with his Friends, provided in the same manner, making 13 in all. One of them, by Name Hippotas, was lame, he follow'd the first Onset very well; but when afterward he perceiv'd that they were more slow in their Advances for his sake, he desir'd them to run him through, and not ruine their Enterprize, by staying for an useless, unprofitable Man. By chance an Alexandrian was then riding by the Door, him they threw off, and setting Hippotas on Horseback, ran through the narrow Lanes, and proclaim'd Liberty to the People; but they, it seems, had Courage enough to praise and admire Cleomenes's Daring, but not one had the heart to follow and assist him. Three of them fell on Ptolomy, the Son of Chrysermas, as he was coming out of the Palace, and kill'd him: Another Ptolomy, the Lieutenant of the City, advancing against them in a Chariot, they set <pb n="27" xml:id="ep000524-020-b"/>upon, dispers'd his Guards and Attendants, and pulling him out of the Chariot, kill'd him upon the place. Then they made toward the Castle, designing to break open the Prison, and take the Prisoners to their Assistance; but the Keepers were too quick for them, and secur'd the Passages. Being baffled in this attempt, Cleomenes with his Company roam'd about the City, none joyning with him, but all retreating from, and flying his approach: therefore despairing of Success, and saying to his Friends, That it was no wonder that Women rul'd o'er those Men that fled Liberty, he excited them all to dye as bravely as became his Followers, and Men of their Glorious performances. This said, Hippotas was first, as he desir'd, run through by one of the young Men, and then each of them readily and resolutely fell upon his own Sword, except Panteus, that Panteus that first surpriz'd Megalopolis. This Man being a very handsom Person, and a better Companion than any of the Youth, the King lov'd, and bade him, when he had seen him and the rest fall'n, dye, by their Example. Panteus walk'd over them as they lay, and prick'd every one with his Dagger, to try whether any was alive; when he prick'd Cleomenes in the Leg, and saw him turn upon his Back, he kiss'd him, sate down by him, and when he was quite dead, cover'd his Carkass, and then kill'd himself upon his Body. </p>
        <p>Thus fell Cleomenes,, that great, brave Man, after he had been king of Sparta sixteen Years. The news of their Fall being nois'd through the City, Cratesilaea, though a Woman of a great Spirit, could not bear up against the insupportable weight of this Affliction; but embracing Cleomenes's Children, made grievous Lamentations; but the eldest Boy, none suspecting such a Spirit in a Child, threw himself headlong from the top of the House; he was bruis'd very much, but not kill'd by the Fall, and was taken up crying, and expressing his Resentments for not being permitted to destroy himself. Ptolomy, as soon as an account of the Action was brought him, gave order that Cleomenes's Body should be Flea'd and hung up; that his Children, Mother, and the Women that were with her, should be kill'd. Amongst those was Panteus's Wife, a very fair Woman, and of a stately Carriage, who had been but newly Married, and suffer'd these disasters in the height of her Love. Her Parents would not let her embark with Panteus presently after they were Married, though she eagerly desir'd it, <pb n="28" xml:id="ep000524-021-a"/>but shut her up, and kept her by violence at home; yet a few days after she got a Horse and a little Money, and escaping by Night, made speed to Taenarus, where she embark'd for Aegypt, came to her Husband, and with him cheerfully endur'd to live in a Foreign Country. She led Cratesiclaea as she was going with the Soldiers to Execution, help up her Train, and begg'd her to be courageous, who of her self was not in the least afraid of Death, and desir'd nothing else, but only to be kill'd before the Children. When they were come to the place of Execution, the Children were first kill'd before Cratesiclaea's Eyes, and afterward she her self, with only these words in her Mouth; <hi>O Children, whither are you gone? </hi>But Pantaeus's Wife girding her Garments close to her, and being a strong Woman, without any Noise or Lamentation, lookt after every one that was slain, and wound them up as well as her present Circumstances would permit; and after all, were kill'd, dressing her self, bound her Cloaths close about her, and suffering none to come near, or be an Eye-witness of her Fall, beside the Executioner, she courageously submitted to the stroak, and wanted no body to look after her, or wind her up after she was dead. Thus in her Death the Modesty of her Mind appear'd, and set the Guard upon her Body, which she always kept when alive: And she in the declining Age of the Spartans shew'd, That Women were no unequal Rivals of the Men, and was an Instance of such a Courage as would not sneak to the Affronts of Fortune. A few days after, those that watch'd the hanging Body of Cleomenes, saw a very great Snake winding about his Head, and covering his Face, so that no Bird of Prey should fly at it. This made the King superstitiously afraid, and set the Women upon several Lustrations, as if he had been an extraordinary Man, and one belov'd by the Gods that had been slain. And the Alexandrians made Processions to the Place, and gave Cleomenes the Title of Heroe, and Son of the Gods, till the Philosophers satisfied them, by saying, That, <hi>as Oxen breed Bees, putrifying Horses breed Hornets, and Beetles rise from the Carkasses of dead Asses, so the Humours and Iuices of the Marrow of a Man's Body coagulating, produce Serpents. </hi>And this the Ancients observing, appropriated a Serpent rather than any other Creature to Heroe's. </p>
