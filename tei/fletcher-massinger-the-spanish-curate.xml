        <l>The Name ye know, that's nothing to my Story; </l>
        <l>To tell ye, 'tis familiar, void of Glory; </l>
        <l>Of State, of Bitternesse: of wit you'll say, </l>

        <l>The Streame that guides ye, easie to attend: </l>

        <l>To assure you any thing, unlesse you see, </l>
        <l>And so conceive, is vanity in me; </l>
        <l>Therefore I leave it to it selfe, and pray </l>
        <l>Like a good Barke, it may worke out to day, </l>
        <l>And stem all doubts; 'twas built for such a proofe, </l>
        <l>And we hope highly: if she lye aloofe </l>
        <l>For her owne vantage, to give wind at will, </l>
        <l>Why let her worke, onely be you but still, </l>
        <l>And sweet opinion'd, and we are bound to say, </l>
        <l>You are worthy Judges, and you crowne the Play. </l>
