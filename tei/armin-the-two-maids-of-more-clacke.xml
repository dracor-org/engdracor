        <p>GENTLEMEN, Cittizens, Rustickes, or quis non, I haue boldly put into your hands, a Historical discourse, acted by the boyes of the Reuels, which perchaunce in part was sometime acted more naturally in the Citty, if not in the hole. Howsoeuer I commit it into your hands to be scan'd, and you shall find verse, as well blancke, as crancke, yet in the prose let it passe for currant, I would haue againe inacted Iohn my selfe, but Tempora mutantur in illis, &amp; I cannot do as I would, I haue therefore thought good to diuulge him thus being my old acquaintance, lack, whose life I knew, and whose remembrance I presume by appearance likely. Wherein I whilome pleased: and being requested both of Court and Citty, to shew him in priuate, I haue therefore printed him in publike, wishing thus much to euery one, so delighting, I might put life into this picture, and naturally act him to your better contents; but since it may not be, my entreaty is, that you would accept this dumbe show, and be well wishing to the substance. </p>
