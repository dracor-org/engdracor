        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context
     and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B'
     represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6
     of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed
     by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an
     unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span
     of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
