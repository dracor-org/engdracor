        <p>CVrteous Reader (for so I presume thou art) if otherwise, thou losest the title of being stiled ingenious; for there are none but favour learning, if they so much as pretend to it: but I hope I neede make no apologie, either to gaine thy fauour, or to credit the Worke, it has so often pass'd with approbation, that I have hopes it will continue it. If there be any so supercilious to condemne it, before they read it, let them rest content with the title, and not enter into the Theater, unlesse they intend to behold the Florales. However, my Muse has descended to this subiect; let men esteeme of her, onely as a reprover, not an interpreter of wickednesse: Occultare peccantis, promulgare ludentis est. </p>
        <p>Aristippus being compelled to dance in purple <pb xml:id="ep000154-003-a"/>against the dignity of a Phylosopher, made an excuse, that the baits of sinne had no power on a good nature: and Plato having compos'd wanton Verses, affirmed, that the more plaine they were, the more honest: and your former Writers, in their accurate discovery of vice, have mingled the precepts of wisdome. If thou shalt accept this as it was simply meant, the applause it has obtain'd, shall not so much crowne it as thy acceptation. </p>

              <p>NOble sir, I am sorry to interest my unstaynd honour in the patronage of offendors, or to abuse the credit I haue with you, in stopping the course of Iustice against them, whose youthfull licenciousnesse, would pollute the pen of a Lady to excuse it. On the other part, J hold it the betraying of a virgins sweete disposition, to withdraw her fauours, where she has once plac'd them, although there be some want of desert. I must confesse tis an Antipathy to my nature, to see any Gentleman suffer, when I may preuent it. Howsoeuer I haue found a disrespect from him, yet I forget it. For anger abides in the bosomes of women, as snow on the ground: where it is smooth and leuell, it fals quickly off, but remaynes where it is rough and vneuen. That this may appeare to bee true, I would intreate you to dismisse those two Gentlemen and their associates, Mr. Trimalchio, and Capritio, whose ryotous loosenesse has made them obnoxious to your censure, and my suspicion. Thus <pb xml:id="ep000154-036-a"/>not doubting the successe of my letter, I rest in your fauour as you may presume on mine, and your true friend, </p>
