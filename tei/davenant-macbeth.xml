        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>DUncan, King of the Scots, had two Principal Men, whom he Imployed in all Matters of Importance, Macbeth and Banquo, These two Traveling together through a Forrest, were met by three Fairie Witches (Weirds the Scots call them) whereof the first making Obeysance unto Macbeth, saluted him, Thane (a Title unto which that of Earl afterwards succeeded) of Glammis, the second Thane of Cowder, and the third King of Scotland: This is unequal dealing, saith Banquo, to give my Friend all the Honours, and none unto me: To which one of the Weirds made Answer, That he indeed should not be a King, but out of his Loyns should come a Race of Kings; that should for ever Rule the Scots. And having thus said, they all suddenly Vanished, Vpon' their Arrival at the Court, Macbeth was immediately Created Thane of Glammis; and not long after some new Service of his, requiring new Recompence, he was Honoured with Title of Thane of Cowder. Seeing then how happily the Prediction of the three Weirds fell out, in the former he Resolved not to be wanting to himself in fulfilling the third; and therefore first he Killed the King, and after by reason of his Command among the Souldiers and Common People, he Succeeded in his Throne. Being scarce warm in his Seat, he called to mind the Prediction given to his Companion Banquo: Whom hereupon suspected as his Supplanter, he caused to be Killed, together with his Posterity: Flean one of his Sons, Escaped only, with no small difficulty into Wales, Freed as he thought from all fear of Banquo and his Issue; he Built Dunsinan Castle, and made it his Ordinary Seat: And afterwards on some new Fears, Consulted with certain of his Wizards about his future Estate: Was told by one of them, that he should never be Overcome, till Birnam Wood (being some Miles distant) came to Dunsinan Castle; and by another, that he should never be Slain by any Man which was Born of a Woman. Secure then as he thought, from all future Dangers; he omitted no kind of Libidinous Cruelty for the space of 18 Years; for so long he Tyrannized over Scotland. But having then made up the Measure of his Iniquities, Macduff the Governor of Fife, associating to himself some few Patriots (and being assisted with Ten Thousand English) equally hated by the Tyrant, and abhorring the Tyranny, met in Birnam Wood, taking every one of them a Bough in his hand (the better to keep them from discovery) Marching early in the Morning towards Dunsinan Castle, which they took by <hi>Scalado. Macbeth </hi>escaping, was pursued by Macduff, who having overtaken him, urged him to the Combat; to whom the Tyrant, half in scorn, returned this Answer: That he did in Vain attempt to Kill him, it being his Destiny never to be Slain by any that was Born of Woman. Now then said Macduff, is thy fatal end drawing fast upon thee, for I was never Born of Woman, but violently Cut out of my Mothers Belly: Which words so daunted the cruel Tyrant, though otherways a Valiant man and of great Performances, that he was very easily slain; and <hi>Malcolm Conmer</hi>, the true Heir, Seated in his Throne. </p>
