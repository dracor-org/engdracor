        <p>WHo are to understand that the intent of our Author in the Originall, was no wayes to traduce the Reverend Authority of the <hi>English Laws</hi>, nor any of the Honourable, or other subordinate professors of them, but only to reflect on those persons who being possessed with as much Impudence as Ignorance, doe pretend to the highest knowledge of the Laws, when indeed they deserve not the appellation of Apprentices therein. </p>
        <p>If the Latine tongue were ever the Language of the Beast, it is in the Mouths of these persons. In the English Translation we have all along inserted the Latine Barbarismes, not only to render these Soloecismes to be the more abandoned and ridiculous, but withall to satisfie the method of Ingenuity, which is to give Light as well as Delight unto her Readers. </p>

My master saith also that he hath three Benefices that heretofore he hath given gratis to these predicables (wich nevertheless I do not believe) but he saith that they who shall have them hereafter shall pay soundly for them, <hi>pro toto &amp; in solido</hi>. He alleageth moreover that there is one Jeofail in the play to make a common Lawyer, a common Fool, who useth to make of other men common Fools. And another Jeofail that they made him speak Latine in Burdeaux which he cannot do either here, or there; but if they Act again that prohibited play we will make most gallant Ballads of them, and better then those that have been already made, although they are superfine and stand with us in the case against Cambridge, neverthelesse many say that they are but foolish Libells and therefore most worthily condemned for heretical in the late convocation house at Oxford.

            <p>This London Merchant forbearing his bonds the payment, I repaired to London to demand my Mony, where being fed &amp; flatterd with delays I grew familiarly acquainted with a widow of my own Country, whose name is Dorothy; she then did live in London, and was there Married to a rich Knight and Alderman of that City, whose name was Mally, no, it was Manley. He not long after his Marriage did take her with him to his own habitation in London, and falling into an irrecoverable sicknesse he made her sole Executress, &amp; departed this world. He had no children by her, but two by a former Wife, and both of them of an extraordinary beauty, the eldest Daughters name was Katharine, and the youngest Isabell. These two, with a considerable Dowry for them, he on his Death bed left to the care and charge of Dorothy (although their step-mother) who was to provide them Husbands when they arrived to the years of Marriage; they did exceed in Wealth but excelled more in Vertue and in Beauty, what shall I say, I loved the Widow well, I loved her intirely, a long time I courted <pb rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000695-010-b"/>her, a long time she denied me, at the last I obtain'd her good will &amp; married her: the year being almost expired she was delivered at one Birth, of two children: you Anthonio are one of them, &amp; Anthonine the other, and both so like, that one could not be known from the other, neither I, nor your Mother could distinguish betwixt you, were it not for a little Mole which Anthonine had in his right Cheek. Six years afterwards returning hither into my own Countrey I took you along with me, and left Anthonine with his Mother at London. Since that time full fifteen years are expired; for as we travelled hither through France, the War being very hot betwixt the French and English, we were taken by the Enemy, and but six months are passed since a peace being on both sides concluded we were permitted to have our liberty; no sooner was I a free Man, but every day I resolved with my self to go to London to see my Dorothy, but being detained by wrangling suits of Law, I remain here still whether I will or not, and am still here likely to remain, O the Lernaean Race of bold Pragmatick men who immortaly do sow divisions amongst mortality, and perpetually make one suit to beget another. Wherefore fly suits at Law, a lean Arbitration is better then a fat Judgement. Remember what I speak unto you. </p>

            <p>ANtonio complains of his misfortune, and realates his love, and his courting of Rosabella the daughter of a Noble man of Portugall, who dying at Fess, did commit her to the trust of his brother <hi>Roderigo Torcol</hi>, who exercising the trade of a Pandar at Burdeaux, would not sell her under six hundred Crowns, which Ignoramus the Lawyer residing then at Burdeaux, for the composing of Differences and suits at law, did bargain to give unto him; Neverthelesse Antonio doth rejoice that he and his love have already plighted their troths to one another. </p>
            <stage xml:id="ep000695-e10830">Antonio alone. </stage>
            <p>What but two hours! must I live but two hours longer? woe is me; If I go without thee Rozabella, I go without my life; my Father neverthelesse commands me to be gone; Him I must obey; but love doth enforce me to stay whether I will or not; what shall I doe? whether I go or stay I am undone; I must obey my Father, This only doth remain to give him the last Farewel before I go hence and die; for that my hopes are quite lost, the bare Disposition of the most impure Portugall, Uncle to my Love and who now liveth with him, doth prompt me to believe. He pretends himself to be a Merchant but is indeed no more then a Bawd; his name is Torcol so called from his wry &amp; distorted neck &amp; maners: did you but see him you would say you never saw an uglier Bulk of sin; but be he never so deformed, he as yet gives an honest &amp; a civil entertainment to my Love, and will dispose of her in marriage, as becometh his Brothers Daughter; for a noble Portugall the Father of Rozabella dying at Fess (to which place the rougher hand of war and conquest brought him) left his Daughter as a Ward to his tuition being his brother, and then at Fess: she being now the most beautiful of her sex is courted by many who would be proudl● glad to marry her, though without a portion: But the greedy and covetous Pandar will have money for her; I therefore who would morgage my life to have her have contracted with him to make her my wife for six hundred Crowns. <pb rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000695-012-b"/>The bargain was struck but on this condition to pay him the mony within the space of a month. I have ever since made it my business to procure it but could not effect it; He therefore takes me to be unable, and himself deluded, and is making a new Market with an English Lawyer, who being sent for from thence with many others of his Nation and Profession to compose some differences between some of their own Nation here at Burdeaux, hath that leisure forsooth to fall in Love, and indeed is inflamed to a madnesse with the beauties of my Mistresse; Instead of Latin he speaks nothing but Barbarismes, A meer Kickshaw, and an Asse laden with Gold; and to be a short a Lawyer. But this doth much rejoice me that our Hands and Hearts are linked, unknown to him, unknown to my own Father from whom I carefully do conceal it. But whiles I am speaking my hour is slipt from me, a poor horarious man. I will make hast unto her, but who is this? Ignoramus the Lawyer; This is He who would take my Love from me, but I may chance meet with him. </p>

As our ship therefore did ride on the River of Thames not farre from Detford, the Nurse of Rosabella (carrying her in her Arms) walked along the banks side, Vrtado by chance was there in a boat, and expressing himself in English to the Nurse in as fair and as flattering words as possibly he could, he so far prevailed that he inticed the Nurse, with her pretty burden in her Arms, to come into his ship, which the easie and foolish Woman did accordingly; she was no sooner in the ship but immediately he Hoysed sayles, and brought her into Mauritania with other English Children, where for a round sum of Money he sold this young Lady, and me with her, at Fesse to Alphonsus, who having no Children of his own did adopt her being about Four Years of Age for his own daughter, and laid a great charge on me, being then his servant, not to reveal it unto any, I therefore did conceale it, and this is the first time I have seen her since the death of my master Alphonsus. </p>
