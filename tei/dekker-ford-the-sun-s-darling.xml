                  <p>Generally believed to have been originally written by Dekker, perhaps his unpublished "Phaeton," revised, with additions, by Ford, to whom the last two acts may be assigned. Cf. Camb. History of Eng. lit.; DNB.</p>

                  <p>According to Greg's List of plays (p. 38) and the collation in the Catalogue of the library of F. Locker-Lampson (p. 45) the dedication differs from that in the edition of 1657, but that given in Pearson's reprint, 1873, is the same as that in the L.C. copy of 1657: "To the Right Honorable Thomas Wriathesley, Earle of Southampton." The Locker-Lampson copy contains a dedication to "Algernowne Percy, Earl of Northumberland."</p>

While the Stage florisht, the POEM liv'd by the breath of Generall Applauses, and the Virtuall Fervor of the Court; But since hath languisht <pb xml:id="ep000569-003-a"/>for want of heate, and now neere shrunk up with Cold, creepes (with a shivering feare) to Extend it selse at the Flames of your Benignity. My Lord, though it seems Rough and Forlorn, It is the issu of Worthy parents, and we doubt not, but you will find it accomplisht with their Vertue. Be pleased then (my Lord) to give it entertainement, the more Destitute and needy it is, the Greater Reward may be challenged by your Charity; and so being shelt'rd under your Wings, and Comforted by the Sun-shine of your Favoure, it will become Proofe against the Injustice of Time, and like one of Demetrius statues appeare fresher and fresher to all Ages. My Lord, were we not Confident of the Excellence of the Peece, wee should not dare to Assume an impudence to preferr it to a Person of your HONOR, and KNOWN JUDGMENT; whose HEARTS are ready SACRIFICES, to your NAME and HONOR, Being my Lorde </p>
