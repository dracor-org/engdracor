        <head>TO THE HONOURABLE Sir John Walter, Bar. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>UNder the present <hi>License of the Press</hi>, and <hi>Freedom of Religion</hi>, Two very fair Establish'd English Liberties; methinks I have the Umbrage even of a Law on my side, to Authorize my Presumption, in paying this publick Devotion, to so Worthy a Patron; and fixing so fair a Name, in the Frontispiece of so poor a Trifle. </p>
        <p>You must pardon me, Sir, if I lay hold of all occasions, and every Argument to warrant my Ambition: Besides, I have a stronger Charter than Poetick Priviledge, 'tis my Gratitude that dictates to my Pen; You have already vouchsaf'd to Honour me with your Smiles, (and where such Goodness descends, 'tis natural for our Pride to aspire) whil'st warm'd and animated by that only Encouragement, I am embolden'd to make you this Dedication; insomuch that my present Devoirs have more of the Thanksgiving, than the Prayer; a Duteous Acknowledgment for Blessings already received. And here I must avow to the World, That in Addressing to a person Enrich'd with so many Generous Accomplishments, I▪ set not out a Discoverer, a Columbus to any unknown Golden Coast: No, Sir, Your <pb xml:id="ep000591-003-a"/>past Favours have swell'd my Sails, whil'st I am carried by a fair Levant to an open free Port, and a Hospitable Shoar. </p>
        <p>That Sweetness of Temper runs through all Your Conversation, so free from any Allay of Pride, (that too common Taint of Prosperity,) that You have all the Sweets of the Rose, without the prickles. Your Goodness so Frank, and so diffusive, and the Access to it so Easie, that those who have the more particular happiness of Your nearest Intimacay, and Friendship, find those Charms in Your Conversation, that they are scarce (pardon the seeming Contradiction,) to be enjoy'd: For the more they are possest, the more they are desir'd. </p>
        <p>HONOUR, and GALLANTRY are not only Born, but bred up with You. You Challenge not only all the Advantages of a Fair and Generous Birth, but You have all the Improvements of a Generous and Sprightly Genius too, with so forward, so hopeful, and so growing a Merit (that ample Addition to your Hereditary Desert) that the Stem is a Grace to the Root. </p>
        <p>If Providence does ever Study for her Fair Creations, she Thinks when she makes a Compleat Gentleman. And Fortune in the Donations of her Golden Favours upon You, has not Showr'd them at Random; she found that WORTH, that challeng'd her Smiles, and her Graces are not her Gift, but her Reward. </p>
        <p>But to all Your other Felicities there's the chief one yet wanting, to compleat the Summ; the Charms of LOVE, that double Heaven of Joy, where You must give Blessings when You receive them. And here I must beg your leave, to wish You that truly fair and Virtuous Choice, That like the Famous Youth of Troy, You may have Rival Beauties all waiting when your kind Hand shall give the Prize, and bestow the Ball of Gold. And truly, the Generous and the Brave shou'd ever make Love, <pb xml:id="ep000591-003-b"/>their nearest Care. For indeed, Love is the only Foundation of Immortality. For though Noble Virtues, a Sweet Fame, and Fragrant Memory may keep a fair Name alive; yet to make Your self live for Ever, You only want a Lovely Feminine Partner, to draw Living Copies from so Excellent an Original. </p>
        <p>But I must not dwell too long upon this Subject, For as Dedications are by Custom, only the Panegyricks upon the Patron's Virtues, possibly to so much Modesty, (one of your most shining Perfections,) I may make but ungrateful Musick on that Theme. Yet why shou'd WORTH and HONOUR any more Blush to hear their own just Praises, then the Hero, or Monarch his Triumph, or Coronation Song. The Theme on this side may be as Copious, and as inspiring as that; Desert and Applause are not confin'd only to Palaces and Thrones; the Chapplet sometimes may Sparkle, as well as the Diadem. 'Tis true the Encomiums of Extraordinary Desert; are what my poorest of Quills shou'd not presume to attempt, as being a Province for the Elder Sons of Apollo; and yet when I consider, that the Ayres that are tuned but to an Oaten Pipe, may be as chearfully and heartily Sung, though not so sweetly and loud as to a Silver Trumpet; I have that only Plea for this Boldness, which gives me the Honour of Subscribing my self, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE: </head>
        <byline>Spoke by Mr. THURMOND. </byline>
        <l>THREE Ways there are, and all accounted fair, </l>
        <l>To gain your Favour: Begging, Borrowing, Prayer. </l>
        <l>If as a Beggar, I your Alms implore </l>
        <l>Methinks your Charity shou'd aid the Poor; </l>
        <l>Besides, I never beg'd of you before. </l>
        <l>If I address by Prayer, and loud Complaints </l>
        <l>I then oblige yee, for I make you Saints; </l>
        <l>And sure none here can think it Superstition, </l>
        <l>To pray to Saints that are of no Religion! </l>
        <l>If Invocation will not do my Work, </l>
        <l>A Man may borrow of a Jew or Turk; </l>
        <l>Pray lend me Gentlemen your Applause and Praise, </l>
        <l>I'll take it for as good as Currant Bays; </l>
        <l>And if I ne're repay it, 'tis no more, </l>
        <l>Than many of you Sparks have done before: </l>
        <l>With this distinction, that you ran indebt </l>
        <l>For want of Money, we for want of Wit. </l>
        <l>In vain I plead! a Man as soon may get </l>
        <l>Mill'd Silver, as one favour from the Pit. </l>
        <l>— Hold then— now I think on't, </l>
        <l>I'll e'en turn Thief, and steal your kind Affection, </l>
        <l>And when I've got your Hearts, claim your protection: </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000591-004-a"/>
        <l>You can't Gazette me sure for such a crime, </l>
        <l>Since neither Mare nor Lap-dog, I purloin: </l>
        <l>While you Rob Ladies Bosoms every day, </l>
        <l>And filch their pretious Maiden-heads away; </l>

        <l>But in your humours let's ye all alone, </l>
        <l>And not so much as Fools themselves runs down. </l>
        <l>Our Author try'd his best, and Wisemen tell, </l>

        <l>What tho' his poor Allay runs not so fine; </l>

        <l>For wanting fairer Ore, and riches mould </l>
        <l>He stamps in Brass, what others print in Gold: </l>
        <l>Smile on him but this time, the next perhaps, </l>
        <l>If he guess right he may deserve your Claps. </l>

Trust a Woman, and with a Matter of such Importance, what a simple Dog am I?

              <p>Madam, you may command me— Not to molest the Company with the Recital of every vain and needless Circumstance; 'twas briefly thus. Scarce had we passed by Marget on our Course, when on a sudden, from the Top-mast head, a Sailer cries, All hands Aloft, three Sails ahead: With that we rumidg and clear our Deck, our Gun-room arm'd, and all things now are ready for a Fight. The Ships before descried, with warlike Stems cut the resisting Waves, whilst from their Pendants fluttering in the Air, we found they were three Dunkirk Privateers; they having made our English Cross advanced, salute us with a Broad-side, to make us strike and yield: But we, who ne're knew as yet what 'twas so cowardly to yield, and not regarding their unequal Odds, fell boldly on, returning Fire for Fire. The Engagement then grew desperate, for they on either Side fired in amain, whilst we withstood their Force. At length they boldly grappled, and laid us close aboard, and we as bravely beat them off again. </p>

        <lg>
          <l>YOV met with good Intention to be witty, </l>
          <l>And rally the Grave Cuckolds of the City; </l>
          <l>But disappointed of your Recreation, </l>
          <l>I in your Looks can read the Play's Damnation. </l>
          <l>Lord! how ye stare to find an honest Bride, </l>
          <l>A thing you think a Monster in Cheapside. </l>
          <l>Whither you boast that you so often come, </l>
          <l>And leave your Footmen to perform at home. </l>
          <l>Yet 'tis no little Comfort t' us howe're, </l>
          <l>You oftner bring th' Estate than get the Heir. </l>
          <l>Vnjustly therefore you your Fortune blame, </l>

          <l>I hear a Beau cry, 'tis some damn'd Mistaker; </l>
          <l>A Cheap-side Vertue, City-Cuckold maker. </l>
          <l>This is a Fault no Gentleman can pardon, </l>
          <l>It gives Cheapside the Sins of Covent-Garden: </l>
          <l>We must refine on Vice, and take new Measures, </l>

          <l>Or Locket's Revels may revenge Pontack's: </l>
          <l>This Cuckolding to you's a losing Trade, </l>
          <l>That pay for making, and for being made. </l>
          <l>The Ladies will my Character excuse, </l>
