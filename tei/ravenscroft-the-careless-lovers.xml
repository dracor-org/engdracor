        <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER. </head>
        <p>EPistles Dedicatory, and long Prefaces are of late much in Request; no Person of Quality, how remote soever, can escape the Impertinences of Poets; for though they be Hundreds of Miles off, they shall be pursu'd, and persecuted with Dedicatories o're and o're, even by the same Authors: which is a scurvy Compliment, like that of desiring a Man to be God-Father to every Child that is Born, though their Neighbours perhaps Club'd to the getting them; These Troubles, liberal Patrons, and kind God-Fathers, draw on themselves: But this is excusable in them that Write for Bread, and Live by Dedications, and Third-Dayes. If once in a Year they meet not with a good Audience, or a Bountiful Moecenas, we are to expect no Play from them the next; because they want Money to keep the great Wits company; from whose Conversation, once in Twelve Months, they pick up a Comedy. Yet this sort of Writers, or Wit-Collectors, are Bloodily angry, if you will not allow all the Wit in their Playes to be their own; and if they see another Man's Play take, Sware <pb xml:id="ep000697-003-a"/>and Bluster, and Bite their Nails; that you'd wonder how they do to Scratch their Heads, to bring forth the next: But I suppose their Nails soon grow agen, and so that's no great Harme. This sort of Men you shall hear say in the Pit, and at the Coffee-House (speaking of an Author) Dam me! How can he Write! He's a Raw Young Fellow, newly come from the University; How can he understand Humour or Character that is just come from a Colledge? Of another they Cry, S'death, he's no Scholler; he can't Write true Grammar: Then strutting, and looking Big; S'blood, sayes he, I understand Greek, as you may see by the Quotations in my Preface, and at the Front of my last New Play: But if they can neither Talk, nor Write a Young Poet out of the Humour of Making Playes, they give him o're for a peremptory Fop▪ and so fall to writing Siedges and Opera's— </p>
        <p>But, Reader, lest by the ensuing Prologue, thou should'st think Me one of that Envious Tribe; know it was Written in Requital to the Prologue, before the <hi>Assignation, or Love in a Nunnery, </hi>and not without Provocation, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Laesit prius</foreign>: But Devils of Wit are not very dangerous, and so we both sleep in whole Skins. </p>
        <p>If you are Inquisitive to know why there are such continual Picques amongst the Poets, I can give you no other Reason than what one Whore told the other— <hi>Two of a Trade can seldome agree</hi>— Now by way of Excuse for this Comedy, let me acquaint you, that it was written at the Desire of the Young Men of the Stage, and given them for a <hi>Lenten Play</hi>; they ask't it not above a Week before Shrove-Tuesday: In three dayes time, the Three first Act▪ were Made, Transcrib'd, and given them to write out in Parts— The Two last Acts, took me up just so much time▪ one Week compleated it. If this will not excuse it, Thou art as Uncons●onable and Malicious as the Writing Criticks, who say all they can for themselves, and will hear nothing in Defence of others. But I would not have Poets make this a President; for shortness of Time ought not to be pleaded in excuse of Ill Playes, unless on the like Occasion: For the Town I am sure will allow a Man ten Months, nay, ten Years, rather <pb xml:id="ep000697-003-b"/>than ten Dayes, if he will but bring a good One at last. I have much more to say, and as little to the Purpose, as any thing the best of my Fellow- Poets have said; but I'le consider on't a while, and some other time, when I have more Leisure, you shall have it; till then, Reader— </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>THey that observe the Humors of the Stage, </l>
        <l>Find Fools and Heroes best do please this Age, </l>
        <l>But both grown so extravagant, I scarce </l>
        <l>Can tell, if Fool or Hero makes the better Farce: </l>
        <l>As for Example, take our Mamamouchi, </l>
        <l>And then Almansor, that so much did touch ye; </l>
        <l>That Bully Hero, that did kill and slay, </l>
        <l>And conquer ye <hi>Ten Armies </hi>in one day: </l>
        <l>He that from side to side play'd Runnegade, </l>
        <l>That Fought and Lov'd as if he had been mad. </l>
        <l>He that gain'd Victory at ev'ry Stroke, </l>
        <l>And made Kings tremble at each Word he spoke; </l>
        <l>He that could Kill and Damne you with a Look. </l>
        <l>Such are the Heroes, that with you are taking, </l>
        <l>But such as never were of Heavens making: </l>
        <l>Thus, whether Grave or Comick Scenes we write, </l>
        <l>All's turn'd to Farce, by Hero, or by Knight. </l>
        <l>Without one of these Two it is decree'd </l>
        <l>By all of you, that no Play shall succeed. </l>
        <l>An Author did to please you, let his Wit run </l>
        <l>Of late, much on a Serving-Man and Cittern, </l>
        <l>And yet you would not like the Cerenade, </l>
        <l>Nay, and you Damn'd his Nun●s in Masquerade. </l>
        <l>You did his Spanish Sing-Song too abhor, </l>
        <l>Ayeque locura con tanto rigor. </l>
        <l>In fine, the whole by you so much was blam'd, </l>
        <l>To act their Parts, the Players were asham'd; </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000697-004-b"/>
        <l>Ah! how severe your Malice was that Day, </l>
        <l>To Damne at once, the Poet and his Play; </l>
        <l>But why, was your Rage just at that time shown, </l>
        <l>When what the Poet writ, was all his own? </l>
        <l>Till then he borrow'd from Romance, and did Translate, </l>
        <l>And those Playes found a more Indulgent Fate. </l>
        <l>We fear you'l be incens'd again to day, </l>
        <l>But consider, our's is a Lenten Play. </l>
        <l>It was on purpose for the <hi>Young Men </hi>writ, </l>
        <l>And all that's in it is Extempore Wit. </l>
        <l>The Poet sayes, because he did not aime </l>
        <l>At Credit, that he cannot meet with shame; </l>
        <l>We Young-Men too, hope to be free from Blame; </l>
        <l>For we do not design to please the Town </l>
        <l>So much, as to get ev'ry Mans Half-crown: </l>
        <l>And boldly we presume, that your Intent </l>
        <l>Of coming now is for Encouragement. </l>
        <l>Resolve then to be Kind to Us to Day, </l>
        <l>And if You will, to Morrow, Damne the Play. </l>

          <p>Not upon the score of Matrimony; Why, <hi>Iack Lovell</hi>, I'le tell thee I'am now like a Colt in the Fenns, that stragles every where, and feed where I like best: But shou'd I Marry, I shou'd be tether'd to my Spot of ground; at best, confin'd to an Inclosure. </p>

          <l>Yet we engage with full as much Devotion, </l>
          <l>Tho' with less Hope, and far less Execution. </l>
          <l>How e're we ' Adventurers so little Stake, </l>
          <l>'Tis all clear Profit whatsoe're we Take; </l>
          <l>Whil'st they from the large Booty they had got, </l>
          <l>Pay Tribute to the Force that Set them out: </l>
          <l>As if Gay Playes, like Navies, had this Check, </l>
          <l>In a Rich Prize to Plunder but one Deck. </l>
          <l>Yet their Fame's greater, tho' their Gain be less, </l>
          <l>You kindly say, they merited Success. </l>

          <l>Their Triumphs so much above ours prevail, </l>
          <l>You'l own, they Won your Money, which we steal. </l>
          <l>They Conquer a more Honourable way; </l>
          <l>Their Spoyls are Victory, and ours but Prey. </l>

          <l>I'me sure, it has not pleas'd; that is, abus'd you. </l>
