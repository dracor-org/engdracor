        <head>The Mornings Preparation. </head>

        <p n="7">7. The Serjant Trumpet, and Thirty six Trumpets more, whereof Sixteen are His Majesties, the other the Duke of York's: The Serjeant Trumpet wearing not only a Scarf of the Lord Mayors Colours, allowed by his Lordship as his Fee, but also another of the Companies Colours. </p>

The Drum Major to His Majesty, wearing a Scarf of the Companies Colours cross his shoulders; four more of His Majesties Drums and Fises attend the Service, also seven other Drums and two Fifes more, each of them (except His Majesties Servants) are habited in buff-coloured Doublets, black Breeches, and Scarfs about their wasts. </p>
        <p n="9">9. The two City Marshals, riding each of them on Horseback, with six persons to attend them, with Scarfs and Colours of the Companies. </p>
        <p n="10">10. The Foot Marshal and six Attendants, with like Scarfs and Colours. </p>
        <p n="11">11. The Master of Defence, with the same Scarf and Colours, having persons of his own Science to attend him. </p>
        <p n="12">12. Many poor Men Pensioners, accommodated with Gowns and Caps, each of them employed in bearing of Standards and Banners. </p>
        <p n="13">13. Divers other Pensioners, in green Gowns, red Sleeves and Caps, each of them carrying a Javelin in the one hand and a Target in the other, whereon is painted the Coat Armour of their Benefactors. </p>
        <p>Being thus ordered: They are by the Foot Marshal divided into several Divisions, and ranked out by two and two, beginning with the Pensioners in Gowns, and in the Front of them placeth the Companies Ensigns, four Drums and one Fife, which is the lowest and most inferiour Division. </p>
        <p>In the Rere of them fall in four Drums and one Fife, after them the several Pensioners in Coats, bearing several Banners and Standards; after them four <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000595-004-a"/>Trumpets; after the Unicorns and Crest Ensigns of the Company, six Gentlemen Ushers; after them the Budge Batchelors, which conclude the next Division. </p>
        <p>In the Rere of those fall six Trumpets; after them two Gentlemen, bearing two Banners, the one of the Cities, the other of the Companies Arms; after them follow eight Gentlemen Ushers, and then the Foyns Batchelors, which make up another Division. </p>

        <p>In the Rere of them fall in four Drums and six Trumpets; after them three other Gentlemen bearing the Kings, Queens, and Cities Banners; and after them four Gentlemen Ushers; to follow them are appointed four Pages, and after them the Masters and Wardens; which conclude all the Divisions. </p>
        <p>In this Equipage they March from Goldsmiths-Hall to his Lordships House, beginning with the Pensioners, until the Marshal comes, and makes a halt at the Gate, till such time the Lord Mayor and Aldermen are mounted. </p>
        <p>Which being done, the whole Body move towards Guildhall, and at Guild-hall Gate the new Lord Mayor joyneth with the old Lord Mayor and his Attendants: So all of them march through King-street down to Three-Crane Wharf, and then the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and their Attendants, at the West end of the said Wharf take their Barge; the Court of Assistants, the Livery, and the Gentlemen Ushers of those three Divisions, at the East end of the said Wharf; whilst the residue of the Retinue that remain behind, viz. some Gentlemen Ushers, the Budge Batchelors and Foyns Batchelors, repair to places of repose. </p>
        <p>The Lord Mayors, the Goldsmiths, and the several Companies Barges hasten to Westminster; and near White-Fryers a Pleasure-boat adorned with Flags and Streamers salutes his Lordship with several great Guns. His Lordship, the Aldermen, the Company of Goldsmiths, and other Companies landing at Westminster, have a Lane made them, through which they pass to the Hall: And there, having performed several Ceremonial Duties and Obligations, as an Oath to be true and faithful to His Majesty and Government established, with Sealing of Writs in the Courts there held; and having taken leave of the Lords and Barons of the Exchequer, &amp;c. and doing some charitable offices to the poor of that place, return to their Barges; and a Lane being made as before, for their passage to the Waters side, they there imbarge. </p>
        <p>His Lordship, with those attending him (the Companies) land at Pauls-Wharf and other places, in order to their Stands in Cheapside, where he and they are saluted with three Vollies by (the Military Glory of this Nation) the Company of <hi>Artillery Men</hi>, under the Conduct of the most accomplished, <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000595-004-b"/>for Arms and Arts, the Right Worshipful Sir <hi>Thomas Player</hi>, they being all in their Martial Ornaments of Gallantry; some in Buff, with Head-pieces, many of massy Silver, (of whose Honourable Society, his Lordship hath been a worthy Member.) From Pauls-Wharf they March before my Lord through a Gallery of the aforesaid Batchelors and Gentlemen Ushers, who did not go to Westminster; and likewise, the Pensioners and Banners being set in order, ready to March, the Foot-Marshal leads the way, and in the Reer of the Artillery-Company up Pauls-Wharf-hill to the South Church-yard of St. Pauls, where his Lordship is entertained by the First Scene or Pageant, as followeth. </p>

All which represent the Crest and the Supporters of the Ancient, Famous, and Worshipful Company of Gold-Smiths. </p>
        <p>My Lord Mayor, with the Aldermen, drawing near and viewing the Curiosity of this Model, is Complemented by the Figure of Iustice, in this Congratulatory POEM. </p>

          <l>No less than Sol in his <hi>Ecliptick Line</hi>. </l>
          <l>Then I address my Self, Great Sir, to you, </l>
          <l>To whom this Touch-stone, aud these Scales are due: </l>
          <l>The Sword of Justice, your own hand doth Gripe; </l>
          <l>You are the Truth, my Lord, I'm but the Type: </l>

          <l>The best of men have born the worst of Fate. </l>
          <l>But you, my Lord, by Dignity of Spirit, </l>
          <l>Vrbanity and Probity do merit </l>
          <l>The Love and high applause of every Creature </l>
          <l>That is endu'd with Virtue and good Nature. </l>
          <l>No matter what malicious Persons vent; </l>

          <l>To You, that serve your COUNTRY, and your KING. </l>
          <p>The Speech being ended, his Lordship giving a signal of acceptation, and rides with his Retinue through Cheap-side, where he is Jocally obstructed by a Second Pageant of Humour, Fancy, and Drollery, delineated in this Manner. </p>

        <head>A Description of the Second PAGEANT. </head>
        <p>IN the Reer of this Pageant is a Rustick Building in a Quadrangular form, where sitting on four Neeches, are four Figures; on the right Hand sitteth Bacchus, a Person of a swarthy Complexion, with short brown curld Hair, wearing a loose Robe of Purple, a Scarf from the Right Shoulder to the left side, of Grapes and Leaves, a Garland of Ivie on his Head, in his right hand a large Rummiken half fill'd, and in his left hand a Banner of my Lord Mayors. </p>
        <p>On the left side sitteth Sylvanus, God of the Woods, in a long Russet Robe, painted all over with Trees, Birds, and Beasts; on his Head, a Peruke of long curl'd grey Hair, and about it, a Chaplet of Oaken leaves, intermingled with Sprigs of Acorns, and their Apples; in his right Hand a Wood-bill, with a long Silver Staff, and in his left, a Banner of the Companies Arms. </p>
        <pb n="5" xml:id="ep000595-005-b"/>
        <p>In the Reer, upon a Third Angle, sitteth Phigalia, a Dryad, or Wood Nymph, in a Robe of French Green, with a Scarf of Gold; a long curld brown Hair, and about her Head a Garland of Wild-flowers, and under her left Arm a Cornucopia, of wild Fruits; and in her right Hand a Banner of the Fishmongers. On the Fourth Angle, another Nymph, with a Silk Ash-colour'd Robe, with a Scarf, fringed with Green and Silver, with a Banner of the City. </p>
        <p>The ascent to this Rustick Mansion, is natively imbroider'd with Brambles, Thorns, and Bryers, of all sorts, bearing large visible clusters of Berries, red, black, and green, Hipps and Haws, &amp;c. with small Trees, laden with wild Fruits; and at the foot of this building on the right Hand, under Bacchus, flourisheth an orderly planted Vineyard, wearing green and yellow Leaves, as in Autum, intermingled with large Clusters of plump Grapes, with Vinitorians and Vine-dressers, in naked Tauny Shapes, with Grapes and Leaves bound about their Heads and Middle. </p>
        <p>On the left hand is a Forrest, properly accomodated and wildly adorned with variety of Trees, Ravenous Beasts and Birds, Inhabited by Satyrs, which are form'd like Goats from the middle downwards, with Goats Feet, and Mens Heads, with short black curl'd Hair, and upright Horns, with hairy Bodies. </p>
        <p>Also divers Wood Nymphs the Dryades, and Hamadryades, significantly attired, in green Silk Robes, and gray Silk Mantles, fringed with Gold and Silver, wearing about their Heads, Garlands of Wood-bine, Honey-Suckles, Wild-Roses, Marjoram, and wild Thyme; Their action properly is Dancing in Rings, which the Sylvans and Satyrs perceiving, they mingle in their Measures, and Dance with them several Art-less Roundelayes, to the Musick of a Piper. </p>
        <p>His Lordship having delightfully past a short space of time in the observation and survey of this ingenuous Model of Rusticity, the Pageant moveth one way, and my Lord another, until he come against Bow-Church, where a Third Pageant doth interpose, and his Lordship is kindly intercepted with a Scene call'd the Orfery, according to this following Description. </p>

        <head>The Third PAGEANT. </head>
        <p>ON a very large Pageant, is a very rich Seat of State, containing the Representor of, the Patron to the Goldsmiths Company, Saint Dunstan, attired in a dress properly expressing his Prelatical Dignity, in a Robe of fine white Lawn, over which he weareth a Cope or Vest of costly bright Cloth of Gold, down to the ground; on his Reverend grey Head, a golden Mytre, set with Topaz, Ruby, Emrald, Amethyst and Saphyr; in his left Hand he holdeth a golden Crosier, and in his right Hand he useth a pair of Goldsmiths Tongs: Beneath these Steps of Ascension to his Chair, in opposition <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000595-006-a"/>to St. Dunstan, is properly planted a Goldsmiths Forge and Furnace, with fire and Gold in it, a Workman blowing with the Bellows: On his right and left hand there is a large Press of Gold and Silver Plate, representing a Shop of Trade: And further in front, are several Artificers at work on Anvils with Hammers, beating out Plate fit for the forgery and formation of several Vessels in Gold and Silver. There are likewise in the Shop, divers Wedges or Ingots of Gold and Silver. And a Step below St. Dunstan, sitteth an Assay Master, with his Class Frame and Ballance, for Trial of Gold and Silver, according to the Standard. In another place, there is also disgrossing, drawing, and flatting of Gold and Silver Wyer. There are also Finers melting, smelting, fining, and parting Gold and Silver, both by fire and water. And in a March before this Orfery, are divers Miners in Canvass Breeches, red Wastcoats and red Caps, bearing Spades, Pickaxes, Twibills and Crows, fit to sink Shafts and make Addits. The Devil also appearing to St. Dunstan, is catch'd by the Nose at a proper Qu. which is given in his Speech. When the Speech is spoken, the great Anvil is set forth, with a Silversmith holding on it a Plate of Massie Silver, and three other Workmen at work, keeping excellent time in their orderly strokes upon the Anvil. </p>
        <p>His Lordship having well survey'd the Curiosity of the Design, the good order of the Scene, with the variety and aptitude of the whole Concern: Being attentively fixt, St. Dunstan rising up, all the Workmen cease, whilst he maketh Addresses to my Lord, in this ensuing Metrical Congratulation. </p>
