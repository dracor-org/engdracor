        <head>To the Right Honourable Henry Earl of Arundel, and Lord Mowbray. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>'TIs long that I have with great impatience waited some opportunity to declare my infinite Respect to your Lordship; coming, I may say, into the World with a Veneration for your Illustrious Family, and being brought up with continual Praises of the Renowned Actions of your glorious Ancestors, both in War and Peace, so famous over the Christian World for their Vertue, Piety, and Learning, their elevated Birth, and greatness of Courage, and of whom all our English History are full of the Wonders of their Lives: A Family of so ancient Nobility, and from whom so many Hero's have proceeded to bless and serve their King and Country, that all Ages and all Nations mention 'em even with Adoration. My self have been in this our Age an Eye and Ear-witness, with what Transports of Joy, with what unusual Respect and Ceremony, above what we pay to Mankind, the very Name of the Great Howards of Norfolk and Arundel, have been celebrated on Forein Shores! And when any one of your Illustrious Family have pass'd the Streets, the People throng'd to praise and bless him, as soon as his Name has been made known to the glad Croud. This I have seen with a Joy that became a true English heart, (who truly venerate its brave Country-men) and joyn'd my dutiful Respects and Praises with the most devout; but never had the happiness yet of any opportunity to express particularly that Admiration I have and ever had for your Lordship and your Great Family. Still, I say, I did <pb xml:id="ep000443-003-a"/>admire you, still I wisht and pray'd for you; 'twas all I cou'd or durst: But as my Esteem for your Lordship dayly increas'd with my Judgment, so nothing cou'd bring it to a more absolute height and perfection, than to observe in these troublesome times, this Age of Lying, Peaching, and Swearing, with what noble Prudence, what steadiness of Mind, what Loyalty and Conduct you have evaded the Snare, that 'twas to be fear'd was laid for all the Good, the Brave, and Loyal, for all that truly lov'd our best of Kings and this distracted Country. A thousand times I have wept for fear that Impudence and Malice wou'd extend so far as to stain your Noble and ever-Loyal Family with its unavoidable Imputations; and as often for joy, to see how undauntedly both the Illustrious Duke your Father, and your self, stem'd the raging Torrent that threatned, with yours, the ruine of the King and Kingdom; all which had not power to shake your Constancy or Loyalty: for which, may Heaven and Earth reward and bless you; the noble Examples to thousands of failing hearts, who from so great a President of Loyalty, became confirm'd. May Heaven and Earth bless you for your pious and resolute bravery of Mind, and heroick Honesty, when you cry'd, <hi>Not guilty</hi>; that you durst, like your great self, speak Conscientious Truths in a Juncto so vitious, when Truth and Innocence was criminal: and I doubt not but the Soul of that great Sufferer bows down from Heaven in gratitude for that noble service done it. All these and a thousand marks you give of dayly growing Greatness; every day produces to those like me, curious to learn the Story of your Life and Actions, something that even adds a Lustre to your great Name, which one wou'd think cou'd be made no more splendid: some new Goodness, some new act of Loyalty or Courage, comes out <pb xml:id="ep000443-003-b"/>to cheer the World and those that admire you. Nor wou'd I be the last of those that dayly congratulate and celebrate your rising Glory; nor durst I any other way approach you with it, but this humble one, which carries some Excuse along with it. </p>
        <p>Proud of the opportunity then, I most humbly beg your Lordships Patronage of a Comedy, which has nothing to defend it, but the Honour it begs; and nothing to deserve that Honour, but its being in every part true Tory! Loyal all-over! except one Knave, which I hope no body will take to himself; or if he do, I must e'en say, with Hamlet, <q>— Then let the strucken Deer go weep— </q>It has the luck to be well receiv'd in the Town; which (not from my Vanity) pleases me, but that thereby I find Honesty begins to come in fashion again, when Loyalty is approv'd, and Whigism becomes a Jest where'er 'tis met with. And no doubt on't, so long as the Royal Cause has such Patrons as your Lordship, such vigorous and noble Supporters, his Majesty will be great, secure and quiet, the Nation flourishing and happy, and seditious Fools and Knaves that have so long disturb'd the Peace and Tranquility of the World, will become the business and sport of Comedy, and at last the scorn of that Rabble that fondly and blindly worshipt 'em; and whom nothing can so well convince as plain Demonstration, which is ever more powerful and prevailent than Precept, or even Preaching it self. If this have edifi'd effectual, 'tis all I wish; and that your Lordship will be pleas'd to accept the humble Offering, is all I beg, and the greatest Glory I care shou'd be done. </p>

        <head>THE PROLOGUE, Written by Mr. Otway. </head>
        <head type="sub">SPOKEN by Mrs. BARRY. </head>
        <l>HOW vain have prov'd the Labours of the Stage, </l>
        <l>In striving to reclaim a vitious Age! </l>
        <l>Poets may write the Mischief to impeach, </l>
        <l>You care as little what the Poets teach, </l>
        <l>As you regard at Church what Parsons preach. </l>
        <l>But where such Follies and such Vices reign, </l>
        <l>What honest Pen has patience to refrain? </l>
        <l>At Church, in Pews, ye most devoutly snore, </l>
        <l>And here, got dully drunk, ye come to roar; </l>
        <l>Ye go to Church to glout, and Ogle there, </l>
        <l>And come to meet more lewd convenient here: </l>
        <l>With equal Zeal ye honour either place, </l>
        <l>And run so very evenly your Race, </l>
        <l>Y' improve in Wit just as you do in Grace. </l>
        <l>It must be so, some Daemon has possest </l>
        <l>Our Land, and we have never since been blest. </l>
        <l>Y' have seen it all, or heard of its Renown, </l>
        <l>In reverend shape it stalk'd about the Town, </l>
        <l>Six Yeomen tall attending on its frown. </l>
        <l>Sometimes with humble note and zealous lore, </l>
        <l>'Twou'd play the Apostolick Function o'er: </l>
        <l>But, Heav'n have mercy on us when it swore. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000443-004-b"/>
        <l>Whene'er it swore, to prove the Oaths were true, </l>
        <l>Out of its mouth at random Halters flew </l>
        <l>Round some unwary neck, by Magick thrown, </l>
        <l>Though still the cunning Devil sav'd its own: </l>
        <l>For when the Inchantment could no longer last, </l>
        <l>The subtile Pug, most dexterously uncast, </l>
        <l>Left awful form for one more seeming pious, </l>
        <l>And in a moment vary'd to defie us: </l>
        <l>From silken Doctor, home-spun Ananias </l>
        <l>Left the lewd Court, and did in City fix, </l>
        <l>Where still by its old Arts it plays new Tricks, </l>
        <l>And fills the heads of Fools with Politicks. </l>
        <l>This Daemon lately drew in many a Guest, </l>
        <l>To part with zealous Guinny for— no Feast. </l>
        <l>Who, but the most incorrigible Fops, </l>
        <l>For ever doom'd in dismal Cells, call'd Shops, </l>
        <l>To cheat and damn themselves to get their Livings, </l>
        <l>Wou'd lay sweet Money out in Sham-Thanksgivings? </l>
        <l>Sham-Plots you may have paid for o'er and o'er; </l>
        <l>But who ere paid for a Sham-Treat before? </l>
        <l>Had you not better sent your Offerings all, </l>
        <l>Hither to us, than Sequestrators Hall? </l>
        <l>I being your Steward, Iustice had been done ye; </l>
        <l>I cou'd have entertain'd you worth your Money. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, Written by a Person of Quality. SPOKEN by Mrs. BOTELER. </head>
        <l>MY Part, I fear, will take with but a few, </l>
        <l>A rich young Heiress to her first Love true! </l>
        <l>'Tis damn'd unnatural, and past enduring, </l>
        <l>Against the fundamental Laws of Whoring. </l>
        <l>Marrying's the Mask, which Modesty assures, </l>
        <l>Helps to get new, and covers old Amours; </l>
        <l>And Husband sounds so dull to a Town-Bride, </l>
        <l>You now-a-days condemn him ere he's try'd; </l>
        <l>Ere in his Office he's confirm'd Possessor, </l>
        <l>Like Trincaloes you chuse him a Successor, </l>
        <l>In the gay spring of Love, when free from doubts, </l>
        <l>With early shoots his Velvet Forehead sprouts. </l>
        <l>Like a poor Parson bound to hard Indentures, </l>
        <l>You make him pay his First-fruits ere he enters. </l>
        <l>But for short Carnivals of stoln good Cheer, </l>
        <l>You're after forc'd to keep Lent all the Year; </l>
        <l>Till brought at last to a starving Nuns condition, </l>
        <l>You break into our Quarters for Provision: </l>
        <l>Invade Fop-corner with your glaring Beauties, </l>
        <l>And Vice our Loyal Subjects from their Duties. </l>
        <l>Pray, Ladies, ●ave that Province to our care; </l>
        <l>A Fool is the Fee-simple of a Player, </l>
        <l>In which we Women claim a double share. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000443-036-b"/>
        <l>〈◊〉 things the Men are Rulers made; </l>
        <l>〈…〉 Woodcocks is our proper Trade. </l>
        <l>If by Stage-Fops they a poor Living get, </l>
        <l>We can grow rich, thanks to our Mother Wit, </l>
        <l>By the more natural Blockheads in the Pit. </l>
        <l>Take then the Wits, and all their useless Prattles; </l>
        <l>But as for Fools, they are our Goods and Chattels. </l>
        <l>Return, Ingrates, to your first Haunt the Stage; </l>
        <l>We taught your Youth, and help'd your feeble Age. </l>
        <l>What is't you see in Quality we want? </l>
        <l>What can they give you which we cannot grant? </l>
        <l>We have their Pride, their Frolicks, and their Paint. </l>
        <l>We feel the same Youth dancing in our Blood; </l>
        <l>Our dress as gay— All underneath as good. </l>
        <l>Most men have found us hitherto more true, </l>
        <l>And, if we're not abus'd by some of you, </l>
        <l>We●re full as fair— perhaps as wholesome too. </l>
        <l>But if at best our hopeful Sport and Trade is, </l>
        <l>And nothing now will serve you but great Ladies; </l>
        <l>May question'd Marriages your Fortune be, </l>
        <l>And Lawyers drain your Pockets more than we: </l>
        <l>May Iudges puzzle a clear Case with Laws, </l>
        <l>And Musquetoon at last decide the Cause. </l>
