        <head>TO MY HONOVRED friend, master Thomas May, vpon his Comedy, The Heire. </head>
        <l>THe Heire being borne, was in his tender age </l>
        <l>Rockt in the Cradle of a priuate Stage, </l>
        <l>Where lifted vp by many a willing hand, </l>
        <l>The child doth from the first day fairely stand, </l>
        <l>Since, hauing gathered strength, he dares preferre </l>
        <l>His steps into the publicke Theater </l>
        <l>The World: where he dispaires not but to find </l>
        <l>A doome from men more able, but lesse kind. </l>
        <l>I but his Vsher am, yet if my word </l>
        <l>May passe, I dare be bound he will afford </l>
        <l>Things must deserue a welcome, it well knowne </l>
        <l>Such as best writers would haue wisht their owne. </l>
        <l>You shall obserue his words in order meete, </l>
        <l>And often stealing on, with equall feete </l>
        <l>Slide into equall numbers, with such grace </l>
        <l>As each word had beene moulded for that place. </l>
        <l>You shall perceiue an amorous passion, spun </l>
        <l>Into so smooth a web, as had the sunne, </l>
        <l>When he pursu'd the swiftly flying Maid, </l>
        <l>Courted her in such language she had staid, </l>
        <l>A loue so well exprest must be the same, </l>
        <l>The Author felt himselfe from his faire flame. </l>
        <l>The whole plot doth like it selfe disclose </l>
        <l>Through the fiue Acts, as doth a Looke, that goes </l>
        <l>With letters, for till euery one be knowne, </l>
        <l>The Lock's as fast as if you had found none. </l>
        <l>And where his sportiue Muse doth draw a thred </l>
        <l>Of mirth, chast Matrons may not blush to reade. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000176-003-a"/>
        <l>Thus haue I thought it fitter to reueale </l>
        <l>My want of art (deare friend) then to conceale </l>
        <l>My loue. It did appeare I did not meane </l>
        <l>So to commend thy well-wrought Comicke-Sceane, </l>
        <l>As men might iudge my arme rather to be, </l>
        <l>To gaine praise to,, then giue it thee; </l>
        <l>Though I can giue thee none but what thou hast </l>
        <l>Deseru'd, and what must my faint breath outlast. </l>
        <l>Yet was this garment (though I skillesse be </l>
        <l>To take thy measure) onely made for thee, </l>
        <l>And if it proue to scant, 'tis cause the stuffe </l>
        <l>Nature allow'd me, was not large enough. </l>
