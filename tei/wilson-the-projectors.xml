      IT is so hard to please, when things must be

      Mouldy with Age, or gilt with Novelty;

     <l>
      That, in effect, 'tis but a Cross, or Pile,

     <l>
      In all that's written, whether well, or ill:
     </l>
     <l>
      Nor have we ventur'd on this liberty,

     <l>
      That we suspect your judgments&#8212; no&#8212; they're free;
     </l>
     <l>
      Free, as that Reason that inform'd 'em first,
     </l>

     </l>
     <l>
      Once shaken off, would be the same agen;

     <l>
      What shall I say?&#8212; shall I entre at ye then?
     </l>
     <l>
      A poor inducement!&#8212; If ye will not do't,
     </l>
     <l>
      Out of good Nature, let me bribe ye to't:
     </l>
     <l>
      I&#8212; now ye hearken&#8212; But mistake me not;
     </l>
     <l>
      We give no mony back&#8212; That were a plot
     </l>
     <l>
      Upon our selves&#8212; Yet we've as good a shift;
     </l>
     <l>
      Ye that would learn to thrive, we'll teach ye Thrift;
     </l>
     <l>
      And ye that would get more&#8212; Why faith&#8212; for you,
     </l>
     <l>
      We have&#8212; The Lord knows what&#8212; new Projects too;
     </l>
     <l>
      And you '&#8212; I forget my self&#8212; To run too far,

        Truly you have hit upon one of the main points,&#8212; and part of the reason why my Master made you privy to it;&#8212; for as on one hand, we must take in some Sharers to lessen the charge, so on t'other, it behoves us to consider how many we may admit, for fear of diminishing the profits.

       Or rather take pattern from the Prudent Dutch, tell him your house is visited, and so carry him to the next Inn, and there eat upon his purse,&#8212; Two mens meals well sav'd&#8212; But one thing more which I had quite forgot&#8212; If ever you should chance to keep Servants, change 'em often; they are generally diligent in their new clothes&#8212; And for their service&#8212; Let every one perform two Offices at least; following herein the example of the same thrifty Dutch, with whom (generally) one and the same person supplies the several Offices of Chaplain and Barber.

(peace be with him that first invented it) The Limbeck, I say, that be it never so full, gives back again, but drop by drop&#8212; Which that you may the better do, let me advise you, first, to avoid Law-suits, it being like a Sheep's flying for shelter to a Bramble, where commonly he leaves the better part of his Fleece behind him&#8212; Next, give no mony to Servants, it being in effect a paying for your entertainment&#8212; and as little, upon hopes of return, Ingratitude reigns&#8212; Then, never fish with a golden hook for fear you lose it, or that the profit do not countervail the hazard and charge&#8212; But this I would have you&#8212; when you have any business doing, let your hand be either fumbling about your little pocket, or playing with some gold&#8212; Ah!&#8212; it makes a man so nimble when he believes it will be his presently&#8212; But when 'tis done, give him ne'r a groat; onely shake him by the hand,

     BEfore the three first Acts you'l find Scaen. 1. Wherin the Printer mistook his Copy; be pleased to blot 'em: each Act being but one Scaene, and the Stage throughout the whole Play kept full,&#8212; The rest, being at most but literal, leaves to your favour.

     </l>
     <l>
      That first wrapt Truth in Tales, had their intents.
     </l>
     <l>
      Full well they knew, nothing discover'd Vice,
     </l>

     </l>
     <l>
      Then does its Work, when it reforms the Age.
