          <l>Mouldy with Age, or gilt with Novelty; </l>
          <l>That, in effect, 'tis but a Cross, or Pile, </l>
          <l>In all that's written, whether well, or ill: </l>
          <l>Nor have we ventur'd on this liberty, </l>
          <l>That we suspect your judgments— no— they're free; </l>
          <l>Free, as that Reason that inform'd 'em first, </l>
          <l>And, were those common cloggs of Interest </l>
          <l>Once shaken off, would be the same agen; </l>
          <l>What shall I say?— shall I entre at ye then? </l>
          <l>A poor inducement!— If ye will not do't, </l>
          <l>Out of good Nature, let me bribe ye to't: </l>
          <l>I— now ye hearken— But mistake me not; </l>
          <l>We give no mony back— That were a plot </l>
          <l>Upon our selves— Yet we've as good a shift; </l>
          <l>Ye that would learn to thrive, we'll teach ye Thrift; </l>
          <l>And ye that would get more— Why faith— for you, </l>
          <l>We have— The Lord knows what— new Projects too; </l>
          <l>And you '— I forget my self— To run too far, </l>
          <l>May chance to cloy ye, ere you see your fare. </l>

              <p>Truly you have hit upon one of the main points,— and part of the reason why my Master made you privy to it;— for as on one hand, we must take in some Sharers to lessen the charge, so on t'other, it behoves us to consider how many we may admit, for fear of diminishing the profits. </p>

Nor need we fear any mans stealing him: Smithfield at the end of a long Vacation cann't shew such another Wall-ey'd, Crest-falne, Saddle-back't, Flat-rib d, Gut-founder'd, Shoulder-pitcht, Spur-gall'd, Hip-shotten, Greese-moulten jade; besides Splint, Spavin, Glanders, Farce, String-halt, Sprains, Scratches, Malander, and Wind-galls innumerable.— Like the fools Hobby-horse; were it not for the name of a horse, a man had as lief go a foot:— and thus we jogg on in grief together.— But hold,— I hear him,— somewhat's amiss. </p>
