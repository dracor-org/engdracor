            <p>Why this is as it should be; now doe I smell Courtier already, I feele the Souldier steale out of me by degrees, for Souldier and Courtier can hardly dwell both together in one bosome. I have a kind of fawning humour creeping upon me as soone as I but look't into the Court-gate; and now could I take a bribe, if any would be so foolish to gee't me. Now farewell Gun-powder, I must change thee into Damask-powder; for if I offer but to smell like a souldier, the Courtiers will stop their noses when they passe by me. My cask I must change to a Cap and a Feather, my Bandileero to a Skarfe to hang my Sword in, and indeede, fashion my selfe wholly to the humours of the time. My Peece I must alter to a Poynado, and my Pike to a Pickadevant: onely this is my comfort, that our provant will be better here in the Court than in the Campe: there we did use to lye <pb xml:id="ep000076-033-a"/>hard, and seldome: here I must practise to lye extreamely, and often: But whil'st I am trifling here, I shall loose the fight of the Solemnity: The Prince is married, and the Martiall's married, and my Master's married, there will be simple doings at night. Well, I must hence, for I beleeve, the King, the Queene, and the rest of the Lords will use this place for their revells. Dixi. </p>

        <l>We know (and not long since) there was a time, </l>
        <l>Strong lines were not lookt after, but if rime, </l>
        <l>O then 'twas excellent: who but beleeves, </l>
        <l>But Doublets with stuft bellies and bigge sleeves, </l>
        <l>And those Trunke-hose, which now the age doth scorn, </l>
        <l>Were all in fashion, and with frequence worne; </l>
        <l>And what's now out of date, who is't can tell, </l>
