        <head>TO HENRY Lord OGLE, SON to his GRACE HENRY Duke of NEWCASTLE, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>THE great Obligations I received from my most Noble Patron, your illustrious Grandfather, and the favours conferred upon me by your Excellent Father (amongst which, I can think none greater than his recommending me to your Lordships Kindness and Protection) have engaged me to make this acknowledgment of my Duty to your Lordship; and to beg that you will own me, and defend this Comedy. I hope I shall, hereafter, be able to present you with something more worthy your Acceptance; but let this suffice to give you a title to me, and all my endeavors, which, as often as I can, shall be employ'd to serve you. </p>
        <p>Had you not been obliged by the commands of your Father to favour and protect me; yet, from you I should have hop'd to have found Patronage; for the great Love which you have for Arts and Sciences, which would have made you cherish my endeavors towards them: By this inclination you give us early proofs of your inheriting the Vertues of your Ancestors, as you are like to do their Fortunes; which with the great accession by your Match with the Noble and Renowned Family of the Piercies, will make your Lordship the greatest Subject of England. And, by your early Vertues, you give all, that know you, hopes that you will be able to maintain that Character, by all the qualities that become a great Man: And, from the two Noble Stocks of Cavendish and Piercy, Posterity is like <pb xml:id="ep000740-003-a"/>to see a race of true▪, and not Romantick Heroes, who may serve their Prince virtuously, and that way oblige their Countrey as we doubt not but your Lordship will. </p>
        <p>My Lord, it has been the custom of Dedicators of late to make the Praises they give to their Patrons so▪ extravagant, that they become Abuses, and therefore I am loath to say what I think: only one virtue of your Lordships I am too much pleas'd with not to mention; which is, that in this Age, when Learning is grown contemptible to those who ought most to advance it, and Greek and Latin Sence is despised, and French and English Nonsence applauded, when the ancient Nobility and Gentry of England, who not long since were famous for their Learning, have now sent into the World a certain kind of spurious brood of illiterate and degenerous Youth, your Lordship dares love Books, and labour to have Learning. And may your Lordship go on in this virtuous race you have begun, that so you may be a Protection to your Servants, a Consolation to your Friends, and an Honour to your Countrey; which is the hearty Wish of </p>

          <l>When Wit won't sell, and they shall lose French Wine. </l>
          <l>And what can Players hope for in these days, </l>
          <l>When e'r the Idle Youth forsake our Plays. </l>
          <l>The empty Head, that never thought before </l>

          <l>Who, without us, no Afternoon could spend, </l>
          <l>Nor shew Himself, nor meet a secret Friend, </l>
          <l>Whom mounting from the Pit we use to see </l>
          <l>(For dangerous Intrigues) to'th' Gallery. </l>
          <l>Where stead of Maidenheads 'tis oft his hap </l>
