        <p>I Have ever had so little Faith for Apologies, that I rather believ'd they did more hurt than good; and for the most part, left things in a worse condition than they found them: The sense of this, made me pass some late censures in silence; and perhaps, might have oblig'd me to the same still, had I not found a dust rais'd, and believ'd it my concern to blow it off, at least, endeavour it:&#8212; To come to the matter; This Comedy was lately Acted, and (as it fares with things of this nature) variously receiv'd; Nor could I well have expected other; It were too much fondness (not to say worse) to tax that freedom in another, which I should think hard, to be deny'd my self:&#8212; No&#8212; this is nothing of the point; All that I take notice of, is this, How justly it may have deserv'd all that has been said upon't; unless People would have it dealt with like <hi>Don Quixot's </hi>Library, some burnt for the Curate's sake, other for the Barber's, and not the least for the good Womans:&#8212; Not to detain you longer in the Porch, I have at present, but this short request, That it may speak for it self:&#8212; And first, (to take the parts as they lye) I shall begin with Bilboe, and <hi>Titere Tu</hi>; the one, usurping the name of a Major, the other, of a Captain, whereas in truth (and as may be gather'd from their discourse) they never were either, or scarcely, any thing like it:&#8212; A humour that can be no wise strange, to any man that knew this Town, between the years 46, and 50, and being so <pb xml:id="ep000784-003-a"/>understood; will be as unlikely to prove an occasion of scandal, to any person of Honour; For if I have shewn the odd practices of two vain persons, pretending to what they were not, I think I have sufficiently justifi'd the Brave man, even by this Reason, That the Exception proves the Rule:&#8212; And further, if there be any thing in their language, that may seem loose, be pleased to consider who they are that speak it; and then I hope you'll thus far absolve me, as to say, I had as ill brought 'um in, with a pair of Beads at their Girdle, as my Puritan Constable, with a Feather in's Cap:&#8212; But secondly, for the Second Scene, I am confident I may passe it, and come to the Third, where (and in other parts of the Play) if you meet with a small pretender to Astrology, Physick, the Rosy-crucian humour, Fortune-telling, and I know not what; or in the fifth Act, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Qualiacunque voles vendentem somnia,</foreign>&#8212; I shall, instead of plea to it, only enlarge my request, That you would but run over the late Adventures of that kind, the sad effects of which, may be well fear'd to live among the people, when the persons that writ'um, may be either dead, or forgotten:&#8212; Nor do I think I ought to ask pardon, that I have taken a Levite, to this Teraphim, since whoever shall give himself the trouble of enquiry, will (without the least force upon the Text) easily find, that both alike have spoken vanity:&#8212; But fourthly, for what concerns Runter, though I think I might have let that pass too, yet, because I would not be mis-understood, give me leave to believe, That no wise man can conceive either Profession, viz. Common, or Civil Law, could be intended in it:&#8212; For as to the first, those that know my way of education, will be ready to excuse me thus far, That had I design'd that, I must necessarily have laid it another way, and perhaps too, might have been able to have don't;&#8212; Or if I had struck at the latter, That I was not so altogether a stranger to it, as not to have run it higher;&#8212; Let this suffice to both, That I made use of no more, than what serv'd to my purpose, and so I leave it to a favourable interpretation, and come to the fifth Scene, viz. Mr. Scruple, where, if any man shall say, I have trod too near upon Religion, I hope, upon his second thoughts, I may trust my cause with him; when, if he shall rightly understand it, he will easily perceive, That I have only shewn how that venerable Name has been abus'd, and that best Thing, made Bawd to the worst actions:&#8212; Lastly, to any man that shall say, such or such humours have either been in the Town before, or formerly writ upon, give me leave to offer this to <pb xml:id="ep000784-003-b"/>the first, That Comedy, either is, or should be, the true Picture of Vertue, or Vice; yet so drawn, as to shew a man how to follow the one, and avoid the other; in doing which, if I had fram'd any thing that was not, I had not only bely'd the Town, but wrong'd my self:&#8212; Doth not Martial say of his Epigrams, <hi>Dictavit auditor</hi>? And was not <foreign xml:lang="lat">Quicquid agant homines</foreign>&#8212; Horace's <hi>farrago?</hi>&#8212; As to the second, If it has been said so long since, That there is nothing which has not been before, I hope (if I may have border'd upon any one that has gone before) I am thus far excusable, that I have purposely declin'd both his matter, and his way:&#8212; To which, if the contrary shall chance to be objected, I think it enough at present to say, That I am in Possession, and a bare <hi>They say</hi>, without shewing, and comparing the place, will not be sufficient to evict me out of it:&#8212; To be short, were there nothing more, even this were enough, That there is hardly any thing left to write upon, but what either the Antients or Moderns have some way or other touch'd on;&#8212; Did not Apulejus take the rise of his <hi>Golden Asse</hi>, from Lucian's Lucius? and Erasmus, his Alcumistica, from <hi>Chaucer's Canons Yeomans Tale</hi>? and <hi>Ben. Johnson</hi>, his more happy Alchymist, from both?&#8212; The Argument were everlasting <foreign xml:lang="lat">&#8212; Sed Cynthius aurem Vellit, &amp; admonuit&#8212; </foreign>And therefore upon the whole matter, whoever may have seen the Play, or shall happen to read this, I have but two things more to begge of him,&#8212; the one, That by a new Comment, he pick not out any ill meaning, which I never intended: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Improb&#232; facit, qui in alieno libro ingeniosus est:&#8212; </foreign>The other, That he remember that of the Tragedian, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Si judicas, cognosce:</foreign>&#8212; And then perhaps, I may have deserv'd his thanks, That I thus hung out the Buoy, to discover the Rock, and drew the Curtain from an old Cheat, to no other end, but to prevent a new.&#8212; Farewel. </p>
