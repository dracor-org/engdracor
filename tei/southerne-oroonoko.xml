      MY LORD,

    <p>
     THE Best part of the Fortune of my last Play
     <hi>
      (The Innocent Adultery
     </hi>
     ) was, that it gave me an Opportunity of making my self known to Your Grace. You were pleased to countenance the Advances which I had been a great while directing and aiming at You, and have since encourag'd me into an Industry, which, I hope, will allow me in this Play to own (which is the only way I can) the great Obligations I have to You.
    </p>
    <pb xml:id="ep000755-003-a"/>
    <p>
     I stand engag'd to Mrs. Behn for the Occasion of a most Passionate Distress in my Last Play; and in a Conscience that I had not made her a sufficient Acknowledgment, I have run further into her Debt for Oroonoko, with a Design to oblige me to be honest; and that every one may find me out for Ingratitude, when I don't say all that's sit for me upon that Subject. She had a great Command of the Stage; and I have often wonder'd that she would bury her Favourite Hero in a Novel, when she might have reviv'd him in the Scene. She thought either that no Actor could represent him; or she could not bear him represented: And I believe the last, when I remember what I have heard from a Friend of hers, That she always told his Story, more feelingly, than she writ it. Whatever happen'd to him at Surinam, he has mended his Condition in England. He was born here under Your Grace's Influence; and that has carried his Fortune farther into the World, than all the Poetical Stars that I could have sollicited for his Success. It was Your Opinion,
     <hi>
      My Lord
     </hi>
     , that directed me to Mr. Verbruggen; and it was his Care to maintain Your Opinion, that directed the Town to me, the Better Part of it, the People of Quality; whose Favours as I am proud of, I shall always be industrious to preserve.
    </p>
    <p>
     <hi>
      My Lord
     </hi>
     , I know the Respect and Reverence which in this Address I ought to appear in before You, who are so intimate with the Ancients, so general
     <pb xml:id="ep000755-003-b"/>
     a Knower of the several Species of Poetry, and so Just a Judge in the Trials of this kind. You have an Absolute Power to Arraign and Convict, but a prevailing Inclination to Pardon and Save; and from the Humanity of Your Temper, and the true Knowledge of the Difficulties of succeeding this way, never aggravate or insist upon Faults

     The Favour of Great Men is the Poets Inheritance, and all Ages have allow'd 'em to put in their Claim; I only wish that I had Merit enough to prefer me to Your Grace: That I might deserve in some measure that Patronage which You are pleased to bestow on me: That I were a Horace for such a Mecoenas: That I could describe what I admire; and tell the World what I really think, That as You possess those Infinite Advantages of Nature and Fortune in so Eminent a degree; that as You so far excel in the Perfections of Body and Mind, You were design'd and fashion'd a Prince, to be the Honour of the Nation, and the Grace and Ornament of the Court. Sir,

     Sent by an Unknown Hand. And Spoken by Mr. Powell.
    </head>
    <l>
     AS when in Hostile Times two Neighbouring States
    </l>
    <l>
     Strive by themselves, and their Confederates;
    </l>
    <l>
     The War at first is made with awkard Skill,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Soldiers clumsily each other kill:
    </l>
    <l>
     Till time at length their untaught Fury tames,
    </l>
    <l>
     And into Rules their heedless Rage reclaims:
    </l>
    <l>
     Then every Science by degrees is made
    </l>
    <l>
     Subservient to the Man-destroying Trade:
    </l>
    <l>
     Wit, Wisdom, Reading, Observation, Art;
    </l>
    <l>
     A well-turn'd Head to guide a Generous Heart.
    </l>
    <l>
     So it may prove with our Contending Stages,
    </l>
    <l>
     If you will kindly but supply their Wages:
    </l>
    <l>
     Which you with ease may furnish, by retrenching
    </l>
    <l>
     Your Superfluities of Wine and Wenching.
    </l>
    <l>
     who'd grudge to spare from Riot and hard Drinking,
    </l>
    <l>
     To lay it out on means to mend his thinking?
    </l>
    <l>
     To follow such Advice you shou'd have leisure,
    </l>
    <l>
     Since what refines your Sense, refines your Pleasure:
    </l>
    <l>
     Women grown tame by Use each Fool can get,
    </l>
    <l>
     But Cuckolds all are made by Men of Wit.
    </l>
    <l>
     To Virgin Favours Fools have no pretence:
    </l>
    <l>
     For Maidenheads were made for Men of Sense.
    </l>
    <l>
     'Tis not enough to have a Horse well bred,
    </l>
    <l>
     To shew his Mettle, he must be well fed:
    </l>
    <l>
     Nor is it all in Provender and Breed,
    </l>
    <l>
     He must be try'd and strain'd, to mend his speed:
    </l>
    <l>
     A Favour'd Poet, like a Pamper'd Horse,
    </l>
    <l>
     Will strain his Eye-balls out to win the Course.
    </l>
    <l>
     Do you but in your Wisdoms vote it fit
    </l>
    <l>
     To yield due Succors to this War of Wit,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Buskin with more grace shall tread the Stage,
    </l>
    <l>
     Love sigh in softer Strains, Heroes less Rage:
    </l>
    <l>
     Satyr shall show a Triple Row of Teeth,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Comedy shall laugh your Fops to death:
    </l>
    <pb xml:id="ep000755-005-a"/>
    <l>
     Wit shall refine, and Pegasus shall foam,
    </l>
    <l>
     And soar in search of Ancient Greece and Rome.
    </l>
    <l>
     And since the Nation's in the Conquering Fit,
    </l>
    <l>
     As you by Arms, we'll vanquish France in Wit:
    </l>
    <l>
     The Work were over, cou'd our Poets write
    </l>
    <l>
     With half the Spirit that our Soldiers fight.

        O, yes, they know what they wou'd have. They wou'd have a Woman give the Town a Pattern of her Person and Beauty, and not stay in it so long to have the whole Piece worn out. They wou'd have the Good Face only discover'd, and not the Folly that commonly goes along with it. They say there is a vast Stock of Beauty in the Nation, but a great part of it lies in unprofitable hands; therefore for the good of the Publick, they wou'd have a Draught made once a Quarter, send the decaying Beauties for Breeders into the Countrey, to make room for New Faces to appear, to countenance the Pleasures of the Town.

        Not half the time taken notice of, Sister. The Two or Three last Years we could make nothing of it, even in a Vizard-Masque; not in a Vizard-Masque, that has cheated many a man into an old acquaintance. Our Faces began to be as familiar to the Men of Intrigue, as their Duns, and as much avoided. We durst not appear in Publick Places, and were almost grudg'd a Gallery in the Churches: Even there they had their Jests upon us, and cry'd, She's in the right on't, good Gentlewoman, since no man considers her Body, she does very well indeed to take care of her Soul.

Nay, the young Inns-of-Court Beaus, of but one Term's standing in the Fashion, who knew no body, but as they were shewn 'em by the Orange-Women, had Nicknames for us: How often have they laugh'd out, There goes my Landlady; Is not she come to let Lodgings yet?

        Then, as a certain sign that there was nothing more to be hop'd for, the Maids at the Chocolate-Houses found us out, and laugh'd at us: Our Billet-doux lay there neglected for Waste-Paper: We were cry'd down so low we cou'd not pass upon the City; and became so notorious in our galloping way, from one end of the Town to t'other, that at last we cou'd hardly compass a competent change of Petticoats to disguize us to the Hackney-Coachmen: And then it was near walking a-foot indeed.

If the Women wou'd agree (which they never will) to call home their Effects, how many proper Gentlemen wou'd sneak into another way of living, for want of being responsible in this? then Husbands wou'd be cheaper.

    <l>
     YOU see, we try all Shapes, and Shifts, and Arts,
    </l>
    <l>
     To tempt your Favours, and regain your Hearts.
    </l>
    <l>
     We weep, and laugh, joyn mirth and grief together,
    </l>
    <l>
     Like Rain and Sunshine mixt, in April weather.
    </l>
    <l>
     Your different tasts divide our Poet's Cares:
    </l>
    <l>
     One foot the Sock, t'other the Buskins wears:
    </l>
    <l>
     Thus, while he strives to please, he's forc'd to do't,
    </l>
    <l>
     Like Volscius, hip-hop, in a single Boot.
    </l>
    <l>
     Criticks, he knows, for this may damn his Books:
    </l>
    <l>
     But he makes Feasts for Friends, and not for Cooks.
    </l>
    <l>
     Tho' Errant-Knights of late no favour find,
    </l>
    <l>
     Sure you will be to Ladies-Errant kind.
    </l>
    <l>
     To follow Fame, Knights-Errant make profession:
    </l>
    <l>
     We Damsels flye, to save our Reputation:
    </l>
    <l>
     So they, their Valour show, we, our Discretion.
    </l>
    <l>
     To Lands of Monsters, and fierce Beasts they go:
    </l>
    <l>
     Wee, to those Islands, where Rich Husbands grow:
    </l>
    <l>
     Tho' they're no Monsters, we may make 'em so.
    </l>
    <l>
     If they're of English growth, they'll bear't with patience:
    </l>
    <l>
     But save us from a Spouse of Oroonoko's Nations!
    </l>
    <l>

     Death with a Husband ne'er had shewn such Charms,
    </l>
    <l>
     Had she once dy'd within a Lover's Arms.
    </l>
    <l>
     Her error was from ignorance proceeding:
    </l>
    <l>
     Poor Soul! she wanted some of our Town Breeding.
    </l>
    <l>
     Forgive this Indians fondness of her Spouse;
    </l>
    <l>
     Their Law no Christian Liberty allows:
    </l>
    <l>
     Alas! they make a Conscience of their Vows!
    </l>
    <l>
     If Virtue in a Heathen be a fault;
    </l>
    <l>
     Then Damn the Heathen School, where she was taught.
    </l>
    <l>
     She might have learn'd to Cuckold, Jilt, and Sham,
    </l>
