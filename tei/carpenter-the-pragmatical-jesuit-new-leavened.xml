I often pray to the powers in Heaven, but I swear by them oftner. My heart is most zealous towards the She-Saints above; but I am yet more <pb n="7" rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000494-006-b"/>servent towards the pretty hearts beneath, and if they fail, the Beast fals even to my desires. I more love the Image in holy things, than the Substance: I can be cruel to the raising of horrour and trembling in the hearers, as I have been in the Indies: and leave the Jesuits to colour and cover it with a godly reason; as somthing may be studied in the favour of all things, though never so barbarous and horrid: I can bring torturing whips for England in a Navy, and delegate the Jesuits to forge that I brought them to whip and discipline my self in the Raptures and Ecstasies of my Devotion: I am a true servant to the Jesuits in the promotnig of their ends; but I falsly forget that the end should be good, and the action agreeable: I work mischief slowly, but surely: I shall perform incomparably more: Let this suffice to be spoken. </p>

              <p>Madam, you will not find me empty; a man so near the Fountain-head and so wax-like to the Impression of high things: I abound with all the possible garbs of Devotion, and with Bell-conceptos to garnish them: My Soul is enticed forth every day at my ears, and I am carried wholly out of my self, with the Musick of the Churches; but I direct little attention to the thing signified: I have a Seraglio of women in my thoughts: but the for Boy waits there as most delicious: May it please your Madam-ship; the Turk himself is not so frolick in this kind of Devotion as I am. I stile my self much an admirer and honourer of the Jesuits: but for the ancient Father of the Society in the <foreign xml:lang="lat">casa professa</foreign>; he is <hi>the man </hi>in my breast: I dure let him loose to combate with the old Devil himself in Matchevelism: I own the holy Monuments of the good men in old time; and those are abundantly sufficient to save me: to the which I add a few dull and scanty Devotions; As, once in a hundred years I convert a Jew, and perhaps a whore when she is rotten, old, and past pleasure: I pass and repass many godly Legerdemains in the Inquisition; but I seldom convert any there, except it be into ashes by fire: and if any man prevent me by death, I make a flame-offering of his car case, as I did of Spalato's in <hi>Campo di fiori</hi>; and that believe me, Madam, was a fat one, I had a godly English Friend, who came from England to Rome, the other day, and there mournfully complain'd with much of your spirit, that he had been horribly persecuted by the wild and savage English: and in the Rant of his Tavern-devotion, came headlong down the Tavern Stairs, and broke his neck, beyond the skill of the Bone-setter, &amp; so his hypocritical mouth was stopt. It belongs to this Story, Madam, that a devout Spaniard came a while ago into England with intention to convert it, as having heard that the people were wild, and liv'd in Woods, and Caves of the earth: but arriving at Canterbury, and by most plain and manifold experience finding it otherwise, he fairly, but not softly, return'd from thence wiser than he came. Truly, Madam; we do hatch &amp; patch together many precious &amp; godly Stories in Italy, which though they be somwhat near to good ends, are very wide of truth; and yet good Ends must be fought by <hi>proportionable means</hi>, and Truth wants not the helping hand of Falshood to support it: I am your Vassal at hand to act the rest. </p>

              <speaker>Mr. Kick. </speaker>
              <p>Madam, I do not implunge my self over head and ears into Devotion; because as the Veretians and other high-moving and Eagle-wing'd Italians, I have a noble part of the Atheist within me: but I can play the devout fool prettily and modishly at set times: And of all Nations, I do you most humble service, Madam. For, such a monstrous and long-sided: P 〈…〉, <pb n="8" xml:id="ep000494-007-a"/>such a changeling and phantastical dress, such a Pedlars-pack of Ribbands, concurring with an outward form of Devotion, is the top and top-gallant of Hypocrisie. Besides, the modes and numberless number of Fashions, that never Flanders-Horse was sick of so many, in <hi>benevolous Conjunction </hi>with Godliness, pencil forth and give Hypocrisie in her full splendor. Afterwards, the Complements <hi>a la mode de France</hi>, which multiply words beyond limit, and above Arithmetick, and recount to a Lady her both invisible and impossible Perfections, when they meet in the same point with a scarlet Tincture of Piety, degenerate into perfect Hypocrisie. Madam, I pretend to Valour and a generous heart: and indeed, when I was a Boy in long coats, I rode upon a Bear, as our honorable custom is in Paris, led by the Bear-hood to my Fathers Door; and thence it came, as the speech of the Vulgar goes, that I could never be afraid afterwards of man or beast. And in Paris, the Captains of our Train'd Bands are for the greatest part Taylors, Madam, as I am, not only because they rode upon Bears when they were in Coats and bare behind, but also because they are nimble at their weapon, and to put them in mind of going through-stitch with their work when they fight: And yet, I confess to you, Madam, that when I am well beaten by a Spaniard or an Englishman, I cry <hi>Mon dieu, Mon dieu</hi>: and this is Hypocrisie too, though of a lower Orb. We plead all with one mouth against the Inquisition; but <hi>par ma Foy</hi>, we have a French Inquisition in Paris, otherwise call'd the Bastille, which is not parallel'd by either Italian or Spanish Inquisition: And is it not exalted and sublimated Hypocrisie, when we bear a superlative name near to him above the world, as if we were most abstracted from the world; and yet we teach the world, and all the Phantasmes and lying Legends of the world to all the world. Madam, I am old excellent in the practise of a singular vertue which the precise part of people call Lying: Indeed I can scarce tune my mouth to speak Truth: And I can swear such Oaths, as would blister an ordinary mans ears: I am very quick and pliable at stealing: and then I can salve it, daub it, and guild it over with a Lye: To tell all, is beyond all my power: For the rest, I rest your Tres-humble and restless Serviteur, Monsieur Kickshaw, of Paris, Taylor. </p>

The Habit I wear, is the Dress of an English Jesuit, as he commonly appears in his Countrey. I will not delegate the acting of the Part, to any: I scarce presume upon my own sufficiency, as equal to the Magisterial height of their Performance: Page, Give notice to Madam Hypocrisie, that I come to take a sensible view of her Scholars, and adopt the ripest of them into my Service. If all things fall pliable, because I greatly cover Honour and Adoration, let me be honour'd before these people with her loudest Musick in my entrance: I follow immediatly. <stage xml:id="ep000494-e7170">Exit Lucifuga. </stage>

              <p>Well, Madam; I have dispatcht my Scholar to St. Omers, you may now enter your whole Tribe. Every one shall receive his Charge, and I will discharge you of their persons. Mr. Complement, your charge is, that you stow fire in the Court: Speak every where of Abuses; and of a singular discerning Spirit, and a Holiness which you have, but others are naked of, as prophane: Turn up the white of your eye, and shew it, as if that were the outside of your Soul, according to the Naturalist, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Profectò in oculis animus inhabitat</foreign>; truly the Soul dwels in the eyes: Draw every word through your Nose, as if it past through a middle sort of crack't Organ-Pipe: and lift up your hands towards that which scrupulous men call Heaven, and close them when they are extended, as if you had fast hold of Heaven. Pretend alwaies like an Apton in the first onset, true things, and such as are in use with holy men: those delude irrefragably: The people regard not the tayl of the Business: The Snake having past his head, draws his body after him into the Faction. Tell the people, that by how much an Element is more near to Heaven, it is by so much the more pure, active, noble: that the Water is more pure than the Earth, the Ayr than the Water; and Elementary Fire than the Ayr: That the higher the Ayr is, it is the purer still, and more subtile: That in a Limbeck the things of greatest purity and vertue, are sublimated, that is, hast to the top of the Limbeck; the drossy matter fals. Let there be a new shap't Achates in every period. It is not necessary, that one experiencing if Sea-water be salt, should drink up: the whole Sea: nor that I should foot it over every particular: your own Genius will direct you forward. There is no more excellent manner of cozening and gulling the simple Herd of people, than with the specious Mantle of Religion, because Religion out-powers, and, overswaies all in <pb n="16" xml:id="ep000494-011-a"/>mankind. Mr. Demure, and Gaffer High-shooe; you for the City, and you for the Countrey, are charged accordingly. <hi>Galen junior</hi>, when you are call'd to sick persons, and find that their sicknesses lay close siege to their bodies, first prepare them by some eloquent Preamble. Say, if you see the water in a calm Ser troubled, and rise high into the Ayr, take heed, ther's a Whale near. Turn it homwards thus; Sickness disturbing so highly the peace and tranquility of the Body, Death is imminent. Then make reverend mention of the Society, and recount the numerous Conversions that we have wrought in the world, and press it home to their Consciences, that they leave us honourable Legacies according to their Conditions, yea though they beggar and leave succourless their own dear children: We are not their Heirs at Common Law, but upon a higher account: Tell them, otherwise they are near to a Gulf, a Precipice: Then while the Iron is hot, and upon the Anvile, send for us. If need urge, we shall use you in Deletories, vulgarly call'd poysons, when we prosecute a pious End. But if any of our holy Society be sick, they pay you not, because they pray for you: The Prayers of the Society are above price, and cannot be valued. Ignora, you must wirebind and enchain your self to the common Rabble in the Decisions of Law-cases: affect the names of popular and Patriot: desert noble Interests, though never so just: and though you take Fees on both sides, be sure you herd it with the Rascal Deer; they couch the safest; they are the more numerous, and clamorous. If any case offer it self, wherein the religious profit and emolument of the Society is involv'd, take all shapes, as the Cameleon at Land, the Polypus in the sea; all colours, as the Tarrand in the Garden; before you let your Cause fall: Regard not the poor standing in competition with us; in ballance with us, they are the German Bishops Rats: We are poor, and entangled in debt; though in truth we were never yet acquainted with debt; that's our Pretence, enfranchised, guided and guarded with a religious Equivocation; as far as you know to the contrary, we are in debt. Magnifico, Your charge is clear: you know your match: <hi>The Word </hi>is enough to a Souldier. My three outlandish Imps, ye must away, each with all expedition to his Country. Your Business wherein ye concenter, is, to debase and vilifie the English Nation in all your Discourses, all places: Tell your Countries, that they are a people of degenerous and ungarrison'd Souls, Adamites in understanding; and if they have any, have but a surface-knowledge, and that most paradox to Truth: That they live altogether in Forrests and Caves, and in the white Rocks from which England was named Albion; and eat raw flesh, and oftentimes the flesh of Children: That they are a timorous and soft-fac'd people, unapt for wars; yea ready to entertain a conquest with most humble submission. Mr. <hi>See Senior</hi>, Give your people to understand, that they are the most credulous, and the most noble-soul'd Nation of all others: That if at any time they design another Armado for England, they take a special care they do not provide such an other holy Nun to give a solemn blessing to it; she was afterwards solemnly prov'd to be a Witch. Pray them, that when they work their false Miracles, they will carry their hands, and their invisible juggling-Hair more covertly and cleverly: The falshood of some these times, hath been Chrystal-clear in the view of Reason: the most learned Laureat's of Spain it self, were confounded in the sight of them; and the Inquisition it self was angry, because they were not acted with <pb n="17" xml:id="ep000494-011-b"/>more nimbleness. Tell them, their most prophane and bawdy Comedies in their Processions on their greatest dayes, are not convenient. I cannot be infinite. Commend my brotherly Respects to Father Escobar at Valladolid: Tell him, his Morals thrive wonderfully: The <hi>Mystery of Jesuitisme </hi>is little availeable against them: they have overturn'd all Law, Right, Honesty, and deified the Jesuit, made him the great God of Nature, all cases of Conscience answering, turning, and returning to him, whenas they should return, turn, and answer to him above. Mr. <hi>Signior See</hi>, Recommend my most humble Vassallage to the grand Signior at Rome: Pray his Holiness, that there be sudden provision by pension made here, for the poorer and scab'd sort of Priests; they are in the Antecamera to a falling condition: Ascertain to him, that some of the most active and unquiet Spirits amongst them, have taken Pensions here, to discover the Mysterious Intentions and Actions of Rome and Spain, and at the same time, the very very same, have remain'd pension'd by his Holiness to betray the Affairs of their own Countrey to him: Insomuch that of late, one of them heated and heighten'd in his Cups at a Tavern, and his Friend desiring to depart, said with Cynick Modesty, Stay, Friend, the Pope and the Rebel in England (he nam'd him) shall pay for all: Fail not to lay this at his Holiness his Feet when you kiss them. We of the Society are glewed by a <hi>particular vow of Obedience </hi>to his Holiness: It was the Wisdom of our Patron did it, that our advancements might be joyntly conserved: our Interest is closely twisted and pleaced with his. Signifie to his Holiness, that his wicked Priests get Bastards a pace here; and then, having been overdoers, and over-done themselves, pretend to be only Overseems to the Children: So far forth, that one being demanded why he knav'd it for a Bastard, defended his Act and Monument scholastically with <foreign xml:lang="lat">Aristotles Ipse dixit</foreign>; who saies, that then a living thing is perfect, <foreign xml:lang="lat">quandò general sibi simile in Naturâ, </foreign>when it begets a like to it self in Nature. Pray him to keep the Rithm if not the reason, and uphold constantly the Jews and the Stews; that we may have more honourable Examples of Jewish women turn'd Christians, to the end they may turn whores; which amongst the Jews is highly punishable. Tell him likewise that false Miracles are greatly advantageous to the Cause, if they be done as the Roman School-men speak, <hi>et si non castè, tamen cautè</hi>; although not chastly and truly, yet warily to prevent scandal; wherein our own Honour is more consider'd, than the Honour of him who is most honourable. Monsieur Kickshaw; Load and physick this Nation as far as possibly you can, with the pretty Muld-sack or <hi>Don Quickshot</hi>, of your new Fashions: And as old Rome did abound with the gods of all the Countreys they conquer'd, introduce the Folsies and Drolleries of all the world hither: That best suits with you, that have the best name in the superlative degree: And still wire-draw the people here, with forestalling and diverting their Trade. Forgive my length: My Matter, like an Ocean, had I given way, had over-towr'd me. Let's privately rejoyce a while, as Witches have their private Revellings, and then wee'l take our Leaves. </p>

Escobar the Spanish Jesuit hath open'd a broad way to these loose and heathenish Dresses. O the Jesuits!

Hereticks are merciless, Iron-breasted, Rock-hearted, and people of hardned and petrified Bowels: There is no seed, no footstep of Mercy in then; only perhaps now and then certain arreptitious emications and Star-twincklings of natural, moral, and old- Roman tenderness. If any of these, walking in the painted Galleries of their Imagination, fancy they do works of mercy, when they do thus and thus because others have done so and so before them, they miscarry; For their Mercy is as their Belief, is beleper'd by it; and the stream cannot be cleaner, clearer, higher than the Fountain, or the Branch purer and more generous than the Root. The Magnetisme of Piery hath wrought upon you; and the Torpedo and Remora, the World and Heresie, the Devils Factors, should act no farther by their secret Influx upon your Breast: You have given your Faith to the Firmament, and you must not follow in the train of the Planets; that is, move on, and retrait in the same Line, and in going forward be somtimes periodical and stationary. You are Heaven-sixt: beware of sublunary Divinity. Relapses are dangerous: because Nature after a sickness is unarm'd, and left unable to resist their Assaults. You must pass as a beloved Mirrour of Patience, through all the Topicks and Tacticks of Affliction: which like Galilaeus his Glass, brings most remote things near to you. </p>

Me thinks the Power, if it be a good one, that works these wnoders with reflection upon the Image, should also preserve the miraculous Image from Rottenness, and from the Common people of Creepers the worms.

Yet I find that in all these erroneous deviations, there is some colour or semblance of Truth, or somthing like an Asteriske, or finger pointing to past truths. Thus did the Devils Oracles deliver many sound Truths, the better, under such palliations, to disseminate and publish their most unsound Errours: Thus doth a stink offend us more, when concomitant with some weak Perfume which it hath <foreign xml:lang="lat">pro vehiculo</foreign>, than if it singly sets upon us; the perfume procuring for the stink, easier admittance into our sense: Thus Poysons are most dangerous and irremediable, when joyned in commission with a Cordial that is not able to resist them; it serving to conduct them to the heart, and being unable to vanquish their malignity: Thus the old Fowlers deceived Pigeons by shewing an exoculated Pigeon leaping and dancing in a Net. </p>

              <p>The Nightingale growing fat, cannot sing: I have long fasted. According to the multitude of Operations (be they of the same or a different nature) in which the Soul doth busie her self, she performeth each particular Operation with less obsequiousness and ability, and therefore less perfectly. Because the Soul being finite and limited, her active virtue is also limited and finite; and so fitting and applying her activity to divers operations, she gives the cause that each participateth a less portion thereof. It is not within the Sphere of humane power, that one should at the same very time, observingly contemplate the Feature of a mans face, beheld with his eyes, and judiciously bend his Thoughts to the curious and bewitching Strains of Musick intruding upon his Ears; nor in the same instant attentively discern the Differences and several Garbs of Colour and Figure. Had I a hundred Understandings, and as many Tongues, I have Matter wherewith to lade and load them. Man, there is yet <foreign xml:lang="lat">Terra Incognita</foreign>, a Land unknown to thee, with respect unto knowledge and Religion. The truly knowing <pb n="31" rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000494-018-b"/>people, wheresoever they are, are infallible. He that thinks such a People can fall, fears the ruine of the Firmament, and is more than somwhat like him, who-being Galens Patient, and very sick, told him demanding in the morning how he did; that he had been restless and without sleep all the night; heaving himself from side to side, and heavily groaning; and had been grievously troubled in seriously thinking, what should become of him (sick man) if Atlas, weary now at last, should steal away his out-worn shoulder, and Heaven, with all the Larks in the Ayr, fall upon him lying weak in his Bed. Without Infallibility, there is no certainty, no security. And what are all Professors, compar'd to us? They are deckt like heathenish Indians, with fine Feathers; filch't from Birds, that when they were alive, flew near Heaven; while these, because their feathers are ascititious, cannot fly, can scarcely creep. If they raise an old Truth, like the shape of a fair plant or flower in a Glass, they suddenly draw the flame or Candle away, and let it fall to dull Ashes again. Other men are petty Chapmen, and Pedlers of Divinity: Man, if thou wilt know, know that I am the knowing man: And man, thou maiest know it by this: of a simple and ignorant man, I am suddenly exalted above my self by Rapture. Persons ill-affected in their eyes, many times see two things, when but one presents it self: every man in their seeing, hath two heads, four eyes, two Mouths, two Bodies, four hands, as many feet; and is twice himself, and a double man. Man, thou maiest think me double and deceitful, but the fault is in thy Eyes, not in me. <stage xml:id="ep000494-e17860">He trembles again. </stage>

Gentlemen: I'le open to you a Secret, lock'd up in the close Cabinet of my Thoughts. But, I pray, keep it as a Secret, and tell it not abroad: neither let it pass into the cold ayr: We experimentally find in the world, that Princes have their Jayle; for Offenders, and their Bedlams for mad people: And I know, that— I dare better shew towards him with my hand, than name him here, is the greatest of Princes; and that Hell is his Jayle. And in good sooth I never heard or read of storied forth, never beheld a place, which can now more appliably be call'd his Bedlam than England. But ye will say, How so? England a Bedlam? the great Bedlam of the world? Are all the people of England mad? Soft and fair. I Answer: No. For in a Bedlam-house, the mad people have their sober Keepers, their wise Physitians, their civil Waiters and Servants; and also those, whose Office it is to whip them, and thereby to awake and recal their senses; and one of the last, I hope I shall be.

First, you sent your Letter of commendations by me, and it had certain private Marks in the bottom, according to your private Book of Rules, Politick rules, printed at Rome, and no where else, which I have now seen; and this was to signifie to the Jesuits, that if I refused to be a member of your Society, they might use me <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad libitum</foreign>, at their pleasure. Secondly, You sent Letters every Moneth to the English Colledges at S. Omers, at Valladolid in Spain, and at Rome where I was, to be read in the hearing of all the Scholars; and these Letters recounted wondrous things as done in England, disgraceful to the English, though conducing to the confirmation of the Scholars in their Judgments, which things were neither done, nor feasible. The Business of Garnets Straw was meet Forgery; the Painter afterwards discover'd his own Folly, and yours; and your different Pictures of the Straw (I have seen them) gave evidence against you. Fox, the Authour of the famous Martyrology, never believ'd his Head was an Urinal. The Learned Church-man of England, did not die a Papist. I could exasperate your ears with a thousand of these. Thirdly, I never yet saw a Jesuit or other Priest, of whom I could honestly say, this is a just man, his Heart and his Tongue concur, Truth and his Tongue are Unison: They are Mountebanks in Religion, and have Spawns of Deceit and Equivocation in their Mouths: they religiously keep Matchavels Rule; Bespatter thy Adversary with all sorts of Dirt and filth, <hi>aliquid for sit àn adhaerebit</hi>; it is likely that somwhat of it will stick close to him.

Ye do, ye do: Nearer, nearer yet. I have brought you to half-way Tree on both sides. Still on. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vox populi</foreign>, the voice of the people who best know you, as with an irresistible charm will bring you neerer on both quarters. Are not you nam'd the Puritanical Jesuit, and you the Jesuitical Puritan? Neerer again. I follow the chase. Are ye not both so fevere and rigid in your Directions, Instructions, Counsils, as if ye were both Enthusiasm'd with a singular spirit above all others? Now ye are within the stretch of arms. Do ye not both with the same quibble of cunning insinuate into houses by mens wives, and there Lord it over their Husbands and the whole Family? I must not exceed my portion of time, and speak from the Center beyond the Periphery. Now come close together, joyn hands, imbrace according to the Jesuitical Hugg. Why now ye are friends. O let poor deluded England, be now asham'd of what is past, be provident and circumspect for hereafter. All was Jesuitical: the Jesuit as the evil Genius, was the true and only Malignant: In all the combination and complication of the many-headed Factions, he had access by him self or his Agents to the chief Actours while he blew the coles, with Julian, at the Devil's Altar. And now ye are coupled Ile tell you a Story; it hath, Janus-like, two faces, as looking Romeward and hitherward. Rome was with Child, and she brought forth her eldest Son, the Benedictine; to him as the Heir she gave her Lands: She remain'd free a while; at length was with child again, and brought into the light two children, the Dominican and the Franciscan; to the first, having given away her Lands, she gave certain Houses and monies in a Pensionary manner; to the other, having nothing left, the Wallet, and set him out of doors a beging. She stood clear again, till at last she was mountain-big with child; She long'd, she groan'd, she drew her breath short, she made store of outlandish faces: In the conclusion she gave into the world a lusty Boy, who being newly born utter'd from behind the Midwifes lapfull, a sign of good luck; this was the Jesuit: His Mother having given away Lands, Houses, Wallet, took him up, gave him a smart clap on the right buttock, and said, My dearling, shift for thy self; and he did so most accurately. Turn the story hither: Our Mother here was with child, and with child, again, and again. I so much honour the first-born children, that I shall not name them in this Comical Air; the Presbyterian himself shall pass by me, without a glance upon him: questionless he means well, though he deserves not this Elogy from me, yet I am so sick of the Jesuit and Monk, that I must praise him. But Brother of the Separation, you were the last-born, have run with the Torrent, and shifted for your self, to rejoyce over the Creaturē; and therein you and the Jesuit are uniform. This is all, I take my leave. <stage xml:id="ep000494-e19270">Exit. </stage>

None of our Fathers in their Monasteries would receive him into the Habit, lest he should know more of our inside, and bemire us further: Father Cressy whisper'd to him in his ear, that he was sick of all our Monasteries, and he presently talk't it abroad. He fancies to himself a perfection according to the Primitive Model; and he desires and seeks according to this his Platonical Idea. F. Prior: It is the setled doctrine of the Jesuites, That he who threatens or intends to publish the secrets of a Religious-House may be lawfully kil'd. Now there is a two-fold manner of killing: we may kill directly as the Jesuites do, (which is too publick, incurres too much upon the senses,) or indirectly as we. Let those sufferances be multiplied upon him in the Bastille, that no ordinary man can endure without death, (which is a kind of indirect killing:) If his body be of heart-oake, and he scapes this, to the fire and fagot with him at Rome. </p>

              <p>O Torment! The pangs of Death cannot be more grievous: and my pangs are notoriously more grievous to me than the pangs of Death, because mine are continual. The whole Fabrick of my body is so stifned and benum'd with cold, so bruis'd and sor'd with the hardnesse of the rocky ground, that I cannot use a limb without excessive pain, and shaking of the whole frame. They have detain'd me here in the Bastille the space of fifteen Weeks, without Bed, Covering, Cap, Wastcoate, Shirt, or other Linnen, (the French, my Executioners, rob'd me of all,) without Chair, Stoole, Table, Fire, Candle, Water, Knife, Spoone; without any succour for the necessities of nature, further than the floor of this close and dark Dungeon or Cave where I lye: and by a little peeping-hole I have discover'd a Sentinel continually standing with his Musket, to receive me, if I should appear in the least part of me. Dare these blessed-nam'd Benedictines ever professe, that they are flesh and blood? the wild Indian man-eaters are not more barbarous; nor the bruite beasts of the wildernesse more savage. Can it now be denyed from the consequents of this cruelty, that their lives in their Monasteries are absolutely dissolute, when they endeavour by such unhew'd and Scythian means to forestall the discovery of them. It is likely they will pull to themselves in the covering of their nakednesse other pretences, that as Tiberius the Emperor abused the vestals, they may first render me dishonourable, and then miserable: But here, two things obtain no small surplussage of confirmation; two things which walk it and stalk it as open truths in England, though contradiction be much obstreperous: The first, The people of this Gang, this sharp-pointed fang, are most horribly Cruel: The second, Rome cannot stand without the prop of a Lye. I never hammered any thing against them, but Truth: a Goldsmith is a Smith, but a Gold-smith. I wonder not now, that they are so debauched in their Monasteries, and that their old Monks talke of the evils they committed in their youths, with such high merriment and complacence: for cruelty supposeth many great sins, hath many foul enormities that forerun it. They now act upon the very Life-blood of me. Nothing more puts me upon the rack, than that I suffer all this from the immediate hand of a walking Pedlars Pack, a Periwig'd people; a Nation of Anticks; a people terrible to none but to one another, <pb n="39" xml:id="ep000494-022-b"/>as fearing amongst themselves <hi>Morbum Gallicum</hi>, the French Pox; exuberant in their outward and croutching Spaniel Complements, but wretchedly destitute of all truly-gentile and solid civility; A barbarous extract of <hi>Gauls, Huns, Goths, Vandals, Longobards</hi>; Men that have alwayes their Master the Devil in their mouths; quick to strike and kill, but slow to do it nobly.

In this Epistle there is a Latin Hymn: My fancy sings it oftentimes to me. I wish for symmetry-sake, and because it contains my sad story, that some propitious and unseen mouth might sing it, reprive and act the part of my fancy, whilest I intend a little to slumbering. </p>

              <p>Precisely and nakedly, for the speaking of naked Truth: There is an Italian Bishop here in Paris, a man of sublime power, but of a leaden heart: He privately professes against the Immortality of the soul; and uses, against all the Sallies of Nature, a Boy every night, (such is the vile extravagancy of our Nation.) This I spake into the open aire: And though the Truth of it is as well and throughly known to me, as that I walke and talke, yea, although they thought so worthily of me here, as to send me their Embassadour to Naples, yet they imprison'd me. The grand affair of your Countrey is setled <hi>en su ser y puesto</hi>, (I doubt not but you understand Spanish;) or you had been sent to the Inquisition, and your body had made a Bone-fire there: I am a Roman born, and know the manner of it; your Ashes should have been thrown into the River Tiber, to feed the Water-snakes. But your enemies here, were big with hopes, that the Dungeon would have murder'd you. Your own Countrey Monks were your Hangmen; we know all here. </p>

I fancied, that as Stars which have the least Circuit, are nearest the Pole; so men who are least perplexed with businesse, are nearest to Heaven, because we cannot remove a thing from earth, but we must exalt it nearer to Heaven. </p>

              <p>You have been much entangled in the love of them: but as businesses commonly move now, it is a putrified course of life in many parts, and respects. A corrupted Monk is like the reflexion of the great Angel-Image from a Steeple-top in Millan, which at one stroke, limb'd it self on the Clouds in the Air, of themselves prepar'd for such an impression, and only amazed and amuzed the vulgar heads, who vainly took the vain reflexion of an Image on the Clouds, for a most heavenly Saint or Angel. But when the Monks come down out of the Clouds, we know them better, because they are near to us: we never find abroad, men so passionate, so profane: besides that they are commonly drunken Beasts, and lazy lousie belly-gods; these their mysteries I inwardly know: in many Monasteries they study Magical and Demoniacal Arts; they learn the Art of compounding Philters, and thereby draw Nobles to love them above their own children; they compose poisons of all sorts; they destroyed Henry the seventh, Emperour, with a subtle and most sacrilegious poison in a Church, and your King John in a Monastery; the Monk is the Jesuit's great Grandfather; the Monks coin false money; they falsifie stones of middle rank into Pearls, and Jewels; by the transmutation of Mettals, they raise them into a kind of counterfeit silver. </p>

Trithemius, a famous Abbot, shewed Maximilian the Emperour his wife, even long after her death, and <foreign xml:lang="lat">Verrucam in collo ejus</foreign>, the very Wart in her neck, by which the Emperour particularly knew her. I could recount a hundred of these: There was a kind of mortal punishment amongst the old Jews, badg'd with the title of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Combustio anima</foreign>, the burning of the soul, wherein they powred scalding Lead into the mouth of the condemned person, by the which his inwards were consumed, the shape and outward bark of his body, remaining still with due proportion. The body of the Monk is extant still, his soul is burnt forth: Trithemius satisfied royal curiosity, and I have complied with yours. I am a child of Rome both in birth and belief; but abuses are now grown into a wilde Forrest, and men are become as the wilde Beasts. It hath oftentimes pleaded against me in my heart, Are there no true worshippers in all the world, but the three wickedest Nations of all the world?

              <p>I am restor'd hither from Paris. And though the Jesuits, Jesuitically call me the Benedictines Carrier; because I convey Boyes and Maids out of England to holy places, that is, Monasteries and Nunneries, yet in truth I am an honourable Procuratour for the Benedictines. I have put on my habit here, that I might appear the more venerable to this Knight, whose vast Estate we sit brooding upon, that we may bring it into the light ours. The Writings are here drawn, and he is answerable to us, by the procuration of this good Boy, both in Religion, and all our other Desires. We intend him for one of our Monasteries abroad: that he, like the Eagle hovering over the Emperour's Corps, yeelded up and exposed to the funeral Flames, may be elevated from the Earth towards Heaven, while his Estate perishes from him under him. It will suit more analogically, according to Logick with us, than with him. Our Vocation is more high, our lives are more holy, our Persons are sacred. Besides, we have reform'd his Soul; for the which, his Estate, though great, is but a small paiment: If he were able to exonerate both the Indies into our laps, he could not require us worthily. Our Abby of Lambspring we subtilly recover'd from the Lutherans: we fool'd a doting old Abbot with false Alarums out of England, till he invested us in our Colledge at Doway: Our Parisian House we purchas'd by setting a Death's-Head, or the Head of a carrion Calf, upon a <pb n="47" xml:id="ep000494-026-b"/>Man's Body: Our House at Dulewort we bought with a portion of a Ghost-led Maid, who now lives neer us there, afflictedly upon our alms, and repents of her mistaken Charity. Our Priory at St Malloes came feather'd by a French Merchant, whom we piously inveigled to his undoing, and afterwards inserted, though aforreign Plant, into our holy Congregation. And if this fair Estate be added upon a particular and enclosed account, it will nobly support us in England: and we shall be congenerous and homogeneous (I never went beyond Logick) with our selves. <stage xml:id="ep000494-e26120">He wakes. </stage>

              <p>Delicious London, once more I <pb n="48" xml:id="ep000494-027-a"/>salute thee. Thy buildings are now glorionsly beautifull, if my eyes may sentence for thee. Here dwels Simplicity, here Justice is enthron'd. O People of England, learn your own Happinesse, your earthly Happinesse drops and distils from your own hands. Be obedient, and conform to the good and easie Laws here; and you comprize more than the Happinesse of all the other Fortunate Ilands; Arabia the Happy is not so happy, and fragrant as your Countrey. Knew ye the slavish condition of France, the beggery of Spain, the buggery of <hi>Italy, Spain</hi>, and France, the general wickedness of all the world, ye would quietly sit down, every one at his own Door, and calmly say, Heaven be blessed that I was born in little England. Here all Persons are free, breathe freely, eat comfortably, use freely and fully their own. Where is it so besides here? Now ye are in joynt again, stand Atlas-firm, bear up your little Heaven of quiet here: or as ye are now the most happy, ye will be otherwise the most despicable and most unhappy of all Nations. The natural desire a man has of self-preservation, like adverse Wind and Tyde, lately cast me back into France, and the English Monks there, the sordid idle Monks, more than impal'd me in the Bastille, because I threatned to impound them here, as detaining from me a fair Sum of my own Monys most due to me. And to guild, to varnish, to burnish this their unhew'd, ragged, and ragged Action, they plyde my story with lies of Defence, lies of Offence, lies with heads, but not with feet, lies with feet, but not with heads; lies with neither head nor foot; lies whisper'd, and loud lies. Oye Scholars of our most renowned Universities, set bounds to your feet, and limits to your Thoughts: I was my Fathers eldest Son, and Heir to a comfortable Estate of Houses and Lands; and I threw all behinde me, to be cheated, most religiously cheated by secular Priests, Jesuites, Monks, Friers; but amongst all these godly Cheaters, the Monk is the Grandee, the <foreign xml:lang="lat">Pontifex maximus</foreign>, the first and Universal Bishop. Two years he held me now fast in Prison, in a loathed Prison: and after the Business was made publick here by my private Letters, clear'd me of the Prison, but unwillingly, but conditionally that I should be confin'd there all my life: I consented in the lip: Afterwards pleading that my Body was greatly disorder'd in respect of health, desir'd a few dayes wherein to physick it (I meant with a better Air;) and in that little Tract of Time wherein it was supposed I took Physick, hasted privately to Diep, a Port-Town in France, where I found sixteen English Monks attending the Passage-Boat: they prevented my Passage with them, and posted away Letters to Paris, solliciting that I should be stopt; but the Hugonots of Diep past me over the night following. In all their Houses in those transmarine parts, there are none left but boyes and old Men; hither they are all come. The greatest Crocodile was at first harbour'd in an Egge, which is <foreign xml:lang="lat">Paulò majus anserino</foreign>, a little bigger than a Goose-egg. And yet, the Crocodile is a Devourer of Men: and when, being horrour-struck, these cannot weep for themselves, mockingly weeps over them; grows huge, and on to the last period of life; and is different, not a little from the Goose, in shape, substance, colour, manners; though they favour one another in the Egg. No sensual Creature spreads to so vast a bigness, from so small beginnings, as this Egg-Crocodile. In <pb n="49" xml:id="ep000494-027-b"/>two years I had not the benefit of a fresh Shirt. I had preserv'd some rich Goods from the ravenous Officers who took me: And <hi>John Baptista Palliot</hi>, the President of Noury in France, my fellow-prisoner, who desired and undertook to secure them for me at his own house, secur'd them there indeed, but from me, and for himself, he, being in account a person of Honour, and I indeed a wrongfully and poor imprison'd stranger. Another French Prisoner wearied me oftentimes, with desiring me that he might use my body Sodomitically. The Frenchmen say: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Omnis Jesuita aut Magus aut Sodomita, </foreign>Every Jesuite is a Magitian or a Sodomite: This I know not; the other, experience brought home to me. Upon composed and most deliberate thoughts, I set up this resolution like a Colossus: I will yield up my life on a Gallows here, before I will set my foot again where proud Rome does Mistris it: because her Vassals are more than heathenishly cruel, more unclean than Turks and Indians. London, I joyfully kiss thy ground, which others kick and tread upon: allow me a Grave here: Thy air seems to me perfum'd: and I am now, as it were, born again. </p>

              <p>Madam, I perceive that our breeding hath incircled us in a like proportion of knowledg. The soul it self is changed from without by the presentation of external and occasional Objects; and from within by the Passions, and is driven every way by them, as the Waves by the Winds; indeed, primordially and principally by love, the Amazon-Queen of the Passions; afterwards by her Bride-maids, Desire and Hope; yea, by Anger Love's-Champion. And then the changes are good or evill, as the objects are evil or good, concerning which these Passions are excited; and as the carriage of the Passions in their tendencies, is ordinate, (managed by a prudent and pious Ordination) or disordinate: The Sea breaking its bounds, is boundless in mischief. To wade nearer our affair: The best change of the soul, answerable to man as a reasonable creature, and within the Dominions of nature; is, when the moral vertues in it, are directed and guided by Prudence, and every Action tutour'd by some vertue, because the Passions are obedient to reason. Nature is higher perfected by degrees: but of that I will speak in the Nunnery. </p>

              <p>I have seen a Sight here, perhaps not unusual, yet strange to me: a Mountebank in this blind and uncouth part of the Suburbs, upon a common Stall. I took him for a Ballad-singer, till I came neer him: but finding him afterwards to be a Mountebank, I waited upon the sequel. He had his paints, his white and red for women; his powders of all colours; his perfumes, mixt and simple; his salves for all fores and griefs; he could abate the Drunkards rednesse, and fire in his face, and raise a pale colour to beauty, from within: he could awake Appetite, set a man to sleep, byasse nature as he pleas'd: He could furnish a man or woman with new teeth, new eyes, new ears, new noses, new arms, new legs: I expected when he would have said, new Heads, new Hearts. If my Ears scout it rightly for my Soul, I heard him say, that he could restore a lost Maiden-head. He spake contemptibly of drinking poisons: that, said he, the common Rabble and Rubbish of Mountebanks, the vile Offal of Quacksalvers can do. He suppled us with a Story of one Barthochabas an Author of Sedition amongst the old Jews, who so medicin'd his mouth, and manag'd a device in it, that he seem'd to vomit fire; and he profes't upon the Reputation of a Gentleman, that he had the Receipt: He put on with another Example of a man at Millan an Italian City, who washed his face and hands with scalding lead, as carelesly and as confidently, as a man washeth his hands and face with ordinary water; having first washed them with an extraordinary, new-found, and hardening water of his own: And of this water he protested as he was an Artist, he had a great Quantity. We had from him a whole fardle of such stuff. To all People that bought of his Trash to the value of Twelve-pence, he gave a printed Bill, designing the Place where he lies, and the manifold motions and out-walkings of his skill. I stood in the crowd while he staid upon the Stall; and when he came down and leyel'd himself with the People, I observ'd that speaking with several Persons, he did insinuate these or the like words; All men have a natural care of their Bodies, but who regards his own Soul? If a simple Asse fals in the streets, many wise men run to lift the simple Asse up; but if a Man's Heart or Soul lies wallowing in the dirt, such a Soul or Heart is not regarded; pray, come to my lodging: these words had their mysterious aim. Now this metaphysical Doctor, this all-able Mountebank with all his packs, and his knacks, is the Benedictine-Jesuite, whom I have us'd, and by whom I have been manifoldly abus'd. As I take it, he takes this way. The Bastille has chang'd me, and I believe he knows me not. I'le tosse a word or two with him as he passes. </p>

The Spaniards wittily, and with a Sarcasm call the Jesuits, <hi>Los teatinos, y los Padres Teatinos, </hi>the Teatines, and the Teatine Fathers; from this Account: A Spanish Painter being scandal-struck by the Covetousness of the Jesuits, drew a Picture after this manner: He hung in the uppermost Part of his Table, a vast Purse of Money: He set round about it, in the lower parts; one of every sort of Mendicant Friers; who looked upwards willingly, yea devoutly upon it, but durst not touch it, as being forbidden by the Rules of their several Orders: He painted a Jesuite in some distance, armed with a Bow and Arrows, and looking over (and indeed over-reaching) the poor Mendicants: For, he held up his Bow, and had let his Arrow flie, which had struck the Mark (the Purse) and now stuck in it; he still keeping a fierce and eager eye upon the Mark: And the Painter had learnedly derived these Latin words from his mouth, hanging, as if the cold Air had frozen them into a Record, <hi>To attingo</hi>, ô Purse, I reach thee, I hit thee, I have thee: whence the Spaniards, being edified by the devotion of the Painter, and the holiness of the Picture, presently call'd the Jesuits, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Los Teatinos</foreign>, the Spanish word coming up as neerly as it may, to the Latine, from which the Spanish Language hath deviated: But the Painter had excellently compleated his Piece, had he pictured our modern English Monk catching away the Purse, for which all the others gap'd, and which the Jesuite thought he had heart-struck. </p>

I confess to you, as to a Friend, prompted by the Bird of good Omen within me, that I and my Brother there, have been eatechiz'd at Rome, and that we are Benedictine Priests. Sir, our Order is the most ancient, and most holy of all others: the Devil is troubled that we are station'd so neer him: If you were here alone, the Devil would lie down, leave barking, and be quiet as a Lamb, because you are yet abstracted from the lines of Communication with us. </p>

              <p>I am as much Priest as they; for Priesthood cannot be lost, but they are ignorant of it, because they have lost my face out of their remembrance. In good time, Sir. But under favour, I have read in your Authors, that the occasion other Orders rose, was, because the Monks were defective in that part, which the new rising Order most profest: as that the Dominicans rose, because the Monks were Kitchin-bound, and their mouths were stop'd, they became dumb and muzzl'd in publick; good men, they dealt out their time in eating, hunting both Hare and Fox, and purging their reins according to lease: The Franciscans came, because the Monks were proud; and the Bernardines for the same reason, because the Monks were fat and stately: the Jesuites came shoving in at last, because the Monks had long desisted from the teaching of Children, and thereby ingaging rich Parents, and from the recovering of Nations, and thereby obliging the most rich Parent of all at Rome: and so in others. Whom did, or do the Jesuites and they love, but in order to their own ends, and for gain-sake? Who have been more scandalous in all the wandrings of wickedness, than the Monks with their poatch'd Eyes in their Meditations? The worst of Geneva-Jesuites might better and more justly be canoniz'd after the Age is pass'd wherin he liv'd, than the best of Monks in these parts. And I have read in a learned Monk, that as Rivers after long running run slender and muddy, so the best things gather dust, and contract corruption in length of Time. Your <foreign xml:lang="lat">Pontifices maximi</foreign>, grand Fathers at Rome, have commonly most excellent Resolutions and Actions at their first entrance into their Irish-wooden Chair; but they soon Reed-like hold down their Heads: The Italians jest it <pb n="62" xml:id="ep000494-034-a"/>notably, though profanely.
