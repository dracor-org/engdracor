            <p>I am in doubt, and I thinke cannot easily be resolved, whether it were better living in Hell, where there is no day; or at my Masters, where there is no night: I cannot tell what any yong Gentlewoman would answer to the blind Philosophers question. I am sure to me, Nulla videtur voluptas nocturna: There cannot the least sleepe harbour under my browes, but it is presently started with the loud cryes of my Master. Melancholy keeps him alwayes waking, and his envy will not suffer me to take any rest: Then my head hath scarce forgot my pillow, when his buzzing Suitors swarming about me, sting my eares like Hornets: like ghosts on this side Cocytus, they flock thither in infinite multitudes, to be wafted over to Hell: I would they were all once shipt thither, and dispatched; they are so importunate, that I could curse Nature who hath given me two eares to heare them, and but one tongue (though that indifferent double) to answer them. But at length I bethought me, she hath given me two leggs to convey me from them. </p>

            <p>I Would the number of things in the world had been lesse, or the names more, I might not have beene thus troubled. There is nothing spoken or written but is subject to so many interpretations, that without Distinction, giveth occasion of an hundred evasions. An Obligation cannot be made for tenne Groats, but the Attourney will have halfe a Crowne for Parchment: no lesse will hold the Addition of the parties names, of younger and elder, Butcher and Tanner of Witam and Wolvercoate; that if the unskilfull Painter was faine to write under his well resembled Pictures, this is a Dogge, this is an Hare, I had need to come after and tell what Dogge, what Hare he meaneth. But yesterday an Herauld was with me, who, as I lov'd to save blood-shed, intreated me to helpe him to pacifie two incensed Citizens, who since the yeare 1610, when all Artificers and Tradesmen became Gentlemen, fortuned to light both upon the same Coate-armour, and now were ready to fight, who should have it most proper, if I lent him not some difference to put betwixt them: I asking what the Coate was, he told me a Bulls head, whereupon I advised him to call his, that was the yonger, an Oxe-head, and make the hornes a little longer; and I hope by this they are contented. And indeed I cannot wonder that so often many things have but one name, when sometimes one thing engrosseth many names, like the Spanish Nobility, which require whole sheets for a Superscription. You may enquire for a Broker, meete with a Bawd, and fall into the hands of an Vsurer, yet all but one Citizen. You may there see a Scholler troubled with the Rheume, a Gentleman ill at ease, a Servingman starke drunke, all sicke of one disease; I would some <pb xml:id="eng000257-011-a"/>would reduce these things to a parity, and relieve the nullity of some by the plurality of others; or some good Cyrus would adventure a jerking, by taking away from short things those Titles which are too long for them, and giving to those who are too short, and so fit them both. If Division would come once, I would speake to him my selfe, to make a more equall distribution; and I wonder hee staies so long; but now heere hee comes with the rest. </p>
