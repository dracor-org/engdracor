Then to the charge of a faithful friend we gave our children, who were so young they knew not themselves what they were, with a command to breed 'em fit to be Princes; but neither to the world nor themselves discover that they were so. Long this fault lay not hid, for the abus'd Oracle unask'd complains, and to the incensed people tells our falshood; by them we were banish'd, never to return till we had found our <pb n="73" xml:id="eng000384-321-b"/>Sons, which was some mercy; but alas!
