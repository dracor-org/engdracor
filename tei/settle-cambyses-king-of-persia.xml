        <head>TO THE Most Excellent, and most Illustrious PRINCESS, ANNE, Dutchess OF BUCCLUGH &amp; MONMOUTH: Wife to the most Illustrious, and High-born Prince, IAMES, Duke of MONMOUTH. </head>

        <p>SInce the great Characters, and Subjects of serious Plays, are representations of the past Glories of the World, the arrogance of an Epistle Dedicatory may pretend to some Iustice, in offering the Heroick Stories of past Ages to their Hands, who are the Ornaments of <pb xml:id="ep000710-003-a"/>the present.— Once Persia was the Mistress of the Earth, the Royal Seat of the Monarchs of the Universe. Then, as that God, the Sun▪ which they ador'd, lends his kind ' Rays to all lesser lights; so all the Tributary Glories of Inferiour Princes shin'd by reflection from the Persian Crown. But now that Sovereignty must cease, and the Eastern Monarch Cambyses can pretend to no greatness of his own, but comes to borrow Glories from the Western World, in seeking a Patronage from your favourable goodness. The same Cambyses whom History has represented to be●● Blasphemer of the gods, a Prophaner of Religion, and a Defacer of Temples, is by your power become a Convert, and humbly payes his Devotion to that Divinity, to whose protection he commit● himself and Fortune.— But whilst I thus boldly proceed to Dedicate this trifle to your Grace, forget to ask pardon for the meaness of the Offering, and the confidence of him that offers it; Crime unpardonable, were not your Mercy as signal as your other Virtues: For when kind Heaven honours the World with some Worthy and Illustrious Person, in which Rank your Grace mus●● claim an eminent place; who, besides your late <pb xml:id="ep000710-003-b"/>Affinity, are Allied to that Royal Race, to which England owes its three last Monarchs; Heaven, I say, besides the Great Souls, High Spirits, and Noble Thoughts it lends such Persons, endues them too with more Familiar Virtues; as Courtesy, Generosity, and a Condescension to entertain the Addresses of Inferiour Mankind, and to smile on the Endeavours of the meanest of their Subjects, and Admirers. Else they would be forced, like Planets, to move in a Sphear alone; and Greatest Monarchs, should they admit of none below them, would make their Palaces but solitary Prisons. The assurance therefore of these Virtues, which particularly possess so large a seat in your Heroick, Breast, animate me to present this Poem to your Hands, that it may take Sanctuary there, where in its Infancy it received protection. As he that's born under some happy Planet, owes the success of his whole Life to the Predominance of that kinder Star that ruled at his Nativity. The Entertainment you gave it in loose sheets, when it first saw light, encourages me to this presumption, now in its riper growth, to devote it wholly to your Self, and under that Title to stile it happy: Since thus Guarded, I dare expose it to the World; <pb xml:id="ep000710-004-a"/>and stand in less awe of Censures, when your Influence protects it, For, as that timerous Pilot, in a Storm, was Condemn'd for fearing Shipwrac●● when his Vessel carried Caesar; this Poem can fear no dangers when it carries your Name for it Defence. But besides the fortunate and glorio● Advantages this Piece may justly challenge from the Favour of so Indulgent a Patroness, it entitles 〈◊〉 to this happiness, the opportunity this Dedication gives me, of writing my self, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WIth no small pains our Author has this day </l>
        <l>Brought on the Stage a damn'd dull serious play. </l>
        <l>But what the Devil is he like to gain? </l>
        <l>If Wits, like States, with a joynt pow'r might Reign, </l>
        <l>A Poet's labour then were worth the while, </l>
        <l>Could he plead Custom, and demand your smile. </l>
        <l>But that was ne're in fashion. Poets ought </l>
        <l>To write with the same Spirit Caesar fought: </l>
        <l>Indiff'rent Writers are contemn'd, for now </l>
        <l>There grow no Lawrels for a common brow: </l>
        <l>None but great <hi>Ben, Shakespear</hi>, or whom this Age </l>
        <l>Has made their Heirs, succeed now on the Stage. </l>
        <l>As Eagles trye their Young against the Sun; </l>
        <l>The self-same hazard all Young Writers run: </l>
        <l>They are accounted a false bastard Race </l>
        <l>That are not able to look Wit i'th' Face; </l>
        <l>And therefore must expect an equal Fate, </l>
        <l>To be disown'd as illegitimate: </l>
        <l>Thus conscious of their weaknesses and wants, </l>
        <l>They know their doom; as deserts to young Plants, </l>
        <l>You no more Mercy to Young writers show, </l>
        <l>You damn and blast'em e're they've time to grow. </l>
        <l>Thus you have learnt the Turkish Cruelty, </l>
        <l>When Elder Brothers Reign, the Younger dye. </l>
        <l>But as those Turks, when they're for Death design'd, </l>
        <l>This favour from their Cruel Brothers find, </l>
        <l>Strangled by Mutes, who fitted for the Fact, </l>
        <l>Want Tongues to speak the Cruelty they Act. </l>
        <l>Knowing the dangers of a publick shame, </l>
        <l>Our Rhimer hopes his Fate may be the same: </l>
        <l>He humbly legs, if you must cruel be, </l>
        <l>You'd make no noise when you his doom decree, </l>
        <l>But if you damn him, damn him silently. </l>
