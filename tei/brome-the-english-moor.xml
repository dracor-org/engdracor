        <head>TO THE READERS. </head>
        <p>Or rather to the Spectators, if the Fates so pleas'd, these Comedies exactly being dressed for the Stage; and the often-tried Author (better than many who can but scribble) understood the Proportions and Beauties of a Scene; But as they are they will not deceive you; for the same hand (which formerly pleas'd) now held the Pen. We suppose we bring what in these dayes you scarce could hope for, Five <pb xml:id="A77567-004-a"/>new Playes We call them new, because till now they never were printed. You must not think them posthumous Productions, though they come into the world after the Author's death: they were all begotten and born (and own'd by Him before a thousand witnesses) many years since; they then trod the Stage (their proper place) though they pass'd not the Press. They are all Comedies, for (a man would think) we have had too many Tragedies. But this Book knew them not. The ENGLISH MOOR here( what ever name or face it wears) is older than our Troubles. The LOVE-SICK COURT, and the AMBITIOUS POLITICK are but one Play, though strange those two should dwell together. This NEW ACADEMY concerns not that which eight years since peep'd up in Write Friers; and this NEW EXCHANGE knows nothing <pb xml:id="A77567-004-b"/>of that which now is cleaving to the Great Church Wall. This QUEEN is a meer stranger to our Island; Her Scene is Sicily, the Persons and Action taste nothing of England. Thus the whole Book being free and ingenuous, we hope the Author may have the same allowance, especially now since he's gone to the great Wits, that is, dead. And yet there are a sort (one would wonder there should be) who think they lessen this Author's worth when they speak the relation he had to Ben Johnson. We very thankfully embrace the Objection, and desire they would name any other Master that could better teach a man to write a good Play. The materials must flow from all parts of the world; but the Art and Composition come onely from Books and such living Masters as that our great Laureat; And for this purpose we have here prefixt Ben Johnson's own <pb xml:id="A77567-005-a"/>testimony to his Servant our Author; we grant it is (according to Ben's own nature and custome) magisterial enough; and who looks for other, since he said to Shakespear— I shall draw envy on thy name (by writing in his praise) and threw in his face— small Latine and less Greek; but also told Selden himself (as if Ben's conscience checked him for being too good natured in commending others.) </p>
        <quote>
          <l>Your Book (my Selden) I have read— </l>
          <l>Though I confess (as every Muse hath err'd, </l>
          <l>And mine not least) I have too oft preferr'd </l>
          <l>Men past their terms, and prais'd some names too much, </l>
          <l>But twas with purpose to have made them such; </l>
          <l>Since, being deceiv'd, I turn a sharper eye </l>
          <l>Upon my self, and ask to whom, and why, </l>
          <l>And what I write, and vex it many dayes </l>
          <l>Before men get a Verse, much less a Praise. </l>
          <pb xml:id="A77567-005-b"/>
          <l>— I first salute thee so, and gratulats, </l>
          <l>With that thy style, thy keeping of thy state. </l>
          <l>— I could take up (and nere abuse </l>
          <l>The credit) what would furnish a tenth Muse: </l>
          <l>But here's nor time nor place my wealth to tell; </l>
          <l>You both are modest, so am I. Farewel. </l>
        </quote>
        <p>It seems( what ere we think) Ben thought it diminution for no man to attend upon his Muse. And were not already the Antients too much trod on, we could name famous wits who served far meaner Masters than Ben Johnson. For, none vers'd in Letters but know the wise Aesop was born and bred a wretched slave; Lucian a Stone-cutter, Virgil himself begotten by a Basket-maker, born in a ditch, and then preferred to an under Groom in the stable; nay, (to instance in our Authors own order) Naevius the Comedian a Captains mans man; Plautus <pb xml:id="A77567-006-a"/>servant to a poor Baker, Terence a slave as well as Aesop; and (which for our purpose is most of all) our Authors own Master handled the Trowel before he grew acquainted with Seianus or Cataline. But enough of this, lest pleading for the Author, make him seem to want an Apology. As for the Stationers, they bring these Poems as they had them from the Author; not suffering any false or busy hand to adde or make the least mutilation; having been more watchful over the Printers common negligence, than such work as this hath usually obtained. And if these new Playes fail your expectation, we openly profess we know not how, where, or when we shall fit you. </p>

        <head>To my most ingenious friend, Mr. ALEX. BROME Upon his setting forth Mr. RICH. BROMES PLAYES: </head>
        <l>THis, Sir, is double Piety, and you </l>
        <l>In this oblige the dead and living too. </l>
        <l>As the last trumpet with one pow'rful sound </l>
        <l>Raises forgotten Bodies from the ground, </l>
        <l>And betters those that yet remain alive: </l>
        <l>So you an equal happiness do give </l>
        <l>Unto his dust, and us, at once engage </l>
        <l>His sacred Ashes, and the present age. </l>
        <l>Nor can I tell to whom we more are bound, </l>
        <l>Or to his wit, or you that have it found. </l>
        <l>When Thetis Son amongst the maids lay hid, </l>
        <l>And for their softer wars the Trojan fled; </l>
        <pb xml:id="A77567-008-a"/>
        <l>He that discover'd him, did justly claim </l>
        <l>An equal share in th' honour of his name; </l>
        <l>And dared to call Achilles victories, </l>
        <l>All those exploits, and all those Trophies his: </l>
        <l>So you that have this noble wit reveal'd </l>
        <l>And made it be (which was before conceal'd) </l>
        <l>Known and commended, may as well receive </l>
        <l>Part in those Lawrels we to him do give. </l>
        <l>He made the oyl, but you enlightned it, </l>
        <l>He gave the salt, but you have made it white, </l>
        <l>And dug it from the Pit where it once lay </l>
        <l>Unseen, or by the eyes of men or day: </l>
        <l>He made the branches of this Coral grow, </l>
        <l>Hid in its private Sea untouch'd; but you </l>
        <l>By drawing it into the open air, </l>
        <l>Have made it turn more pretious, and more fair. </l>
        <l>He spake with such a full and easie strain, </l>
        <l>With such a soft, and such a flowing vein, </l>
        <l>As if 'twere Nature all, yet there was Art, </l>
        <l>Yet there was Skill in every limb and Part. </l>
        <l>So gently came all that he thought or writ, </l>
        <l>As if he made it not, but did repeat. </l>
        <l>His fancy like the blood did alwayes flow, </l>
        <l>Yet full of life and full of spirts too. </l>
        <pb xml:id="A77567-008-b"/>
        <l>His wit and Angels did in this agree, </l>
        <l>Their motion is most nimble, quick, and free, </l>
        <l>And perfect too. And as the world was made, </l>
        <l>(Which no delayes of spring and summer had, </l>
        <l>No ages or increases, but on all </l>
        <l>At first a ripeness, and full growth did fall; </l>
        <l>So all that from his happy Pen did come </l>
        <l>Was ripe and grown at first, and left no room </l>
        <l>For after change, no second hand could give </l>
        <l>More strength to it, or it more strength receive. </l>
        <l>When he doth speak of love, himself he arms </l>
        <l>With such resistless, and such conquering charms, </l>
        <l>Acts such sweet hopes, such innocent fears, and joyes, </l>
        <l>That we or love his Mistress, or his voice, </l>
        <l>As eccho did. When he would make us smile, </l>
        <l>Thousand Anacreons play about his style. </l>
        <l>When he commands our sorrow, straight our eyes </l>
        <l>Into salt streams, our hearts to sighings rise. </l>
        <l>When he doth laugh again, the clouds are gone, </l>
        <pb xml:id="A77567-009-a"/>
        <l>Our minds into a sudden calmness run: </l>
        <l>He so dispos'd our thoughts, as when the hand, </l>
        <l>Or eye of the chief Gen'ral doth command, </l>
        <l>Whole Armies act what his example led, </l>
        <l>Follow his postures with such willing speed, </l>
        <l>Into obedience with such easiness fall, </l>
        <l>As if one soul and spring did move them all. </l>
        <l>When he strook vice, he let the person go, </l>
        <l>Wounded not men but manners; nor did do </l>
        <l>Like him who when he painted heaven &amp; hel, </l>
        <l>Amongst the damned shades and those that fell, </l>
        <l>Did draw his Enemies face, that all might say </l>
        <l>Who there condemned by the Painter lay: </l>
        <l>But as the Surgeon at once hides and cures, </l>
        <l>And bindeth up the limb which most indures </l>
        <l>The sore and pain: so he with gentle hand </l>
        <l>Did heal the wound, and yet conceal the man. </l>
        <l>His Scenes mens Actions, Tempers, Humours shew, </l>
        <l>And copy out what the great world doth do. </l>
        <l>His words are like the shapes which Angels take, </l>
        <l>And for themselves of finest air do make, </l>
        <l>That are so much like men, that clearest eyes </l>
        <l>Cannot discern where the smal difference lies. </l>

        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <l>MOst noble, fair and curteous, to ye all </l>
        <l>Welcome and thanks we give, that you would call </l>
        <l>And visit your poor servants, that have been </l>
        <l>So long and pitiless unheard, unseen. </l>
        <l>Welcome, you'l say your money that does do, </l>
        <l>(Dissembling is a fault) we say so too. </l>
        <l>And your long absence was no fault of your, </l>
        <l>But our sad fate to be so long obscure. </l>
        <l>Jove and the Muses grant, and all good Men, </l>
        <l>We feel not that extremity again: </l>
        <l>The thought of which yet chills us with a fear </l>
        <l>That we have bought our liberty too dear: </l>
        <l>For should we fall into a new restraint, </l>
        <l>Our hearts must break that did before but faint. </l>
        <l>You noble, great and good ones, that vouchsafe </l>
        <l>To see a Comedy, and sometimes laugh </l>
        <l>Or smile at wit and harmeless mirth, As thus </l>
        <l>ye have begun to grace and succour us; </l>
        <l>Be further pleas'd (to hold us still upright, </l>
        <l>For our relief, and for your own delight) </l>
        <l>To move for us to those high powers whom we </l>
        <l>submit unto in all humility, </l>
        <l>For our proceeding, and we'le make it good </l>
        <l>To utter nothing may be understood </l>
        <l>Offensive to the state, manners or time, </l>
        <l>We will as well look to our necks as climb. </l>
        <l>You hear our sute, obtain it if you may; </l>
        <l>Then find us money and we'le find you play. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>Now let me be a modest undertaker </l>
        <l>For us the players, the play and the play-maker: </l>
        <l>If we have faild in speech or Action, we </l>
        <l>Must crave a pardon; If the Commedy </l>
        <l>Either in mirth, or matter be not right, </l>
        <l>As 'twas intended unto your delight, </l>
        <l>The Poet in hope of favour doth submit </l>
        <l>Unto your censure both himself and it, </l>
        <l>Wishing that as y'are judges in the cause </l>
        <l>You judge but by the antient Comick Lawes. </l>
        <l>Not by their course who in this latter age </l>
        <l>Have sown such pleasing errors on the stage, </l>
        <l>Which he no more will chuse to imitate </l>
        <l>Then they to fly from truth, and run the State. </l>
        <l>But whether I avail, you have seen the play, </l>
        <l>And all that in defence the Poet can say </l>
        <l>Is, that he cannot mend it by a jest </l>
        <l>I'th Epilogue exceeding all the rest; </l>
        <l>To send you off upon a champing bit, </l>
        <l>More then the scenes afforded of his wit: </l>
        <l>Nor studies he the Art to have it said </l>
        <l>He sculks behind the hangings as affraid </l>
        <l>Of a hard censure, or pretend to brag </l>
        <l>Here's all your money again brought in i'th bag </l>
        <l>If you applaud not, when before the word </l>
        <l>'Twas parcel'd out upon the shearing-board. </l>
        <l>Such are fine helps; but are not practised yet </l>
        <l>By our plain Poet who cannot forget </l>
        <l>His wonted modesty, and humble way </l>
        <l>For him and us, and his yet doubtful play, </l>
        <l>Which, if receiv'd or but allow'd by you, </l>
        <l>We and the play are yours, the Poet too. </l>
