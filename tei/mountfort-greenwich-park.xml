        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ALGERNOON <hi>Earl of </hi>ESSEX, Viscount Malden, Baron Capell of Hadham, and Lord Lieutenant of the County of Hartford. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THE General good Character the World gives of your Honour and Virtues, has embolden'd me to beg your Favourable Protection of this Comedy: And though it be a hard matter for so young a Pretender to escape the industrious Ill Nature and Malice of the Town, yet I shall have this satisfaction, that if they'll not allow me a Judge of Poetry, they must of Persons; and they cannot impartially disapprove of my choice in a Patron. </p>
        <p>Indifferent Authors in most Ages have been incourag'd and preserv'd under the Clemency of the Nobility, <pb xml:id="ep000647-003-a"/>in hopes they might be better: But the severity of our Wits would have the first Plays which are now written, equal to the best of <hi>Ben Johnson</hi>, or Shakespear: And yet they do not shew that esteem for their Works which they pretend to, or else are not so good Judges as they would be thought: When we can see the Town throng to a Farce, and Hamlet not bring Charges: But notwithstanding they will be Criticks, and will scarce give a man leave to mend; like the rigid Precepts and manner of the most Famous Master of Westminster: Who, though he has bred the greatest Men of Parts and Learning in this Age; yet I believe, if the Impatience and Spirit of his Knowledge could have submitted to the slower Capacities of his Scholars, he might have made many more. </p>
        <p>Poetry, I must confess, has ever been my Delight, as Honour and Goodness, your Lordships. And the▪ I can never expect to be as perfect in the first, as you are in the last; I am sure of two good supports from such Excellencies; and which your Lordship never omitted expressing to those who have seek'd your Protection. </p>
        <p>Your early Gallantry for the Liberty and Welfare of your Country, in so needful a time (and where <pb xml:id="ep000647-003-b"/>the small number of Volunteers magnifies your Lordships being one) proves the Spirit of your Predecessors is left behind 'em: And though this Nation has heartily mourned the loss of one of 'em; Yet the death of a good Subject, like that of a good King, is best dispens'd with by the Publick, when his Virtues shine in his Offspring. </p>
        <p>I would avoid the Censure of Flattery, and of tyring your Lordship with the Commendations which you justly deserve: but perhaps may not desire. I have only this to say, that it is not to be doubted, but the Spirit which has inspir'd this Noble Undertaking of waiting on your Prince, will merit a Providence to preserve your Person. And as you will be a Credit to his Camp, may you return to be an Ornamemt to his Court. And as you are the Pride of our present young Nobility, may you be a Pattern for the future. Then I shall wish for the fancy of Mr. Cowley, with the Judgment of Mr. Dryden, to express my Sence of your Worth: But in the mean time, I humbly entreat your Lordship would accept of the Hearty well Wishes, and perfect (though distant) Respect </p>

        <lg>
          <l>WIth the sad prospect of a Long Vacation, </l>
          <l>The Fear of War, and Danger of the Nation; </l>
          <l>Hard we have toil'd this Winter for new Plays, </l>
          <l>That we might live in these Tumultuous Days. </l>
          <l>Sad Days for us, when War's lowd Trumpets sound, </l>
          <l>Nothing but Beaux and Parsons will be found: </l>
          <l>Look to't, you Men of Battel, of Renown, </l>
          <l>They'll claw your Ladies off, when you are gone: </l>
          <l>Servants for ●●●●ity. Your Beaux's of Sense: </l>
          <l>Will's Coffee-House is the Office of Intelligence; </l>
          <l>And for the Masks who hunt the smaller Fry, </l>
          <l>Their Chocolet-House will their wants supply: </l>
          <l>Our Play presents you with all sorts of Men, </l>
          <l>From keeping Courtier, to the horn'd Citizen, </l>
          <l>Whose handsome Wife brings in the constant Gain. </l>
          <l>At Greenwich lies the Scene, where many a Lass </l>
          <l>Has bin Green-Gown'd upon the tender Gross. </l>
          <l>If Flamstead's Stars would make a true Report, </l>
          <l>Our City Breed's much mended by the Court: </l>
          <l>What Wagers about Mons were-lately laid? </l>
          <l>Had all that Money to the King been paid, </l>
          <l>It might have sav'd the Tax of each Man's head. </l>
          <l>I heard a Shop-keeper not long since swear, </l>
          <l>If England's old Militia had been there, </l>
          <l>We had spoil'd the Monsieur's Projects for this Year. </l>
          <l>Since they depend so on their own Commanders, </l>
          <l>Why weren't the Royal Regiment sent for Flanders? </l>
          <l>With English hearts of Oak, and Horns well steel'd, </l>
          <l>To Butt the Puny Monsieur from the Field. </l>
          <l>But those who threaten him so much, I fear, </l>
          <l>Were they encampt where any Foe was near, </l>
          <l>Wou'd wish themselves behind their Counters here. </l>

        <head>Epilogue. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>WEll, Sirs, is't Peace or War, that you declare? </l>
          <l>I am ready arm'd, so is my Second here. </l>
          <l>If you're displeas'd with what you've seen to Night; </l>
          <l>Behind <hi>Southampton House </hi>we'll do you right, </l>
          <l>Who is't dares draw 'gainst me and Mrs. Knight? </l>
          <l>Be kind, Gallants, if you can mercy show, </l>
          <l>Press not the Plant which of it self does how. </l>
          <l>Ladies, your Goodness is our best support, </l>
          <l>The Men must like the Play, if you are for't. </l>
          <l>And sure the Vizards will not cry it down, </l>
          <l>Since our Intrigues resemble still their own, </l>
          <l>Here all your Coquet tricks to th' life are shown. </l>
          <l>Will you take us to answer your desires? </l>
          <l>We look like two kind keeping Country Squires. </l>
          <l>You'll say we are Chits, too slight and little made, </l>
          <l>You'l scarce find larger in this Age, I Gad. </l>
          <l>For such a Pigmy-Race are now come up; </l>
          <l>They're but half sprouted, like a second Crop. </l>
          <l>The Fathers Sins are in their Offspring shown, </l>
          <l>And each now Puny Chit's an elder Son. </l>
          <l>Nature disowns the slender half-got Race, </l>
          <l>Every Lath-Carcass, with his small Pigs-face, </l>
          <l>By Art endeavours Nature to out-do, </l>
          <l>And since he can't pass for a Man, 's a Beaux. </l>
          <l>If such as these your favour, Ladies, find, </l>
          <l>To Knight and me, as Pages, pray be kind. </l>

Indeed you are a <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000647-006-a"/>Gentlewoman, and have behav'd your self like one: In less than a fortnight after I married you, you ran away with a Captain of the Guards, and I was forc'd to take you out of his Lodgings with a Messenger; and you have play'd me abundance of pretty tricks since, which my Love and Folly has forgiven: So I have been your Father's Bubble, and your Brother's Cully; the Mark of the City, the Shame of my own Family, and your Cuckold and Conveniency. </p>

            <p>No more than I believe one man is enough for the Women about Town. The vanity that first betray'd 'em, always pursues 'em. Pride makes more Whores than Love. Love ne're made Whores; Conveniency and Lust: Love's pure and chast, the Beauty of the mind, if so allow'd; the Beauty of the mind can ne're abuse the Glory of the Soul: They that can fit contented with their being, will never use base methods to advance it: And I cannot help thinking that she who will be Debauch'd to mend her condition, will afterwards lye with any man that can better it. </p>
