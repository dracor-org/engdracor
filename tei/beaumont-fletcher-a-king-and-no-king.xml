Before I went to the warres, I came to the Towne a young fellow without meanes, or parts, to deserue friends; and my emptie guts perswaded me to lie, and abuse people for my meate, which I did, and they beate me: then would I fast two dayes, till my hunger cride out on me, raile still; then me thought I had a monstrous stomacke to abuse them againe, and did it. In this state I continued till they hung me vp by th'heeles and beate me with hasle sticks, as if they would haue baked mee, and haue cosen'd some bodie with mee for Venison: After this I rail'd, and sate quietlie: for the whole Kingdome tooke notice of me for a baffel'd whipt fellow, and what I said, was remembred in mirth, but neuer in anger; of which I was glad, <pb n="42" xml:id="ep000127-023-a"/>I would it were at that passe againe: After this, God cald an Ant of mine, that left two hundred pounds in a Cosens hand for me, who taking me to be a gallant young spirit, rais'd a company for mee with the money, and sent me into Armenia with vm: Away I would haue runne from them, but that I could get no company, and alone I durst not run. I was neuer at battle but once, and there I was running, but Mardonius cudgel'd me; yet I got loose at last, but was so afraid, that I saw no more then my shoulders doe, but fled with my whole company amongst my enemies, and ouerthrew vm: Now the report of my valor is come ouer before mee, and they say I was a raw young fellow, but now I am improu'd. A plague of their eloquence, twill cost me many a beating: And Mardonius might helpe this to if he would; for now they thinke to get honour of me, and all the men I haue abus'd, call me freshly to account, worthily as they call it, by the way of challenge. </p>

I doe find euidently that there is some one Scriuener in this Towne, that has a great hand in writing of challenges, for they are all of a cut, and six of vm in a hand; and they all end, my reputation is deare to me, and I must require satisfaction: whos's there? more paper I hope; no, tis my Lord Bacurius, I feare all is not well betwixt vs. </p>

For after this it will bee great iniustice in you to punish any offendor for any crime: For my selfe I find my heart too bigge, I feele I haue not patience to looke on whilst you runne these forbidden courses: Meanes I haue none but your Fauour, and I am rather glad, that I shall loose vm both together, then keepe vm with such conditions, I shall find a dwelling amongst some people, where though our garments perhaps be courser, we shall be richer farre within, and harbor no such vices in vm. God preserue you, and mend you. </p>

            <l>And in mine owne house kept a Funerall, </l>
