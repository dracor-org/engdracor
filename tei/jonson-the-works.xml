          <l>Yes. Since the most censures, beleeues, and saith </l>

          <l>His solid flames, as thine hath here inrold </l>
          <l>In more then golden verse, those better'd spirits; </l>
          <l>So he entreasures Princes cabinets, </l>
          <l>As thy wealth will their wished libraries; </l>
          <l>So, on the throate of the rude sea, he sets </l>

          <l>And through wild desarts, arm'd with wilder beasts, </l>

          <l>Of hyrelings, sworne to find most right, most rude: </l>
          <l>And he, in stormes at sea, doth not endure, </l>
          <l>Nor in vast desarts, amongst wolues, more danger; </l>

          <l>And as a little brooke creepes from his spring, </l>
          <l>With shallow tremblings, through the lowest vales, </l>

          <l>Least prophane sect should wrong it, and rude gales; </l>
          <l>But finding happy channels, and supplyes </l>
          <l>Of other foords mixe with his modest course, </l>
          <l>He growes a goodly riuer, and descryes </l>
          <l>The strength, that man'd him, since he left his source; </l>
          <l>Then takes he in delight some meades, and groues, </l>
          <l>And, with his two-edg'd waters, flourishes </l>
          <l>Before great palaces, and all mens loues </l>
          <l>Build by his shores, to greet his passages: </l>
          <l>So thy chaste Muse, by vertuous selfe-mistrust, </l>
          <l>Which is a true marke of the truest merit; </l>
          <l>In virgin feare of mens illiterate lust, </l>

          <l>And in the highest pitch of tragoedie, </l>
          <l>Mak'st her command, all things thy ground produces. </l>

            <p>
              <hi>MY LORD</hi>. While you cannot change your merit, I dare not change your title: It was that made it, and not I. Vnder which name, I here offer to your Lo: the ripest of my studies, my Epigrammes; which, though they carry danger in the sound, doe not therefore seeke your shelter: For, when I made them, I had nothing in my conscience, to expressing of which I did need a cypher. But, if I be falne into those times, wherein, for the likenesse of vice, and facts, euery one thinks anothers ill deeds obiected to him; and that in their ignorant and guiltie mouthes, the common voyce is (for their securitie) <hi>Beware the Poet</hi>, confessing, therein, so much loue to their diseases, as they would rather make a partie for them, then be either rid, or told of them: I must expect, at your Lo: hand, the protection of truth, and <pb n="768" xml:id="ep000090-410-a"/>libertie, while you are constant to your owne goodnesse. In thankes whereof, I returne you the honor of leading forth so many good, and great names (as my verses mention on the better part) to their remembrance with posteritie. Amongst whom, if I haue praysed, vnfortunately, any one, that doth not deserue; or, if all answere not, in all numbers, the pictures I haue made of them: I hope it will be forgiuen me, that they are no ill pieces, though they be not like the persons. But I foresee a neerer fate to my booke, then this: that the vices therein will be own'd before the vertues (though, there, I haue auoyded all particulars, as I haue done names) and that some will be so readie to discredit me, as they will haue the impudence to belye themselues. For, if I meant them not, it is so. Nor, can I hope otherwise. For, why should they remit any thing of their riot, their pride, their selfe-loue, and other inherent graces, to consider truth or vertue; but, with the trade of the world, lend their long eares against men they loue not: and hold their deare Mountebanke, or Iester, in farre better condition, then all the studie, or studiers of humanitie? For such, I would rather know them by their visards, still, then they should publish their faces, at their perill, in my Theater, where CATO, if he liu'd, might enter without scandall. </p>

              <l>Of touch, or marble; nor canst boast a row </l>

              <l>Thou hast no lantherne, whereof tales are told; </l>
              <l>Or stayre, or courts; but stand'st an ancient pile, </l>
              <l>And these grudg'd at, art reuerenc'd the while. </l>
              <l>Thou ioy'st in better markes, of soyle, of ayre, </l>
              <l>Of wood, of water: therein thou art faire. </l>
              <l>Thou hast thy walkes for health, as well as sport: </l>
              <l>Thy Mount, to which the Dryads doe resort, </l>
              <l>Where PAN, and BACCHVS their high feasts haue made, </l>
              <l>Beneath the broad beech, and the chest-nut shade; </l>
              <l>That taller tree, which of a nut was set, </l>
              <l>At his great birth, where all the Muses met. </l>

              <l>And thence, the ruddy Satyres oft prouoke </l>

              <l>Your selfe but told vnto your selfe, and see </l>
              <l>In my character, what your features bee, </l>
              <l>You will not from the paper slightly passe: </l>
              <l>No lady, but, at some time, loues her glasse. </l>
              <l>And this shall be no false one, but as much </l>
              <l>Remou'd, as you from need to haue it such. </l>
              <l>Looke then, and see your selfe. I will not say </l>
              <l>Your beautie; for you see that euery day: </l>
              <l>And so doe many more. All which can call </l>
              <l>It perfect, proper, pure, and naturall▪ </l>
              <l>Not taken vp o'th'doctors, but as well </l>
              <l>As I, can say, and see it doth excell. </l>
              <l>That askes but to be censur'd by the eyes: </l>
              <l>And, in those outward formes, all fooles are wise. </l>
              <l>Nor that your beautie wanted not a dower, </l>
              <l>Doe I reflect. Some alderman has power, </l>
              <l>Or cos'ning farmer of the customes so, </l>
              <l>T'aduance his doubtfull issue, and ore-flow </l>
              <l>A Princes fortune: These are gifts of chance, </l>
              <l>And raise not vertue; they may vice enhance. </l>
              <l>My mirror is more subtile, cleere, refin'd, </l>
              <l>And takes, and giues the beauties of the mind. </l>
              <l>Though it reiect not those of FORTVNE: such </l>
              <l>As bloud, and match. Wherein, how more then much </l>
              <l>Are you engaged to your happy fate, </l>
              <l>For such a lot! that mixt you with a state </l>
              <l>Of so great title, birth, but vertue most, </l>
              <l>Without which, all the rest were sounds, or lost. </l>
              <l>'Tis onely that can time, and chance defeat: </l>
              <l>For he, that once is good, is euer great. </l>
              <l>Wherewith, then, Madame, can you better pay </l>
              <l>This blessing of your starres, then by that way </l>
              <l>Of vertue, which you tread? what if alone? </l>
              <l>Without companions? 'Tis safe to haue none. </l>
              <l>In single paths, dangers with ease are watch'd: </l>
              <l>Contagion in the prease is soonest catch'd. </l>
              <l>This makes, that wisely you decline your life, </l>
              <l>Farre from the maze of custome, error, strife, </l>
              <pb n="837" xml:id="ep000090-445-b"/>
              <l>And keepe an euen, and vnalter'd gaite; </l>
              <l>Not looking by, or backe (like those, that waite </l>
              <l>Times, and occasions, to start forth, and seeme) </l>
              <l>Which though the turning world may dis-esteeme, </l>
              <l>Because that studies spectacles, and showes, </l>
              <l>And after varyed, as fresh obiects goes, </l>
              <l>Giddie with change, and therefore cannot see </l>
              <l>Right, the right way: yet must your comfort bee </l>
              <l>Your conscience, and not wonder, if none askes </l>
              <l>For truthes complexion, where they all weare maskes. </l>
              <l>Let who will follow fashions, and attyres, </l>
              <l>Maintayne their liedgers forth, for forraine wyres, </l>
              <l>Melt downe their husbands land, to poure away </l>
              <l>On the close groome, and page, on new-yeeres day, </l>
              <l>And almost, all dayes after, while they liue; </l>
              <l>(They finde it both so wittie, and safe to giue.) </l>
              <l>Let 'hem on poulders, oyles, and paintings, spend, </l>
              <l>Till that no vsurer, nor his bawds dare lend </l>
              <l>Them, or their officers: and no man know, </l>
              <l>Whether it be a face they weare, or no. </l>
              <l>Let 'hem waste body, and state; and after all, </l>
              <l>When their owne Parasites laugh at their fall, </l>
              <l>May they haue nothing left, whereof they can </l>
              <l>Boast, but how oft they haue gone wrong to man: </l>
              <l>And call it their braue sinne. For such there be </l>
              <l>That doe sinne onely for the infamie: </l>
              <l>And neuer thinke, how vice doth euery houre, </l>
              <l>Eate on her clients, and some one deuoure. </l>
              <l>You, Madame, yong haue learn'd to shunne these shelues, </l>
              <l>Whereon the most of mankinde wracke themselues, </l>
              <l>And, keeping a iust course, haue earely put </l>
              <l>Into your harbor, and all passage shut </l>
              <l>'Gainst stormes, or pyrats, that might charge your peace; </l>
              <l>For which you worthy are the glad encrease </l>
              <l>Of your blest wombe, made fruitfull from aboue, </l>
              <l>To pay your lord the pledges of chast loue: </l>
              <l>And raise a noble stemme, to giue the fame, </l>
              <l>To CLIFTON'S bloud, that is deny'd their name. </l>
              <l>Grow, grow, faire tree, and as thy branches shoote, </l>
              <l>Heare, what the Muses sing about thy roote, </l>
              <l>By me, their priest (if they can ought diuine) </l>
              <l>Before the moones haue fill'd their tripple trine, </l>
              <l>To crowne the burthen which you goe withall, </l>
              <l>It shall a ripe and timely issue fall, </l>

              <l>GOod, and great GOD, can I not thinke of thee, </l>
              <l>But it must, straight, my melancholy bee? </l>
              <l>Is it interpreted in me disease, </l>
              <l>That, laden with my sinnes, I seeke for ease? </l>
              <l>O, be thou witnesse, that the reynes dost know, </l>
              <l>And hearts of all, if I be sad for show, </l>
              <l>And iudge me after: if I dare pretend </l>
              <l>To ought but grace, or ayme at other end. </l>
              <l>As thou art all, so be thou all to mee, </l>
              <l>First, midst, and last, conuerted one, and three; </l>
              <l>My faith, my hope, my loue: and in this state, </l>
              <l>My iudge, my witnesse, and my aduocate. </l>
              <l>Where haue I beene this while exil'd from thee? </l>
              <l>And whither rap'd, now thou but stoup'st to mee? </l>
              <l>Dwell, dwell here still: O, being euery-where, </l>
              <l>How can I doubt to finde thee euer, here? </l>
              <l>I know my state, both full of shame, and scorne, </l>
              <l>Conceiu'd in sinne, and vnto labour borne, </l>
              <l>Standing with feare, and must with horror fall, </l>
              <l>And destin'd vnto iudgement after all. </l>
              <l>I feele my griefes too, and there scarce is ground, </l>
              <l>Vpon my flesh t'inflict another wound. </l>
              <l>Yet dare I not complaine, or wish for death </l>
              <l>With holy PAVL, lest it be thought the breath </l>
              <l>Of discontent; or that these prayers bee </l>
              <l>For wearinesse of life, not loue of thee. </l>
