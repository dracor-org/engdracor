              <p>One Somerton, the honester man of the two, by 5 l. in every stone-weight. A civil Fellow. He has a fine convenient Estate of land in West-ham by Essex. M. Ranges that dwells by Enfield, sent him hither. He likes Kate well. I may tell you, I think she likes him as well. If they agree, I'll not hinder the match for my part. But that Warbeck is such another—. I use him kindly for Mr. Somerton's sake: for he came hither first as a Companion of his. Honest men, Mr. Thorney, may fall into Knaves company, now and then. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
