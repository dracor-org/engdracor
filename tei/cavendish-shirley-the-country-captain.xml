I could teare my eye lidds off, that durst let in a mist so darke and so destroyinge: must I sleepe at such a time? that the devill must bee over watch'd too? this howre hath blasted such a hope as the Earth never teem'd with nor the springe gave up in smiling blossoms to the breath of those sweete winds that whisper from the west, a tale of triumph to the yeare, I could dissolve, with cursinge of my Lethargie. How shall I looke upon her face, whose love and bold adventure I have thus rewarded? but passion will not cure my wounde which must bleede till I see her, and then either ceasse blessed by her pardon; or dismisse a life though just, too poore a sacrifice to her Anger.
