        <head>To the true favourer of the Muses, and all good Arts, Thomas Hammon, Esquire, of Graies Inne, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>THe first part of this work I bestowed upon your friend Mr. Iohn Othow, the second I have confer'd upon you, both being incorporated into one House, and noble Societie. The proximitie in your Chambers, and much familiar conference, having bred a mutuall correspondencie betwixt you. The prime motive inviting me to this Dedication; the much love, and many courtesies reflecting upon me from you both: Being the rather incouraged thereunto, that though the subject it self carry no great countenance in the Title, yet it hath not onely past the censure of the Plebe and Gentrie; but of the Patricians and Praetextatae: as also of our royall Augustus and Livia. <pb xml:id="ep000059-038-a"/>The reason why I have selected you my Patrons, was to exclude my self from the number of those of whom Iuvenal speaks, Satyre 7. </p>
        <p>Scire volunt omnes, mercedem solvere nemo. Please you at any of your more leasur'd houres, to vouchsafe the perusall of these sleight papers, your acceptance shall be my recompence. Receive my wishes for your earths happinesse in millions, for your heavens blisse in myriads. Taking my leave of you with that in Adelph. </p>

        <head>To the READER. </head>
        <p>CVrteous Reader, if thou beest tired in the first part, I would not wish thee to be travel'd in the second; but I hope much better, and that thou didst leave in the last, as one that came late to his Inne to rest himself for that night, onely with purpose to go on with the second, as he that riseth early the next morning (having refresh't himself) to proceed on his journey. By this time you cannot choose but be acquainted with the most of our Acts, but not with all; and more particularly for Spencer, and his westerne Besse. With these Countreymen of ours in their fellowship, you have heard the beginning of their troubles, but are not yet come to the end of their travells; in which you may accompany them on land, without the prejudice of deep wayes, or robbers; and by Sea, free from the danger of rocks or Pirates; as neither using horse or ship, more then this book in thine hand, and thy chaire in thy chamber. More complement I purpose not, and (I hope) thou expectest not. Farewell. </p>
