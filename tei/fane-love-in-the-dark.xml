     TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE, JOHN, Earl of ROCHESTER. Gentleman of His MAJESTIES Bed-chamber.
    </head>
    <opener>
     My LORD,
    </opener>
    <p>
     OFFenders, long conniv'd at, come at last to be try'd for their Lives, and are forc'd to call upon their fatally indulgent friends to bring them off: for Volunteer Poets are at least as mad as those who, out of wantonness play themselves into the Gallies. 'Tis high time to cast my self at your Lordships, Feet, and humbly beg your Protection to this ride Piece, which grew the bolder by your incouragement. All Poems in their Dedications, ought to return to your Lordship, as all Rivers to the Sea, from whose depth and Saltness they are season'd and supply'd: none of them ever coming to your Lordship's hands, without receiving some of the rich Tinctures of your unerring Judgement; and running with much more clearness, having past so fine a strainer. If this receives any approbation in the World, I must ascribe it principally to your Lordship's partial recommendations, and impartial corrections. Your Lordship is the first person in the World, by whom I have been Highly and Heroically oblig'd: and if the first Impressions of Gratitude, may be as strong and captivating, as those of the first Love; they must needs be much more lasting and immutable, in my Passion for your Lordship; since the World affords no object so high and admirable, ever
     <pb xml:id="ep000571-003-a"/>
     to work a change; your Lordship being the most accomplish'd of all Mankind, that I ever knew, read, or heard of, by Humane testimony. Eminent Beings are as hard to be believ'd, as they are to be understood: and no Man can speak Truth of your Lordship's Superlative Endowments, without suspicion of Flattery; nor conceal them without conviction of Ignorance. That famous Temper of weight, so rarely found in Bodies, appears most Illustriously in your Lordship's Mind. Judgement, and Fancy, seldom concurring in other Men, in any small proportion, are possest by your Lordship in the highest degree that ever was allow'd the Soul of Man; yet with so happy and harmonious a mixture, that neither of them predominate nor usurp; but, like two peaceful Colleagues in Empire, agree within themselves, and govern the rest of the World; acting in your Lordships noble, and elevated Mind, like Fire and Air in the upper Region, whose Purity makes them easily convertible, and mutually assistant, whilst they are always quarrelling and preying upon each other, in gross inferior Bodies. What was favourably said of my Lord Bacon in his time, may much more justly be affirm'd of your Lordship, in yours; That if ever there were a beam of Knowledge, immediately deriv'd from God, upon any Man, since the Creation, there is one upon your self. Others, by wearisome steps, and regular gradations, climb up to knowledge; your Lordship is flown up to the top of the Hill: you are an Enthusiast in Wit; a Poet and Philosopher by Revelation; and have already in your tender age, set out such new and glorious Lights in Poetry, yet those so Orthodox and Vnquestionable, that all the Heroes of Antiquity, must submit, or Homer and Virgil be judg'd Nonconformists. For my part, I account it one of the great felicities of my life, to have liv'd in your age; but much greater, to have had access to your Person, and to have been cherysh'd and enlighten'd by the influences, and irradiations of so great a Luminary. For, I must confess, I never return from your Lordships most Charming and Instructive Conversation, but I am inspir'd with a new Genius, and improv'd in all those Sciences. I ever coveted the knowledge of: I find my self, not only a better Poet, a better Philosopher; but, much more than these, a better Christian: your Lordship's-miraculous Wit; and
     <pb xml:id="ep000571-003-b"/>
     Intellectual pow'rs being the greatest Argument that ever I could meet with, for the immateriality of the Soul; they being the highest exaltation of humane Nature; and, under Divine Authority, much more convincing to suspicious Reason, than all the Pedantick proofs of the most Learnedly peevish Disputants: so that, I hope, I shall be oblig'd to your Lordship, not only for my Reputation in this World, but my future Happiness in the next. Reflect then, my Lord, I beseech you, on your own sublime perfections, the profuseness of your Favors, my powerful (though presumptuous) inclination to your Person, and judge if it be possible, for any other Man living to pay your Lordship so sincere and affectionate a Veneration, as

      WHat though 't has been the Genius of this Age,
     </l>
     <l>
      Tame Pegasus to fetter on the Stage;
     </l>
     <l>
      T' imprison in close Rimes, well-govern'd Rage?

      Alas 'tis easier much for them in France,

     <l>
      The English do but Walk, when Frenchmen Dance,

      Rhyme comes to them by Nature, Wit by Chance.

      To good Wits but a shade, to bad a Skreen.

      Then since our Heroes rowz'd with French Allarms,

      Have beat the Mounsieurs at their own slight Arms,

I have no less than Fifteen Marriages on foot; four of 'em are already consummated, by the help of some flight Vows, without the solemn Perjury in a Church: five or six more are finely warm'd and soften'd, and ready for the Seal; and all are at a stand, for want of these same little scraps of Paper, call'd

       THis is the backside of Cornanti's Palace, and this his Ladies Chamber Window the Confessor spoke of. There is no failing of Women it their critical minutes, if you do, they'l hate you ever after, and think you want vigor, or apprehension. Counsels in Love, like Stratagems in War, are to be taken on the suddain, when you find the Enemy in disorder, or your own Men sittest for action. I'll give her a Song; but none of your whining Ditties to Women of experience. Boy, play the Tune I told you of.

        The Boy Plays, and Bellinganna appears at the Window, Vigilia her Duegna in a Veil and Muffler peeping after her.

        I, or at any time. If People love well, there needs no Marriage to confine 'em, if not, 'tis cruelty to couple two churlish disagreeing Curs, and sin not to unloose 'em. I would not use my Dogs so. True; Men are chain'd in Gallies, Horses bridled, and Oxen yoak'd to work:

        Constraint is necessary, but for the Sweets of Love,

        Right. This sort of fools walk always with dark Lanthorns; and they ought more to be fin'd for wearing Vizors over their follies, than others over their faces.

        Troth, Gentlemen, my opinion is, That all extraordinary fools ought to have Pensions, instead of Punishments, especially those that bring up a new Mode of Folly. There is Honor due to Eminence in all things, and rewards for new inventions.

        True; if all men were wise, there would be none to make sport with. Fools serve for honest men to laugh at, as well as Knaves to prey upon.

        I, more than that; if there were no Fools, there would be no Wits. Every new Fool begets a new Play; either as the Subject, or the Composer.

     EPILOGUE, As it was spoke by Mr. Haines.
    </head>
    <l>
     AS Charms are Nonsence, Nonsence seems a Charm,
    </l>
    <l>
     Which hearers of all Judgment does disarm;
    </l>
    <l>
     For Songs and Scenes, a double Audience bring,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Doggrel takes, which Smiths in Sattin sing.
    </l>
    <l>
     Now to Machines, and a dull Mask you run,
    </l>
    <l>
     We find that Wit's the Monster you would shun,
    </l>
    <l>
     And by my troth 'tis most discreetly done.
    </l>
    <l>
     For since, with Vice and Folly, Wit is fed,
    </l>
    <l>
     Through Mercy 'tis, most of you are not dead.
    </l>
    <l>
     Players turn Puppets now at your desire,
    </l>
    <l>
     In their Mouth's Nonsence, in their Tails a Wire,
    </l>
    <l>
     They fly through Clouds of Clouts, and showers of Fire.
    </l>
    <l>
     A kind of loosing Loadum is their Game,
    </l>
    <l>
     Where the worst Writer has the greatest Fame.
    </l>
    <l>
     To get vile Plays like theirs, shall be our care;
    </l>
    <l>
     But of such awkard Actors we despair.
    </l>
    <l>
     False taught at first&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Like Bowls ill byass'd, still the more they run,
    </l>
    <l>
     They're further off, then when they first begun.
    </l>
    <l>
     In Comedy their unweigh'd Action mark,
    </l>
    <l>
     There's one is such a dear familiar spark,
    </l>
    <l>
     He yawns, as if he were but half awake;
    </l>
    <l>
     And fribling for free speaking, does mistake.
    </l>
    <l>
     False accent and neglectful Action too
    </l>
    <l>
     They have both so nigh good, yet neither true,
    </l>
    <l>
     That both together, like an Ape's mock face
    </l>
    <l>
     By near resembling Man, do Man disgrace.
    </l>
    <l>
     Through pac'd ill Actors, may perhaps be cur'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     Half Players like half Wits, can't be endur'd.
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet these are they, who durst expose the Age
    </l>
    <l>
     Of the great Wonder of our English Stage.

     Whom Nature seem'd to form for your delight,
    </l>

     And bid him speak, as she bid Shakespeare write.

    <l>
     Those Blades indeed are Cripples in their Art
    </l>
    <l>
     Mimmick his Foot, but not his speaking part.
    </l>
    <l>
     Let them the Traytor or Volpone try,
    </l>
    <l>
     Could they&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Rage like Cethegus, or like Cassius die,
    </l>
    <l>
     They ne'er had sent to Paris for such Fancies,
    </l>
    <l>
     As Monster's heads, and Merry Andrew's Dances.
    </l>
    <l>
     Wither'd perhaps, not perish'd we appear,
    </l>
    <l>
     But they were blighted, and ne'er came to bear.
    </l>
    <l>
     Th'old Poets dress'd your Mistress Wit before,
    </l>
    <l>
     These draw you on with an old Painted Whore,
    </l>
    <l>
     And sell like Bawds, patch'd Plays for Maids twice o'er.
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet they may scorn our House and Actors too,
    </l>
    <l>
     Since they have swell'd so high to hector you.
    </l>
    <l>
     They cry, Pox o' these
     <hi>
      Covent Garden
     </hi>
     Men,
    </l>
    <l>
     Dam 'em, not one of them, but keeps out Ten.
    </l>
    <l>
     Were they once gone, we for those thundering Blades,
    </l>
    <l>
     Should have an Audience of substantial Trades,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who love our muzzled Boys, and tearing Fellows,
    </l>
    <l>
     My Lord great Neptune, and great Nephew Eolus.
    </l>
    <l>
     Oh how the merry Citizen's in love
    </l>
    <l>
     With&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Psyche, the Goddess of each Field and Grove.
    </l>
    <l>
     He cryes i' faith, methinks 'tis well enough,
    </l>
    <l>
     But you roar out and cry, 'Tis all damn'd stuff.
    </l>
    <l>
     So to their House the graver Fops repair,
    </l>
    <l>
     While Men of Wit, find one another here.
