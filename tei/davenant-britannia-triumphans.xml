        <head>BRITANNIA Triumphans. </head>
        <p>PRINCES of sweet and humane Natures have ever both amongst the Ancients and Modernes in the best times, presented spectacles, and personall representations, to recreate their Spirits wasted in grave affaires of State, and for the entertainment of their Nobilitie, Ladies, and Courts. </p>
        <p>There being now past three yeers of Intermission, that the King and Queenes Majesties have not made Masques with shewes and Intermdij, by reason the roome where formerly they were presented, having the seeling since richly adorn'd with peeces of painting of great value, figuring the acts of King Iames of happy memory, and other inrichments: lest this might suffer by the smoake of many lights, his Majestie commanded the Surveyor of his workes, that a new temporary roome of Timber, both for strength and capacitie of spectators, should bee suddenly built for that use; which being performed in two moneths, the Scenes for this Masque were prepared. </p>
        <div type="part" xml:id="ep000087-e100110">
          <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000087-003-a"/>
          <head>The Subject of this Masque. </head>
          <p>BRitanocles, the glory of the Westerne world, hath by his wisedome, valour, and pietie, not onely vindicated his owne, but farre distant Seas, infested with Pyrats, and reduc'd the land (by his example) to a reall knowledge of all good Arts and Sciences. These eminent Acts Bellerophon in a wise pittie willingly would preserve from devouring time, and therefore to make them last to our Posteritie, gives a command to Fame, (who hath already spred them abroad) that shee should now at home (if there can bee any maliciously insensible) awake them from their pretended sleepe, that even they with the large yet still increasing number of the good and loyall, may mutually admire and rejoyce in our happinesse. </p>
          <p>THe Queens Majestie being seated under the State, and the roome fild with Spectators of qualitie, at the lower end of the roome was a Stage raised of a convenient height, and an Ovall staire downe into the roome: That which first presented it selfe to the eye, was the Ornament that enclosed the Scene. </p>
          <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000087-003-b"/>
          <p>In the under part of this were two pedestalls of a solid order whereon captives lay bound, above sate two figures in neeches; on the right hand a woman in a watchet drapery, heightned with silver, on her head a Corona Rostrata, with one hand holding the rudder of a ship, &amp; in the other a little winged figure with a branch of Palme, and a Girland; this woman represented Navall victory. Opposite to this in the other neech sate the figure of a man bearing a Scepter with a hand and an eye in the Palme, and in the other hand a booke, on his head a Girland of Amaranthus, his Curace was of gold, with a Palludamentum of blue and Antike bases of Crimson, his foot treading on the head of a Serpent; by this figure was signified right government: above these were other composed ornaments cut out like cloth of silver, tied up in knots with scarfings all touch'd with gold. </p>
          <p>These Pillasters bore up a large Freese with a Sea triumph of naked children, riding on sea horses &amp; fishes, and young Tritons with writhen trumpets, and other maritime fancies. In the midst was placed a great compartiment of gold, with branches of Palme comming out of the scrowles, and within that a lesser of silver with this inscription, VIRTVTIS OPVS, proper to the subject of this Masque, and alluding to that of Virgil— Sed famam extendere factis, &amp;c. from this came a drapery of Crimson, which tied up with great knots in the corners hung downe in foulds on the sides of the Pillasters. </p>
          <p>A curtaine flying up discovered the first Scene, wherein were English houses of the old and newer formes, intermixt with trees, and a farre off a prospect <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000087-004-a"/>of the Citie of London, and the River of Thames, which being a principall part, might bee taken for all great Britaine. </p>
          <p>From severall parts of the Scene came Action and Imposture. Action a young man in a rich habit downe to his knees, with a large gard of purple about the skirt, wherein was written with silver letters, MEDIO TVTISSIMA, on his head a girland of Laurell, and in one hand a branch of willow: Imposture in a coar with hanging sleeves and great skirts, little breeches, a high crownd hat one side pind up, a little ruffe, and a formall beard, and an angling rod in his hand with a fish at the hooke, with a bag and a horne at his girdle. </p>
