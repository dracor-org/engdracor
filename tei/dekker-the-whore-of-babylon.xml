        <p>THe Generall scope of this Drammaticall Poem, is to set forth (in Tropicall and shadowed collours) the Greatnes, Magnanimity, Constancy, Clemency, and other the incomparable Heroical vertues of our late Queene And (on the contrary part) the inueterate malice, Treasons, Machinations Vnderminings, &amp; continual blody stratagems, of that Purple whore of Roome, to the taking away of our Princes liues, and vtter extirpation of their Kingdomes. Wherein if according to the dignity of the Subiect, I haue not giuen it Lustre, and (to vse the Painters rhethorick) doe so faile in my Depthes &amp; Heightnings, that it is not to the life, let this excuse me; that the Pyramides vpon whose top the glorious Raigne of our deceased Soueraigne was mounted, stands yet so high, and so sharply pointed into the clouds, that the Art of no pen is able to reach it. The streame of her Vertues is so immensurable, that the farther they are waded into, the farther is it to the bottom. </p>
        <p>In sayling vpon which two contrary Seas, you may obserue, on how direct a line I haue steered my course: for of such a scantling are my words set downe, that neither the one party speakes too much, nor the other (in opposition) too little in their owne defence. </p>
        <p>And whereas I may, (by some more curious in censure, then sound in iudgement) be Critically taxed, that I falsifie the account of time, and set not down Occurrents, according to their true succession, let such (that are so nice of stomach) know, that I write as a Poet, not as an Historian, and that these two doe not <pb rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000386-003-a"/>liue vnder one law. How true Fortunes dyall hath gone whose Players (like so many clocks, haue struck my lines, and told the world how I haue spent my houres) I am not certaine, because mine eare stood not within reach of their Larums. But of this my knowledge cannot faile, that in such Consorts, many of the Instruments are for the most partout of tune, And no maruaile; for let the Poet set the note of his Nombers, euen to Apolloes owne Lyre, the Player will haue his owne Crochets, and sing false notes, in dispite of all the rules of Musick. It fares with these two, as it does with good stuffe and a badde Tayler: It is not mard in the wearing, but in the cutting out. The labours therfore of Writers are as vnhappie as the children of a bewtifull woman, being spoyld by ill nurses, within a month after they come into the world. What a number of throwes doe we endure eare we be deliuered? and yet euen then (tho that heauenly issue of our braine be neuer so faire and so well lymd,) is it made lame by the bad handling of them to whome it is put to learne to goe: if this of mine bee made a cripple by such meanes, yet dispise him not for that deformity which stuck not vpon him at his birth; but fell vpon him by mis-fortune, and in recompence of such favour, you shall (if your Patience can suffer so long) heare now how himselfe can speake. </p>

          <l>May hang at euery eare, for wee present </l>
          <l>Matter aboue the vulgar Argument: </l>

          <l>(Through those thin vailes we hang betweene your sight, </l>
          <l>And this our peice) may reach the mistery: </l>
          <l>What in it is most graue, will most delight. </l>
          <l>But as in Lantskip, Townes and Woods appeare </l>
          <l>Small a farre off, yet to the Optick sence, </l>
          <l>The mind shewes them as great as those more neere; </l>
          <l>So, winged Time that long agoe flew hence </l>
          <l>You must fetch backe, with all those golden yeares </l>

          <l>There hold it but two howres, It shall from Graues </l>
          <l>Raize vp the dead: vpon this narrow floore </l>
          <l>Swell vp an Ocean, (with an Armed Fleete,) </l>
          <l>And lay the Dragon at a Doues softfeete. </l>
          <l>These Wonders sit and see, sending as guides </l>
          <l>Your Iudgement, not your passions: passion slides, </l>
          <l>When Iudgement goes vpright: for tho the Muse </l>
          <l>(That's thus inspir'de) a Nouell path does tread, </l>
          <l>Shee's free from foolish boldnes, or base dread. </l>
          <l>Loe; scorne she scornes and Enuies ranckling tooth, </l>

        <p>HE drawes a Curtaine, discouering Truth in sad abiliments; vncrownd: her haire disheueld, &amp; sleeping on a Rock: Time (her father) attired likewise in black, and al his properties (as Sithe, Howreglasse and Wings) of the same Cullor, vsing all meanes to waken Truth, but not being able to doe it, he sits by her and mourns. Then enter Friers, Bishops, Cardinals before the Hearse of a Queen, after it Councellors, Pentioners &amp; Ladies, al these last hauing scarses before their eyes, the other singing in Latin. Trueth suddenly awakens, &amp; beholding this sight, shews (with her father) arguments of Loy, and Exeunt, returning presently: Time being shifted into light Cullors, his properties likewise altred into siluer, and Truth Crowned, (being cloathed in a robespotted with Starres) meete the Hearfe, and pulling the veiles from the Councellers eyes, they woundring a while, and seeming astonished at her brightnes, at length embrace Truth and Time, &amp; depart with them: leauing the rest going on. </p>
        <p>This being done, Enter Titania (the Farie Queene) attended with those Councellors, and other persons fitting her estate: Time and Truth meete her, presenting a Booke to her, which (kissing it) shee receiues, and shewing it to those about her, they drawe out their swordes, (embracing Truth,) vowing to defend her and that booke: Truth then and Time are sent in, and returne presently, driuing before them those Cardinals, Friers &amp;c. (that came in before) with Images, Croziar staues &amp;c. They gon, certaine graue learned men, that had beene banished, are brought in, and presented to Titania, who shewes to them the booke, which they receiue with great signes of gladnesse, and <foreign xml:lang="lat">Exeunt Omnes</foreign>. </p>
