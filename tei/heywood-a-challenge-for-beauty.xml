        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <l>THe Roman and Athenian Drammaes farre </l>
        <l>Differ from us, And those that frequent are </l>
        <l>In Italy and France, even in these dayes, </l>
        <l>Compar'd with ours, are rather jiggs than Playes: </l>
        <l>Like of the Spanish may be said, and Dutch, </l>
        <l>None verst in language, but confesse them such. </l>
        <l>They doe not build their projects on that ground, </l>
        <l>Nor have their phrases halfe the weight and sound </l>
        <l>Our laboured Scenes have had; (and yet our Nation, </l>
        <l>Already too much taxt for imitation, </l>
        <l>In seeking to Ape others) cannot quit </l>
        <l>Some of our Poets, who have sinn'd in it. </l>
        <l>For where before great Patriots, Dukes and Kings </l>
        <l>Presented for some hie facinorious things, </l>
        <l>Were the Stage-Subiect; now we strive to flie </l>
        <l>In their low pitch, who never could soare hie: </l>
        <l>For now the common argument intreats, </l>
        <l>Of puling Lovers, craftie Bawdes or cheates. </l>
        <l>Nor blame I their quick fancies, who can fit </l>
        <l>These queasie Times, with Humours flash't in wit, </l>
        <l>Whose Art I both incourage and commend; </l>
        <l>I only wish that they would sometimes bend </l>
        <l>To memorise the valours of such men, </l>
        <l>Whose very names might dignifie the Pen, </l>
        <l>And that our (once applauded) Roscian straine, </l>
        <l>In acting such might be reviv'd againe: </l>
        <l>Which you to countenance, would the Stage make proud, </l>
        <l>And Poets strive to key their strings more loud, </l>

          <p>In Flushing, there is good riding, but not without danger. For many at a high tide, have been like to have beene cast away in the road. At Middleborough, night or day you could scarce finde the Exchange empty. At Bristles, if you remember you were us'd but roughly: At Sluce we were both well wash't, Nimmingham bid you looke to your Skonce: and Ostend, beware the Cat. Don-hague is full of Witches, and had wee but tutcht at Rot or Dam, ten to one we had never come off sound men. Much adoo wee had to finde New-Port: Therefore if ever you come to Bergen, see you make it wisely. </p>
