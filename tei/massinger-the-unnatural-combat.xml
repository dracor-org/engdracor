        </opener>
        <p>THat the Patronage of trifles, in this kinde, hath long since rendred Dedications, and Inscriptions obsolete, and out of fashion, I perfectly understand, and cannot but ingenuously confesse, that I walking in the same path, may be truly argued by you of weaknesse, or wilfull errour: but the reasons and defences, for the tender of my service this way to you, are so just, that I cannot (in my thankefulnesse for so many favours received) but be ambitious to publish them. Your noble Father, Sir Warham Sentliger (whose remarkeable vertues must be ever remembred) being, while hee lived, a master, for his pleasure, in Poetry, feared not to hold converse with divers, whose necessitous fortunes made it their profession, among which, by the clemency of his judgement, I was not in the last place admitted. You (the Heire of his honour and inherited his good inclinations to men of my poore quality, of <pb xml:id="ep000173-003-a"/>which I cannot give any ampler testimony than by my free and glad profession of it to the world. Besides, (and it was not the least encouragement to mee) many of eminence and the best of such, who disdained not to take notice of mee, have not thought themselves disparaged, I dare not say honoured, to be celebrated the Patrons of my humble studies. In the first file of which, I am confident, you shall have no cause to blush, to finde your Name written. I present you with this old Tragedie, without Prologue, or Epilogue, it being composed in a time (and that too, peradventure, as knowing as this) when such by ornaments, were not advanced above the fabricque of the whole worke. Accept it I beseech you, as it is, and continue you favour to the Author. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
