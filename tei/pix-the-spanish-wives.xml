      SIR,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     YOU may please to remember, when I had the Honour to be in your Company last, at Soundess; part of our Discourse was upon Dedications. I believe you did not then apprehend the Danger so near. But, this Play being kindly receiv'd by the Audience; I hope it will not meet with a worse Fate, when it claims your Protection. You have known me from my Childhood, and my
     <hi>
      Inclination to Poetry
     </hi>
     ; and 'tis from
     <pb xml:id="ep000676-003-a"/>
     the Happiness of that Acquaintance, I presume to make so Worthless an Offering. This also, joyn'd with your Good Humour, secures me from the Severity of your Iudgment, which gives you Power to be the greatest of Criticks. I need not tell England, how much you have always Serv'd your Country; since that would be like Proclaiming it to be Light at Noon-day. I know, all Witty Men, especially your self, hate any thing, that tends towards Flattery; therefore I shall only in Sincerity tell you: I am,
    </p>
    <closer>
     <salute>
      SIR,
     </salute>
     <signed>
      Your very Humble, and most Obliged Servant,
      <hi>

     PROLOGUE, Spoken by Mr. Penkethman, in a Press-master's Habit.
    </head>
    <l>
     WHat Chear, my Lads? Igad, I'm come to say,
    </l>
    <l>
     I'll press to Sea all those who Damn this Play:
    </l>
    <l>
     Lord! how our Ship might here be Mann'd to day!
    </l>
    <l>
     Sea-fights, 'tis thought, won't much agree with those
    </l>
    <l>
     Whom they call Wits, and less with
     <hi>
      Mealy Beaus
     </hi>
     .
    </l>
    <l>
     Mayhaps 'twou'd make them stink; for, every Year,
    </l>
    <l>
     We don't go to drink Punch, and take
     <hi>
      French Air.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     But sure, the Gentlewomen are at rest,
    </l>
    <l>
     None of them are afraid of being Prest.
    </l>
    <l>
     Well, how's the Wind here? Still that's veering round,
    </l>
    <l>
     Like your Church-Weathercocks, on English Ground,
    </l>
    <l>
     Then hiss it goes; Oh, that's a plaguy Sound:
    </l>
    <l>
     Igad, 'tis worse to every Actor's Ear,
    </l>
    <l>
     Than Frets of Wind to your huge Mops of Hair.
    </l>
    <l>
     For thus your
     <hi>
      Cri&#8212; Criticks
     </hi>
     serve Nine Plays in Ten,
    </l>
    <l>
     Worse than
     <hi>
      Jack Frenchman
     </hi>
     does our Merchant-men.
    </l>
    <l>
     Like Pyrates too, while honest men they're breaking,
    </l>
    <l>
     The damn'd Fresh-water Sharks are n't worth the taking:
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet long to maul these same New Plays as much
    </l>
    <l>
     As we, when Homeward bound, to take a Touch;
    </l>
    <l>
     Or, as Dubart, to snap his Brother Dutch.
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet why shou'd they Hiss Plays not worth regarding?
    </l>
    <l>
     Do we Bombard a Town not worth Bombarding?
    </l>
    <l>
     Drolls shortly will amuse ye at the Fair:
    </l>
    <l>
     To like This, think your selves already there,
    </l>
    <l>
     As for you Spruce Gallants, pray be n't too nice,
    </l>
    <l>
     But shew you can Oblige a Woman twice.
    </l>
    <l>
     The First Time she was grave, as well she might,
    </l>
    <l>
     For Women will be damn'd sullen the first Night;
    </l>
    <l>
     But faith, they'l quickly mend, so be n't uneasie:
    </l>
    <l>
     To Night she's brisk, and trys
     <hi>
      New Tricks
     </hi>
     to please ye.

     EPILOGUE, Spoken by Mrs. Verbruggen.
    </head>
    <l>
     OVR Author, by me, puts up her humble Pray'r,
    </l>
    <l>
     This Farce, this Trifle of a Play, you'll spare.
    </l>
    <l>
     I'll try your good Nature: But, oh! I fear
    </l>
    <l>
     You are not like my fond Old Husband here.
    </l>
    <l>
     Then, first, my Character who will admire?
    </l>
    <l>
     Some will think it too cold; others, too full of Fire.
    </l>
    <l>
     I dare swear every Spark here will say,
    </l>
    <l>
     Damn it, that Cursed Baulk has spoil'd the Play.
    </l>
    <l>
     Then the Ladies my Staggering won't allow,
    </l>
    <l>
     They'l cry, Where's her strict Rules of Virtue now?
    </l>
    <l>
     But the Ladies are not so ignorant: All know
    </l>
    <l>
     The Difference 'twixt a Spanish Husband, and a Beau.
    </l>
    <l>
     With Submission our Author still appears;
    </l>
    <l>
     Courts your Indulgence, and your Iudgment fears;
    </l>
    <l>
     Lives on your Smiles, and at your Frowns despairs.

       First then, the damn'd old jealous Marquess caught me, and notwithstanding my counterfeit Speech and Simplicity, had me amongst his Varlets, to be search'd. They knew his Custom, and no sooner enter'd, but they flew upon me like so many Furies: I fear'd it had been to tear me Limb from Limb; but it prov'd only to tear my Clothes off; which was done in a twinkling, and I left as naked as my Mother bore me; whilst the old Marquess, grovel'd all over my habiliments, and run Pins in 'em, so thick, that a poor Louse wou'd not have 'scap'd spitting. The only thing which pleas'd me, was to observe a Peep-hole the Maids (knowing this to be their Master's Searching-room) had made; and sometimes one Eye, sometimes another, viewing my Proportions.
