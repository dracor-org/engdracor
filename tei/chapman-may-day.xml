Fit, fit obseruance for this May-morning; Not the May-Moneth alone, they take when it comes; Nor the first weeke of that Moneth; Nor the first day; but the first minute of the first houre, of the first day. Loose no time bloods, loose no time; though the Sunne goe to bedde neuer so much before you, yet be you vp before him; call the golden sluggard from the siluer armes of his Lady, to light you into yours, when your old father Ianuary here in one of his last dayes, thrusts his fore-head into the depth of Mayes fragrant bosome: What may you Aprilles performe then? O what may you doe? Well yet will I say thus much for my selfe, wheresoeuer the affections of youth are, there must needs be the instruments, and where the instruments are, there must of necessity be the faculties; What am I short of them then? A sound old man, ably constituted, holsomly dyeted, that tooke his May <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000337-003-a"/>temperately at their ages, and continued his owne; why should he not continue their ages in his owne? By the Masse I feele nothing that stands against it, and therefore sweet May I salute thee with the yongest: I haue loue to employ thee in, as well as the prowdest yong princock, and so haue at you Mistris Frances China: haue at you Mistris Franke: I'le sprede my nets for you yfaith, though they be my very purse nets, wherein what heart will not willingly lye panting? <stage xml:id="ep000337-e100160">(Enter Angelo.) </stage>
