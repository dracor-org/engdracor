        <head>The PREFACE TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>I Know very well the danger of Writing in such an age where the best Wits Chose rather to be lookerson, then expose their stock of reputation to Publick censure. Nor did I design any to my self by this Play: It was originally Maenanders in the Greek, Terence's in the Latin; whose great names gave me a Curiosity to try how I cou'd make it run in English: A Friend came to my Chamber as I was upon the first Act, he seem'd to approve my design: I told him I found it extream easie to go through with: And that if he cou'd get it Acted under his own or anothers Name, I wou'd finish it for him: But for I know not what reasons he cou'd not do it; and I was oblidg'd to own it my self, or my friend had lost his third day The whole Play runs upon a Rape committed by a Lover under the disguise of an Eunuch, and an indulgent Keeper, govern'd and Jilted by his Imperious Mistress, which parts were so essential that they cou'd <pb xml:id="ep000706-003-a"/>not be omitted, nor well fitted to our Stage without some expressions or Metaphors, which by persons of a ticklish imagination, or over-quick sense that way, seem'd too lascivious for modest Ears; I confess after the Plays I have seen lately Crowded by that fair Sex: the exception did not a little surprise me; And this suddain change of theirs made me call to mind our English weather, where in the same day a man shall Sweat in Crape, and wish for a Campagn Coat three hours after. I am very unhappy that the Ice that has borne so many Coaches and Carts, shou'd break with my Wheel barrow: I confess to have taken my Idea of Poetry more from the Latin than the French: and had rather be accus'd of some Irregularities, than tire my Reader or Audience with a smooth even stream of insipid words and accidents; such as one can neither like nor find fault with. But Reader between what will not please, and what will not pass at this time; there is so little left to be said on this or any other Subject, that I will keep thee no longer at the Door. Go in and Judge for thy self, see what the Modesty of this year takes offence at, and I am confident thou wilt with me congratulate the happy change. And yet absolve both the Poet and the Translator from any unpresidented indecency. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>IS it not strange to see in such an Age </l>
        <l>The Pulpit get the better of the Stage? </l>
        <l>Not through Rebellion as in former days, </l>
        <l>But Zeal for Sermons and neglect for Plays. </l>
        <l>Here's as good Ogling vet, and fewer spies. </l>
        <l>For Godly Parents watch with whites of Eyes. </l>
        <l>Here Gallants do but pay us for your Room, </l>
        <l>Bring if you please, your own brisk wit from home. </l>
        <l>Proclaim your drunken fray's three benches round </l>
        <l>What Claps y'have met with, and what puuks are sound </l>
        <l>Who are the Bully-rocks: and who gives ground. </l>
        <l>We take all in good part, and never rage: </l>
        <l>Tho the shrill Pit be louder than the Stage. </l>
        <l>There you must sit demure, without a word: </l>
        <l>Nor Perruque comb'd, nor Pocket tortoise stir'd </l>
        <l>Here you may give the Lye, or draw your Sword. </l>
        <l>Be low'd and sensless, huff, dumbfound, and roar; </l>
        <l>Till all the Lady's and some gallants scowre. </l>
        <l>What free born subject, or true English heart, </l>
        <l>Wou'd with such Rights and Priviledges part? </l>
        <l>When our two houses did divide the Town, </l>
        <l>Each Faction zealously maintain'd their own, </l>
        <l>We liv'd on those that came to cry us down. </l>
        <l>Our Emulation did improve your sport: </l>
        <l>Now you come hither but to make your Court: </l>
        <l>Or from adjacent Coffee Houses throng </l>
        <l>At our sourth Act for a new Dance or Song. </l>
        <l>To set all right we yet could make a shift; </l>
        <l>Had we a few good Livings in our gift. </l>
        <l>Your hearts are ours, and let whoever preach </l>
        <l>The young and fair will practice what we teach. </l>
        <l>Our Play old virtuous Rome the Eunuch nam'd </l>
        <l>But modest London the lewd title damn'd. </l>
        <l>Our Author try'd his own and cou'd not hit: </l>
        <l>He now presents you with some Forraign Wit. </l>

When I went first to her, she entertain'd me with a deal of Discourse, far fetch'd, nothing to the purpose: At last she ask'd me, how long my Father and Mother had been Dead? I told her, a great while; then if I had not a Seat in Devonshire, near the Sea? which I have. May be she has a mind to it, and thinks to get it of me. At last, if I had not lost a young Sister? who she was with, and what she had about her when she was lost? What she ask'd all these Questions for, I cannot guess; unless she wou'd put her self upon me for that Sister, but if she be alive, she cannot be above seventeen; and Bellarima is as old as my self.

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>LIke a young Wench that cou'd not well forbear, </l>
        <l>And yet is loath her Lewdness shou'd appear. </l>
        <l>Our modest Poet wou'd have made away </l>
        <l>In private, this mere l●mp you see to day. </l>
        <l>We bid him lay the Bantling at our door </l>
        <l>And for th'event concern himself no more. </l>
        <l>Poets of late with humane Sacrifice </l>
        <l>Have feasted you like Heathen Deities. </l>
        <l>In every Play they serv'd you up a man </l>
        <l>Nay some at Parties and whole Factions ran? </l>
        <l>After such fare, how flat must Terence taste? </l>
        <l>Yet his plain Tales have had the luck to last. </l>
        <l>While your fam'd Authors, in their life time wast. </l>
        <l>Ye all cry out the art of Writings lost </l>
        <l>Yet nicer Judgments in perfection boast. </l>
        <l>Strange Stars; malignant to Poetick strains </l>
        <l>Yet so productive of Judicious brains. </l>
        <l>What if you Judge, as ill as others Write? </l>
        <l>And only loath for want of appetite; </l>
        <l>No Jew into the Sanhedrim might come </l>
        <l>That had no Issue of his own at home. </l>
        <l>For barrenness supposes cruelty </l>
        <l>No Childless man, might others Children try. </l>
        <l>This wholesome Law wou'd save us from the spight </l>
        <l>Of all the furious Wits that cannot Write. </l>
        <l>And you that do, we shou'd not fear your doom </l>
        <l>If you'd Judge here but as you Judge at home; </l>
        <l>Now Gallants most of you are so well bred </l>
        <l>French has long since chas'd Latin from your head </l>
        <l>And Terence yo have forgot or never read. </l>
        <l>Faith spare'um both, lest your chance medly Wit </l>
        <l>Miss the Translator and the Author hit. </l>
