        <head>THE PROLOGVE IN PAVLES. </head>
        <p>GEntlemen, so nice is the world, that for apparrel there is no fashion, for Musick no instrument, for diet no delicate, for playes no inuention but breedeth sacietie before noone, and contempt before night. </p>
        <p>Come to the Tayler, hee is gone to the Paynters, to learne howe more cunning may lurke in the fashion, then can bee expressed in the making. Aske the Musicions, they will say their heads ake with deuising notes beyonde Ela. Enquire at Ordinaries, there must be sallets for the Italian; picktooths for the Spaniard; pots for the German; porridge for the Englishman. At our exercises, Souldiers call for Tragedies, their obiect is bloud: Courtiers for Commedies, their subiect is loue: Countriemen for Pastoralles, Shepheards are their Saintes. Trafficke and trauell hath wouen the nature of all Nations into ours, and made this land like Arras, full of deuise, which was Broade-cloth, full of workemanshippe. </p>
        <p>Time hath confounded our mindes, our mindes the matter, but all commeth to this passe, that what heretofore hath <pb xml:id="ep000141-003-a"/>beene serued in seuerall dishes for a feaste, is now minced in a charger for a Gallimaufrey. If wee present a mingle-mangle, our fault is to be excused, because the whole worlde is become an Hodge-podge. </p>
        <p>Wee are ielous of your iudgementes, because you are wise; of our owne performance, because we are vnperfect; of our Authors deuice, because he is idle. Onelie this doeth encourage vs, that presenting our studies before Gentlemen, thogh they receiue an inward mislike, wee shall not be hist with an open disgrace. </p>

Thou hast filled my belly with meate, mine eares with musicke, mine eies with wonders. Bacchus of all the Gods is the best fellow, and Midas amongst men a king of fellows. All thy grounds are vineyards, thy corne grapes, thy chambers sellers, thy houshold stuffe standing cuppes: and therfore aske any thing it shalbe graunted. Wouldest thou haue the pipes of thy conducts to run wine, the vdders of thy beasts to drop nectar, or thy trees to bud ambrosia? Desirest thou to be fortunate in thy loue, or in thy victories famous, or to haue the yeres of thy life as many as the haires on thy head?

            <p>Loue is a pastime for children, breeding nothing but follie, and nourishing nothing but idlenes. I would wish to be monarch of the world, conquering kingdomes like villages, and being greatest on the earth be commaunder of the whole earth: for what is there that more tickles the mind of a king, then a hope to bee the only king, wringing out of euery countrie tribute, and in his owne to sit in triumph. Those that call conquerors ambitious, are like those that teache thrift couetousnes, clenlines pride, honestie precisenes.

            <p>Nothing, but that these two haue said nothing. I would wish that eueriething I touched might turne to gold: this is the sinewes of warre, and the sweetnesse of peace. Is it not gold that maketh the chastest to yeeld to lust, the honestest to lewdnes, the wisest to follie, the faithfullest to deceit, and the most holy in heart, to be most hollow of hart? In this word Gold are all the powers of the gods, the desires of men, the woonders of the worlde, the miracles of nature, the losenes of fortune and triumphs of time. By gold may you shake the courts of other Princes, and haue your own setled, one spade of gold vndermines faster then an hundred mattocks of steele. Would one be thought religious &amp; deuout? Quantum quisque sua nummorum seruat in arca, tantum habet &amp; fidei: Religions ballance are golden bags. Desire you vertue? querenda pecunia primum est, virtus post nummos: the first staire of vertue is money. Doeth anie thirst after gentrie, and wish to be esteemed beautiful? <pb xml:id="ep000141-004-b"/>&amp; genus &amp; formam regina pecunia donat: king Coin hath a mint to stamp gentlemen, and art to make amiablenes. I denie not but loue is sweet, and the marrowe of a mans minde, that to conquere kings is the quintessence of the thoughts of kings: why ţhen follow both, Aurea sunt vera nunc saecula, plurimus auro venit honos, auro conciliatur amor: it is a world for gold, honor and loue are both taken vp on interest. Doth Midas determine to tempt the mindes of true Subiectes? to drawe them from obedience to trecherie, from their allegiance and othes to treason and periurie? quid non mortalia pectora cogit aurisacra fames? what holes doth not gold bore in mens hearts? Such vertue is there in golde, that being bred in the barrennest ground, and troden vnder foote, it mounteth to sit on Princes heads. Wish gold Midas, or wish not to be Midas. In the councel of the gods, was not Anubis with his long nose of gold, preferred before Neptunes, whose stature was but brasse? And Aesculapius more honored for his golden beard, then Apollo for his sweet harmonie? </p>

            <p>To enioy a faire Ladie in loue, and wante faire gold to geue: to haue thousands of people to fight, and no peny to paye, wil make ones mistresse wilde, and his soldiers tame. Iupiter was a god, but he knew gold was a greater: and flewe into those grates with his golden winges, where he coulde not enter with his Swannes wings. What staide Atlantas course with Hippomanes? <pb xml:id="ep000141-005-a"/>an apple of gold; what made the three goddesses striue? an apple of gold. If therfore thou make not thy mistres a goldfinch, thou mayst chance to find her a wagtaile: beleeue me, Res est ingeniosa dare. Besides, how many gates of cities this golden key hath opened, we may remember of late, and ought to feare hereafter. That iron world is worne out, the golden is now come, Sub Ioue nunc mundus iussa sequare Iouis. </p>

Iustice her selfe, that sitteth wimpled about the eyes, doth it not because shee will take no gold, but that she would not be seene blushing when she takes it: the ballance she holdeth are not to weie the right of the cause, but the weight of the bribe: she wil put vp her naked sword if thou offer her a golden scabberd. </p>

Thus whilest we follow the nature of things, we forget the names. Since this vnsatiable thirst of gold, and vntemperat humor of lust crept into the kings court, Souldiers haue begged almes of Artificers, and with their helmet on their head been glad to follow a Louer with a gloue in his hatte, which so much abateth the courage of true Captaines, that they must account it more honorable, in the court <pb xml:id="ep000141-009-b"/>to be a cowarde so rich and amorus, than in a campe to be valiant, if poore and maimed.

The loue hee hath followed, I feare vnnaturall; the riches he hath got, I know vnmeasurable; the warres he hath leuied, I doubt vnlawfull; hath drawn his bodie with graie haires to the graues mouth; and his minde with eating cares to desperate determinations: ambition hath but two steps, the lowest bloud; the highest enuie: both these hath my vnhappie father climbde, digging mines of gold with the liues of men, and now enuied of the whole world, is enuironed with enemies round about the world, not knowing that ambition hath one heele nayled in hell, though she stretch <pb xml:id="ep000141-010-a"/>her finger to touch the heauens. I woulde the Gods would remoue this punishment, so that Mydas would be penitent. Let him thrust thee, Eristus with thy loue, into Italie, where they honour lust for a God, as the Aegyptians did dogs: thee, Mellacrites with thy greedines of gold, to the vtmost partes of the West, where all the guts of the earth are gold: and thee, Martius, that soundest but bloud and terror, into those barbarous Nations, where nothing is to be found but bloud and terror.

            <p>Miserable Mydas, as vnaduised in thy wish, as in thy successe vnfortunat. O vnquenchable thirst of gold, which turneth mens heads to lead, and makest them blockish; their hearts to iron, and makest them couetous; their eyes to delight in the view, and makest them blinde in the vse. I that did possesse mynes of golde, could not bee contented till my minde were also a myne. Could not the treasure of Phrygia, nor the tributes of Greece, nor mountaines in the East, whose guts are gold, satisfie thy minde with gold? Ambition eateth gold, &amp; drinketh blood; climeth so high by other mens heads, that she breaketh her owne necke. What should I doo with a world of ground, whose bodie must be content with seauen foote of earth? or why did I couet to get so manie crownes, hauing my self but one head? Those that tooke small vessells at the sea, I accompted Pyrates; and <pb xml:id="ep000141-012-b"/>my selfe that suppressed whole Fleetes, a Conquerour: as though robberies of Mydas might masque vnder the names of triumphs, and the traffique of other Nations bee called treacherie. Thou hast pampred vp thy selfe with slaughter, as Diomedes did his horse with blood; so vnsatiable thy thirst, so heauie thy sword. Two bookes haue I alwaies carried in my bosome, calling them the dagger, and the sword; in which the names of all Princes, Noblemen, and Gentlemen were dedicated to slaughter, or if not (which worse is) to slauerie. O my Lords, when I call to minde my cruelties in Lycaonia, my vsurping in Getulia, my oppression in Sola: then do I finde neither mercies in my conquests, nor colour for my warres, nor measure in my taxes. I haue written my lawes in blood, and made my Gods of golde; I haue caused the mothers wombes to bee their childrens tombes, cradles to swimme in blood like boates, and the temples of the Gods a stewes for strumpets. Haue not I made the sea to groane vnder the number of my ships: and haue they not perished, that there was not two left to make a number? Haue I not thrust my subiects into a Camp, like oxen into a Cart; whom hauing made slaues by vniust warres, I vse now as slaues for all warres? Haue not I entised the subiects of my neighbor Princes to destroy their natural Kings? like moaths that eate the cloth in which they were bred, like vipers that gnawe the bowels of which they were borne, and like woormes that consume the wood in which they were ingendred? To what kingdome haue not I pretended clayme? as though I had been by the Gods created heire apparant to the world, making euerie trifle a title; and all the territories about me, traitours to me. Why did I wish that all might bee gold I toucht, <pb xml:id="ep000141-013-a"/>but that I thought all mens hearts would bee touched with gold, that what pollicie could not compasse, nor prowes, gold might haue commaunded, and conquered. A bridge of gold did I mean to make in that Iland where all my nauie could not make a breach. Those Ilandes did I long to touch, that I might turne them to gold, and my selfe to glorie. But vnhappie Mydas, who by the same meanes perisheth himself, that he thought to conquere others: being now become a shame to the world, a scorne to that petie Prince, and to thy self a consumption. A petie Prince, Mydas? no, a Prince protected by the Gods, by Nature, by his own vertue, and his Subiects obedience.

In her faire lookes were his thoughts intangled, like the birdes of Canarie, that fal into a silken net. Dote he did without measure, and die he must without her loue.

Thy pipe a Nimph? some hag rather, hanting these shady groues, and desiring not thy loue, but the fellowship of such a monster.

Pan feeles the passions of loue deeply engrauen in his heart, with as faire Nimphs, with as great fortune, as Apollo, as Neptune, as Ioue; and better than Pan can none describe loue. Not Apollo, not Neptune, not Ioue. My Temple is in Arcadie, where they burne continuall flames to Pan. In Arcadie is mine Oracle, where Erato the Nymphe geeueth aunsweres for Pan. In Arcadie the place of Loue, is the honour of Pan. I but I am God of hilles.

So I am Apollo, of woods so thicke, that thou with thy beames canst not pierce them. I knew Apolloes prying, I knewe mine owne jealouzie. Sunne and shadow cousen one another. Be thou Sun still, the shadow is fast at thy heeles Apollo. I as neere to thy loue, as thou to mine. A Carter with his whistle &amp; his whip in true eare, mooues as much as Phoebus with his fierie chariot, and winged horses. Loue-leaues are as wel for countrie porridge, as heauenly nectar. Loue made Iupiter a goose, and Neptune a swine, and both for loue of an earthlie mistresse. What hath made Pan, or any God on earth (for gods on earth can change their shapes) turne themselues for an heauenly Goddesse? Beleeue me Apollo, our groues are pleasanter than your heauens, our Milk-maides than your Goddesses, our rude ditties to a pipe than your sonnets to a lute. Heere is flat faith amo amas; where you crie, ô vtinam amarent vel non amassem. I let passe (Apollo) thy hard words, as calling Pan monster; which is as much, as to call all monsters: for Pan is all, Apollo but one. But touch thy strings, and let these Nymphs decyde. </p>

            <p>I foresaw some old saw, which should be doutfull. Who would gad to such gods, that must be honored if they speake without sence: and the Oracle wondred at, as though it were aboue sence? </p>

            <p>No more Martius, I am the learnedst in Phrygia to interprete these Oracles and though shame hath hetherto caused me to conceale it, now I must vnfould it by necessitie. Thus destinie bringeth me, not only to be cause of all my shame, but reporter. Thou Sophronia, and you my Lordes, hearken; When I had bathed my self in Pactolus, and saw my wish to float in the waues, I wished the waues to ouerflow my bodie, so melancolie my fortune made me, so mad my follie: yet by hunting I thought to ease my heart. And comming at last to the hill Tmolus, I perceyued Apollo and Pan contending for excellencie in musick: among Nimphs they required also my iudgement. I (whom the losse of gold made discontent, and the possessing desperate) eyther <pb xml:id="ep000141-030-a"/>dulled with the humors of my weak brain, or deceaued by thicknes of my deaffe eares, preferd the harsh noyse of Pans pipe, before the sweete stroke of Apollos Lute, which caused Phoebus in iustice (as I now confesse, and then as I sawe in anger) to set these eares on my head, that haue wroong so many teares from mine eyes. For stretching my hands to Lesbos, I find that all the Gods haue spurnde at my practises, and those Ilandes scornd them. My pride the gods disdaine; my pollicie men: my mines haue bin emptied by souldiers, my souldiers spoyled by warres, my wars without successe, because vsurping, my vsurping without end, because my ambition aboue measure. I wil therfore yeeld my self to Bacchus, and acknowledge my wish to be vanitie. to Apollo, and confesse my iudgement to be foolish: to Mars, and say my warres are vniust: to Diana, and tell my affection hath been vnnaturall. And I doubt not, what a God hath done to make me know my selfe, al the gods wil help to vndo, that I may come to my selfe. </p>

That great Apollo, that ioynd to my head Asses eares, hath put into my heart a Lions minde. I see that by obscure shadows, which you cannot discerne in fresh colours. Apollo in the depth of his darke answere, is to mee the glistering of a bright sunne. I perceiue (and yet not too late) that Lesbos wil not be touched by gold, by force it cannot: that the Gods haue pitched it out of the world, as not to bee controlde by any in the world. Though my hande bee golde, yet I must not thinke to span ouer the maine Ocean. Though my souldiers be valiant, I must not therfore thinke my quarrels iust.
