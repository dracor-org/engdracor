The World tost at Tennis: How it will be now toss'd in the World, I know not; a toy brought to the Presse rather by the Printer, then the Poet; who requested an Epistle for his passe, to satisfie his perusers how hitherto hee hath behau'd himselfe. First, for his Conception; he was begot in Braine-ford, borne on the Bankeside of Hellicon, brought vp amongst Noble, Gentle, Commons, and good Schollers of all sorts, where (for his time) he did good and honest seruice beyond the small Seas; hee was <pb xml:id="ep000200-005-a"/>faire-spoken, neuer accus'd of scurrilous or obsceane language, (a vertue not euer found in Sceanes of the like condition) of as honest meaning reputed, as his words reported; neither too bitterly taxing, nor too soothingly telling the Worlds broad abuses, moderately merry, as sententiously serious, neuer condemn'd but for his breuitie in speech, euer wishing his Tale longer, to be assur'd he would continue to so good a purpose: Hauing all these hansome qualities simply and no other compounded with knauerie, there is great hope he shall passe still by the faire way of good report, perseuering in those honest courses which may become the sonne of Simplicitie: who, though he be now in a Masque, yet is his face apparant inough: and so (louing Cousins) hauing no Newes to send you at this time, but that Deceit is entring vpon you, (whom I pray you haue a care to auoid) and this notice I can giue you of him, there are some sixe or eight Pages before him; the Lawyer and the Diuell behinde him; in this care I leaue you, not leauing to be </p>
