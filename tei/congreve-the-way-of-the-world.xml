        <head>To the Right Honourable RALPH Earl of MOUNTAGUE, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>My LORD, </p>
        <p>WHether the World will arraign me of Vanity, or not, that I have presum'd to Dedicate this Comedy to your Lordship, I am yet in doubt: Tho' it may be it is some degree of Vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had the Honour of your Lordship's Conversation, cannot be suppos'd to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your Perusal: Yet it were to incur the Imputation of too much Sufficiency, to pretend to such a Merit as might abide the Test of your Lordship's Censure. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000492-004-a"/>
        <p>Whatever Value may be wanting to this Play while yet it is mine, will be sufficiently made up to it, when it is once become your Lordship's; and it is my Security, that I cannot have over-rated it more by my Dedication, than your Lordship will dignifie it by your Patronage. </p>
        <p>That it succeeded on the Stage, was almost beyond my Expectation; for but little of it was prepar'd for that general Taste which seems now to be predominant in the Pallats of our Audience. </p>
        <p>Those Characters which are meant to be ridiculous in most of our Comedies, are of Fools so gross, that in my humble Opinion, they should rather disturb than divert the well-natur'd and reflecting part of an Audience; they are rather Objects of Charity than Contempt; and instead of moving our Mirth, they ought very often to excite our Compassion. </p>
        <p>This Reflection mov'd me to design some Characters, which should appear ridiculous not so much thro' a natural Folly (which is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the Stage) as thro' an affected Wit; a Wit, which at the same time that it is affected, is also false. As there is some Difficulty in the formation of a Character of this Nature, so there is some Hazard which attends the progress of its Success, upon the Stage: For many come to a Play, so over-charg'd with Criticism, that they very often let fly their Censure, when through their rashness they have mistaken <pb xml:id="ep000492-004-b"/>their Aim. This I had occasion lately to observe: For this Play had been Acted two or three Days, before some of these hasty Judges cou'd find the leisure to distinguish betwixt the Character of a Witwoud and a Truewit. </p>
        <p>I must beg your Lordship's Pardon for this Digression from the true Course of this Epistle; but that it may not seem altogether impertinent, I beg, that I may plead the occasion of it, in part of that Excuse of which I stand in need, for recommending this Comedy to your Protection. It is only by the Countenance of your Lordship, and the Few so qualified, that such who write with Care and Pains can hope to be distinguish'd: For the Prostituted Name of Poet promiscuously levels all that bear it. </p>
        <p>Terence, the most correct Writer in the World, had a Scipio and a Lelius if not to assist him, at least to support him in his Reputation: And notwithstanding his extraordinary Merit, it may be, their Countenance was not more than necessary. </p>
        <p>The Purity of his Stile, the Delicacy of his Turns, and the Justness of his Characters, were all of them Beauties, which the greater part of his Audience were incapable of Tasting: Some of the coursest Strokes of Plautus, so severely censured by Horace, were more likely to affect the Multitude; such, who come with expectation to Laugh out the last Act of a Play, and are better entertained with two or three unseasonable <pb xml:id="ep000492-005-a"/>Jests, than with the artful Solution of the Fable. </p>
        <p>As Terence excell'd in his Performances, so had he great Advantages to encourage his Undertakings; for he built most on the Foundations of Menander: His Plots were generally modell'd, and his Characters ready drawn to his Hand. He, copied Menander; and Menander had no less Light in the Formation of his Characters, from the Observations of Theophrastus, of whom he was a Disciple; and Theopbrastus it is known was not only the Disciple, but the immediate Successor of Aristotle, the first and greatest Judge of Poetry. These were great Models to design by; and the further Advantage which Terence possess'd, towards giving his Plays the due Ornaments of Purity of Stile, and Justness of Manners, was not less considerable, from the freedom of Conversation, which was permitted him with Lelius and Scipio, two of the greatest and most polite Men of his Age. And indeed, the Privilege of such a Conversation, is the only certain Means of attaining to the Perfection of Dialogue. </p>
        <p>If it has hapned in any part of this Comedy, that I have gain'd a Turn of Stile, or Expression more Correct, or at least more Corrigible than in those which I have formerly written, I must, with equal Pride and Gratitude, ascribe it to the Honour of your Lordship's admitting me into <pb xml:id="ep000492-005-b"/>your Conversation, and that of a Society where every-body else was so well worthy of you, in your Retirement last Summer from the Town: For it was immediately after, that this Comedy was written. If I have fail'd in my Performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so many, not inferiour either to a Scipio or a Lelius, that there should be one wanting equal to the Capacity of a Terence. </p>
        <p>If I am not mistaken, Poetry is almost the only Art, which has not yet laid claim to your Lordship's Patronage. Architecture, and Painting, to the great Honour of our Country, have flourish'd under your Influence and Protection. In the mean time, Poetry, the eldest Sister of all Arts, and Parent of most, seems to have resign'd her Birth-right, by having neglected to pay her Duty to your Lordship; and by permitting others of a later Extraction, to prepossess that Place in your Esteem, to which none can pretend a better Title. Poetry, in its Nature, is sacred to the Good and Great; the relation between them is reciprocal, and they are ever propitious to it. It is the Privilege of Poetry to address to them, and it is their Prerogative alone to give it Protection. </p>
        <p>This receiv'd Maxim, is a general Apology for all Writers who Confecrate their Labours to great Men: But I could wish at this time, that this Address were exempted from the common pretence of all Dedications; and that as I <pb xml:id="ep000492-006-a"/>can distinguish your Lordship even among the most Deserving, so this Offering might become remarkable by some particular Instance of Respect, which shou'd assure your Lordship, that I am, with all due Sense of your extream Worthiness and Humanity, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE, </head>
        <p>Spoken by Mr. Betterton. </p>
        <lg>
          <l>OF those few Fools, who with ill Stars are curs'd, </l>
          <l>Sure scribbling Fools, call'd Poets, fare the worst. </l>
          <l>For they're a sort of Fools which Fortune makes, </l>
          <l>And after she has made 'em Fools, forsakes. </l>
          <l>With Nature's Oafs 'tis quite a diff'rent Case, </l>
          <l>For Fortune favours all her Idiot-Race: </l>
          <l>In her own Nest the Cuckow-Eggs we find, </l>
          <l>O'er which she broods to hatch the Changling-Kind. </l>
          <l>No Portion for her own she has to spare, </l>
          <l>So much she doats on her adopted Care. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Poets are Bubbles, by the Town drawn in, </l>
          <l>Suffer'd at first some tristing Stakes to win: </l>
          <l>But what unequal Hazards do they run! </l>
          <l>Each time they write, they venture all they've won: </l>
          <l>The 'Squire that's butter'd still, is sure to be undone. </l>
          <l>This Author, heretofore, has found your Favour, </l>
          <l>But pleads no Merit from his past Behaviour. </l>
          <l>To build on that might prove a vain Presumption, </l>
          <l>Should Grants to Poets made, admit Resumption: </l>
          <l>And in Parnassus he must lose his Seat, </l>
          <l>If that be found a forfeited Estate. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>He owns, with Toil, he wrought the following Scenes, </l>
          <l>But if they're naught ne're spare him for his Pains: </l>
          <l>Damn him the more; have no Commiseration </l>
          <l>For Dulness on mature Deliberation. </l>
          <l>He swears he'll not resent one hiss'd-off Scene, </l>
          <l>Nor, like those peevish Wits, his Play maintain, </l>
          <l>Who, to assert their Sense, your Taste arraign. </l>
          <l>Some Plot we think he has, and some new Thought; </l>
          <l>Some Humour too, no Farce; but that's a Fault. </l>
          <l>Satire, he thinks, you ought not to expect, </l>
          <l>For so Reform'd a Town, who dares Correct? </l>
          <l>To please, this time, has been his sole Pretence, </l>
          <l>He'll not instruct least it should give Offence. </l>
          <l>Should he by chance a Knave or Fool expose, </l>
          <l>That hurts none here, sure here are none of those. </l>
          <l>In short, our Play, shall (with your leave to shew it) </l>
          <l>Give you one Instance of a Passive Poet. </l>
          <l>Who to your Judgments yields all Resignation; </l>
          <l>So Save or Damn, after your own Discretion. </l>

              <p>And for a discerning Man, somewhat too passionate a Lover; for I like her with all her Faults; nay, like her for her Faults. Her Follies are so natural, or so artful, that they become her; and those Affectations which in another Woman wou'd be odious, serve but to make her more agreeable. I'll tell thee, Fainall, she once us'd me with that Insolence, that in Revenge I took her to pieces; sisted her and separated her Failings; I study'd 'em, and got 'em by rote. The Catalogue was so large, that I was not without hopes, one Day or other to hate her heartily: To which end I so us'd my self to think of 'em, that at length, contrary to my Design and Expectation, they gave me every Hour less and less disturbance; 'till in a few Days it became habitual to me, to remember 'em without being displeas'd. They are now grown as familiar to me as my own Frailties; and in all probability in a little time longer I shall like 'em as well. </p>

              <p>AY, ay, dear Marwood, if we will be happy, we must find the means in our selves, and among our selves. Men are ever in Extreams; either doating or averse. While they are Lovers, if they have Fire and Sense, their Jealousies are insupportable: And when they cease to Love, (we ought to think at least) they loath; they look upon us with Horror and Distaste; they meet us like the Ghosts of what we were, and as such fly from us. </p>

              <p>True, 'tis an unhappy Circumstance of Life, that Love shou'd ever die before us; and that the Man so often shou'd out-live the Lover. But say what you will, 'tis better to be left, than never to have been lov'd. To pass our Youth in dull Indifference, to refuse the Sweets of Life because they once must leave us; is as preposterous, as to wish to have been born Old, because we one Day must be Old. For my part, my Youth may wear and waste, but it shall never rust in my Possession. </p>

A Fellow that lives in a Windmill, has not a more whimsical Dwelling than the Heart of a Man that is lodg'd in a Woman. There is no Point of the Compass to which they cannot turn, and by which they are not turn'd; and by one as well as another; for Motion not Method is their Occupation. To know this, and yet continue to be in Love, is to be made wise from the Dictates of Reason, and yet persevere to play the Fool by the force of Instinct— O here come my pair of Turtles— What, billing so sweetly!

              <p>'Twere better so indeed. Or what think you of the Play-house? A fine gay glossy Fool, shou'd be given there, like a new masking Habit, after the Masquerade is over, and we have done with the Disguise. For a Fool's Visit is always a Difguise; and never admitted by a Woman of Wit, but to blind her Affair with a Lover of Sense. If you wou'd but appear bare fac'd now, and own Mirabell; you might as easily put off Petulant and Witwoud, as your Hood and Scarf. And indeed 'tis time, for the Town has found it: The Secret is grown too big for the Pretence: 'Tis like Mrs. Primly's great Belly; she may lace it down before, but it burnishes on her Hips. Indeed, Millamant, you can no more conceal it, then my Lady Strammel can her Face, that goodly Face, which in defiance of her Rhenish-wine Tea, will not be comprehended in a Mask. </p>
