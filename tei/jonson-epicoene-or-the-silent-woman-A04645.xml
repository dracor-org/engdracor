          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>MY hope is not so nourish'd by example, as it will conclude, this dumbe peece should please you, by cause it hath pleas'd others before: but by trust, that when you haue read it, you will find it worthy to haue dis-pleas'd none. This makes, that I now number you, not only in the Names of fauour, but the Names of iustice, to what I write; and doe, presently, call you to the exercise of that noblest, and manlyest vertue: as coueting rather to be freed in my fame, by the authoritie of a Iudge, then the credit of an Vndertaker. Reade therefore, I pray you, and censure. There is not a line, or syllable in it changed from the simplicitie of the first Copie. And, when you shall consider, through the certaine hatred of some, how much a mans innocency may bee indanger'd by an vncertaine accusation; you will, I doubt not, so beginne to hate the iniquitie of such natures, as I shall loue the contumely done me, whose end was so honorable, as to be wip'd off by your sentence. </p>

            <l>TRuth sayes, of old, the art of making Playes </l>
            <l>Was to content the people; and their prayse </l>
            <l>Was to the Poet money, wine, and bayes. </l>
            <l>But in this age, a sect of Writers are, </l>
            <l>That, onely, for particular likings care, </l>
            <l>And will taste nothing that is populare. </l>
            <l>With such we mingle neither braynes, nor brests; </l>
            <l>Our wishes, like to those (make publike feasts) </l>
            <l>Are not to please the Cookes tastes, but the guests. </l>
            <l>Yet, if those cunning palates hether come, </l>
            <l>They shall find guests entreatie, and good roome; </l>
            <l>And though all rellish not, sure, there will be some, </l>
            <l>That, when they leaue their seates, shall make 'hem say, </l>
            <l>Who wrote that piece, could so haue wrote a Play: </l>
            <l>But that, he knew, this was the better way. </l>
            <l>For, to present all Custard, or all Tart, </l>
            <l>And haue no other meats, to beare a part, </l>
            <l>Or to want bread, and salt, were but course art. </l>
            <l>The Poet prayes you then, with better thought </l>

Alas, Sir, doe you euer thinke to find a chaste Wife, in these times? now? when there are so many Masques, Playes, Puritane Preachings, Mad-folkes, and other strange fights to be seene daily, priuate and publique? if you had liu'd in King Etheldred's time, Sir, or Edward the Confessors, you might, perhaps haue found in some cold Countrey-Hamlet, then, a dull frostrie Wench, would haue beene contented with one man: now, they will as soone be pleas'd with one legge, or one eye.

If fruitfull, as proud as May, and humorous as April; she must haue her Doctors, her Mid-wiues, her Nurses, her longings euerie houre: though it be for the dearest morsell of man. If learned, there was neuer such a Parrat; all your Patrimonie will be too little for the Guests, that must be inuited, to heare her speake Latine and Greeke: and you must lye with her in those Languages too, if you will please her. If precise, you must feast all the silenc'd Brethren, once in three dayes; salute the Sisters; entertayne the whole Family, or Wood of 'hem; and heare long-winded Exercises, Singings, and Catechisings, which you are not giuen to, and yet must giue for: to please the zealous Matron your Wife, who, for the holy cause, will cosen you, ouer and aboue.

              <p>Admirable Creature! I will trouble you no more: I will not sinne against so sweet a simplicity. Let me now be bold to print, on those diuine lips, the seale of being mine. Cutberd, I giue thee the Lease of thy House free: thanke me not, but with thy legge(—) I know what thou wouldst say, she's poore, and her friends deceased; she has brought a wealthy dowrie in her silence, Cutberd: and in respect of her pouertie, Cutberd, I shall haue her more louing, and obedient, Cutberd. Goe thy wayes, and get me a Minister presently, with a soft, low voyce to marry vs, and pray him he will not be impertinent, but briefe as he can; away: softly, Cutberd. Sirrah, conduct your Mistris into the dining Roome, your now-Mistris. O my felicity! how I shall bee reueng'd on mine insolent Kinsman, and his plots to fright mee from marrying! This night I will get an Heire, and thrust him out of my bloud like a Stranger; hee would bee knighted, forsooth, and thought by that meanes to raigne ouer mee, his Title must doe it: no Kinsman, I will now make you <pb xml:id="ep000107-019-a"/>bring me the tenth Lords, and the sixteenth Ladies Letter, Kinsman; and it shall doe you no good, Kinsman. Your Knight-hood it selfe shall come on it's knees, and it shall bee reiected; it shall bee sued for it's fees to execution, and not be redeem'd; it shall cheat at the twelue-peny Ordinary, it Knight-hood, for it's Dyet all the Terme-time, and tell Tales for it in the Vacation, to the Hostesse: or it Knight-hood shall doe worse; take Sanctuary in Cole-harbor, and fast. It shall fright all it friends, with borrowing Letters, and when one of the foure-score hath brought it Knight-hood tenne shillings, it Knight-hood shall go to the Cranes, or the Beare at the Bridge-foot, and be drunke in feare: it shall not haue money to discharge one Tauerne reckoning, to inuite the old Creditors, to forbeare it Knight-hood; or the new, that should bee, to trust it Knight-hood. It shall bee the tenth name in the Bond, to take vp the commodity of Pipkins and stone Iugs; and the part thereof shall not furnish it Knight-hood forth, for the attempting of a Bakers Widdow, a brown Bakers Widdow. It shall giue it Knight-hoods name, for a stallion, to all gamesome Citizens Wiues, and bee refus'd; when the Master of a Dauncing Schoole, or (How doe you call him) the worst Reueller in the Towne is taken: it shall want Clothes, and by reason of that, wit, to foole to Lawyers. It shall not haue hope to repaire it selfe by Constantinople, Ireland, or Virginia; but the best, and last fortune to it Knight-hood shall bee, to make Dol Teare-sheet, or Kate-Common, a Lady: and so, it Knight-hood may eate. </p>

              <p>'Tis true. No more then all Birds, or all Fishes. If you appeare learned to an ignorant Wench, or iocund to a sad, or witty to a foolish, why shee presently beginnes to mistrust herselfe. You must approch them i' their owne height, their owne line: for the contrary makes many that feare to commit themselues to noble and worthy fellowes, runne into the imbraces of a Rascall. If she loue Wit, giue Verses, though you borrow 'hem of a friend, or buy 'hem, to haue good. If Valour, talke of your Sword, and be frequent in the mention of Quarrels, though you be staunch in fighting. If actiuity be seen o'your Barbary often, or leaping ouer stooles, for the credit of your back. If she loue good clothes or dressing haue your learned Counsel about you euery morning, your French Taylor, Barber, Linnener, &amp;c. Let your Poulder, your Glasse, and your Combe, be your dearest acquaintance. Take more care for the ornament of your head, then the safetie: and wish the Common-wealth rather troubled, then a haire about you. That will take her. Then if shee bee couetous and crauing, doe you promise any thing, and performe sparingly: so shall you keepe her in appetite still. Seeme as you would giue, but be like a barren field that yeelds little, or vnlucky Dice, to foolish, and hoping Gamesters. Let your gifts be flight, and daintie, ra her then precious. Let cunning be aboue cost. Giue Cherries at time of yeere, or Apricots; and say they were sent you out of the Countrey, though you bought 'hem in Cheap-side. Admire her Tyres; like her in all fashions; compare her in euery habit to some Deitie; inuent excellent Dreames to flatter her, and Riddles; or, if shee bee a great one, performe alwayes the second <pb xml:id="ep000107-029-b"/>parts to her: like what she likes, prayse whom shee prayses, and faile not to make the Houshold and Seruants yours, yea the whole Family, and salute 'hem by their names: ('tis but light cost if you can purchase 'hem so) and make her Physician your Pensioner, and her chiefe woman. Nor will it bee out of your gaine to make loue to her too, so she follow, not vsher, her Ladies pleasure. All blabbing is taken away, when she comes to be a part of the crime. </p>

So that I come not to your publike pleadings, or your places of noyse; not that I neglect those things, that make for the dignitie of the Common-wealth: but for the meere auoyding of clamours, and impertinences of Orators, that know not how to bee silent.

You meant so, I am sure? But, that wee haue stuck it vpon you to day, in your owne imagin'd persons, and so lately; this Amazon, the Champion of the sexe, should beat you now thriftily, for the common slanders, which Ladies receiue from such Cuckowes, as you are. You are they, that when no merit or fortune can make you hope to enioy their bodies, will yet lye with their reputations, and make their fame suffer. Away you common Moths of these, and all Ladies honours, Goe, trauaile to make legges and faces, <pb xml:id="ep000107-051-b"/>and come home with some new matter to be laught at: you deserue to liue in an Ayre as corrupted, as that wherewith you feed rumour. Madames, you are mute, vpon this new Metamorphosis! but here stands she, that has vindicated your fames. Take heed of such insectae hereafter. And let it not trouble you that you haue discouer'd any Mysteries to this yong Gentleman. He is (a'most) of yeeres, and will make a good Visitant within this twelue-month. In the meane time, wee'l all vndertake for his secrecie, that can speake so well of his silence. Spectators, if you like this Comoedie, rise cheerfully, and now Morose is gone in, clap your hands. It may bee, that noyse will cure him, at least please him. </p>
