              <l>Wise men euer doo. It is a fault, </l>
              <l>A foolish tricke, all to refuse for one. </l>
              <l>What one cannot, many can well performe: </l>
              <l>Some serue, some giue, some fit for other vse. </l>

              <l>Of a great Lady learnd the Art of loue. </l>
              <l>Corisca would she say. Let thy </l>
              <l>Louers and thy garments be alike. </l>
              <l>Haue many, vse, weare but one, and change often. </l>
              <l>Too much conuersing breedeth noysomenesse, </l>

              <l>We cannot worser do, then fill our friends, </l>
              <l>Let them go hungry rather from thee still. </l>
              <l>So did I alwaies, alwaies louing store, </l>

              <l>Sigh for my selfe, deceiuing no man else. </l>
              <l>Now must I robbe my limmes of their repose, </l>
              <l>Mine eyes of sleepe, and watch the breake of day: </l>
              <l>Now do I wander through these shadow'd woods, </l>
              <l>Seeking the footsteps of my hated loue. </l>
              <pb xml:id="ep000047-010-b"/>
              <l>What must Corisca do? shall I entreat him? </l>
              <l>No: my hate not giues me leaue. Ile giue him o're, </l>
              <l>Nor will my loue consent. What shall I do? </l>
              <l>Prayers and subtilties I will attempt: </l>
              <l>I will bewray my loue, but not as mine, </l>
              <l>If this preuaile not, then Ile make disdaine </l>

              <l>T'is not in them now faith with faith to grace, </l>
              <l>And to contend in loue with him that loues, </l>
              <l>Into two breasts diuiding but one will: </l>
              <l>Now all their labour is, with burnish'd gold </l>
              <l>To die their haire, and tye it vp in curles, </l>

              <l>O what a stinking thing it is, to see them take </l>

              <l>The blacke seeme white, faults mending with farre worse. </l>
              <l>Then with a paire of pincers do they pull </l>

              <l>True faith to hate, worser then death it selfe: </l>
              <l>These be the trickes that make loue so peruerse. </l>
              <l>Then is the fault faithlesse Corisca thine? </l>
              <l>Or rather mine, that haue beleeu'd thee so? </l>
              <l>How many troubles haue I for thy sake sustaind? </l>

              <l>Louers beleeue me, women once ador'd, </l>
              <l>Are worser then the griefly powers of hell. </l>
              <l>Strait by their valure vaunt they that they are </l>

              <l>Let go these base● sighes, praiers and plaints, </l>
