        <head>TO HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS Prince Rupert. </head>
        <p>MY ambition of dedicating this to your Royal Highness, proceeds not from the more than ordinary encouragement it receiv'd from you, when it appear'd on the Stage: tho' of thirty times it has been acted, you seldom fail'd to honour it with your presence. 'Twould be presumption in me to examine why you did it that Grace; and vain-glory to attribute it to the merits of the Play, since the best have not receiv'd the like honour. </p>
        <p>Nor does the envie of Criticks force me to invoke your Princely Patronage; it were as vain to think the name of a Patron should shield it from their censures, as it would hinder the rude rable (if engrav'd on the front of a house) from breaking the windows. The malice of these, and the rudeness of the others may lead 'em to do either, without convincing them they are guilty of any disrespect. And Criticks stand up as zealously for the liberty of their Tongues, as Fanaticks for liberty of Conscience; and rail as spitefully against Plays, as that perverse Generation does against Magistrates and Governours. </p>
        <p>The third common pretence of Authors I likewise disown: I boast not of any particular favours receiv'd; blessings flow from Princes, as light does from the Sun, which shines on all at once. They oblige not Persons, but Nations: Of that great Vertue, SIR, you stand a glorious Example. You engag'd your self in our intestine dissentions: You was the thunderbolt of War; the enemies where-ever you came, or fled or fell before you: You threw your self into the storm to <pb xml:id="ep000641-003-a"/>save us; and when it had shipwrack'd the best of Monarchs, your Piety led you to exile with the Son: when his Country and Subjects forsook him, you did not; but with him shar'd the dangers and hardships of banishment, till Heaven (which laid the yoke of tyranny for punishment on our rebellious necks) was pleas'd to restore him to us, or rather us to our King. The Sun had it been so long absent, could not be more welcome; with him like a train of glorious Lights, return'd the Royal Family, and not long after your Royal Self; after you you drew a chain of Blessings, Freedom, Peace, Religion, Unity, which ever since we have enjoyed: What foes we have abroad, we need not fear, whilst we have your Counsel for Conduct, and your Sword for Execution. You still like Englands Angel Guardian stand ready to defend it; and so long as we have either Memory or Gratitude, every tongue must speak your fame, and every heart dedicate it self to you as a Trophee, owing to your gallantry. What a noble stock of Virtue must you have so entirely to captivate the hearts of a Nation, to which you was born a stranger! Who, when they hear your name, or see it here prefixt, will not repeat it, and say, You are the Heroe of the world; then in a transport run o'er your mighty Deeds and Actions, which make you famous above mankind in our present Annals, and will with excess of Glory bear your name to after Ages? How just an occasion have I here, to say all that can be said of man without danger of being thought a flatterer? But, Sir, were you less than what you are, I could say more: Now all is truth, nor can that truth be contain'd in an Epistle. And I know the perfect Heroe blushes as much at the narration of his Virtues, as the Lady exactly Beautiful at the relation of her Perfections: Praise seems to lessen both, for 'tis thought we rather speak what they should be, than what they are. Virtue ought to find Imitators, and Beauty more admirers than commenders: Nor would I give the most malicious any ground to think you can be flatter'd; or that I hope by flattery and insinuation to make attonement for this presumption: Your Virtues drew it on you; those Virtues <pb xml:id="ep000641-003-b"/>which have so much oblig'd our Nation, engage all hearts to pay our thanks as tribute to you: Involv'd in the common fate, I take this occasion to attest my acknowledgements, and to beg your Royal Highness to look upon this, not so much the Dedication of a Play, as of a Heart. That other Poets stand at an awful distance, argues not my rudeness, but the greatness of my zeal which prompts me to believe that the boldness of performing so great a Duty, is not a crime equal to the forbearance; And I shall account it my glory to have led the way, where others made a stand. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>GAllants you're so unconstant grown of late, </l>
          <l>That Plays and Mistrisses have the same fate; </l>
          <l>For both with you grow quickly out of date. </l>
          <l>Each with variety so taken is, </l>
          <l>You'l see but once or the same Play or Miss. </l>
          <l>Go on, we'l not your liberty retrench, </l>
          <l>Like this for change▪ as you wou'd do a wench: </l>
          <l>But know, when the translating vein is past, </l>
          <l>That you must not expect new Plays so fast. </l>
          <l>Then Wit and sence will come into request, </l>
          <l>And something more than a vain Fopp well dress'd. </l>
          <l>The Taylor now in Plays makes the best jest. </l>
          <l>And 'twill be time to check this full carreer </l>
          <l>Of Plays, and Act but two or three a year. </l>
          <l>With plenty you are cloy'd, but when grown scarce </l>
          <l>You will esteem 'em more; and then a Farce </l>
          <l>Will entertain you for a Month at least; </l>
          <l>Not what is good, but scarce does make a feast. </l>
          <l>Then shall the Knight that had a knock in's Cradle, </l>
          <l>Such as Sir Martin, or Sir <hi>Arthur Addle</hi>, </l>
          <l>Be flock'd unto, as the great Heroes now </l>
          <l>In Playes of Rhyme and Noyse with wond'rous show. </l>
          <l>Then shall the House (to see these Hectors kill and slay, </l>
          <l>That bravely fight out the whole plot of th' Play,) </l>
          <l>Be for at least six months full ev'ry day. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>If beauty grows so scarce, your Misses too </l>
          <l>Will find that you'l to them more constant grow. </l>
          <l>Now the enjoy'd you slight; if you're inclin'd </l>
          <l>To visit them, it is not to be kind. </l>
          <l>You play the criticks, you find fault and jeer, </l>
          <l>And 'gainst your Miss are wittily severe; </l>
          <l>As fain you'd be on Plays when you come here. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000641-004-b"/>
          <l>You like prejudicated Iudges sit; </l>
          <l>There Beauties faults you find, here those of Wit.. </l>
        </lg>

        <lg>
          <l>FRom the Court party we hope no success, </l>
          <l>Our Author is not one of the Nobless, </l>
          <l>That bravely does maintain his Miss in Town, </l>
          <l>Whilst my great Lady is with speed sent down, </l>
          <l>And forc'd in Country Mansion house to fix, </l>
          <l>That Miss may rattle here in Coach and six. </l>
          <l>If one of these the Author was, perchance </l>
          <l>You'd joyn your int'rest, and the Play advance: </l>
          <l>For tho' you great ones and you Courtiers be </l>
          <l>Not o'er good natur'd, you've civilitie. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Nor is he one you call a Town-Gallant, </l>
          <l>Who for fine cloathes does seldom money want: </l>
          <l>But drives at cheaper rates the sinful trade, </l>
          <l>Seduces Wives, sometimes a Chamber-maid: </l>
          <l>That at Jero's or Satt'lins goes to dinner; </l>
          <l>And thence repairs to th' Play to meet a sinner: </l>
          <l>And here with Burgundy and brisk sableé </l>
          <l>Inspir'd, with vizard-Masque holds reparteé. </l>
          <l>After the Play in joulting Hack he goes, </l>
          <l>Where his companions have their Rendevouz. </l>
          <l>In pairs they meet; and <hi>Ala mode </hi>of France </l>
          <l>They sup, they have the fiddles too and dance: </l>
          <l>Tow'rds morning, when they think of going home, </l>
          <l>Each Gallant on a Couch in the next room, </l>
          <l>In's turn, takes gentle solace with his Punk; </l>
          <l>Drops her a Guinney, and sends her home half drunk. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>All of that Gang by this confession too </l>
          <l>Are lost. Ladies, our Author trusts in you. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000641-005-a"/>
          <l>He is a man as modest for his age, </l>
          <l>As most you've seen, who know him dare engage </l>
          <l>That he has kept 'till now his pusillage. </l>
          <l>But alas! the world to that pass is grown, </l>
          <l>The modish women are asham'd to own </l>
          <l>A sober man: to like his Play will be, </l>
          <l>As great a scandal as his companie. </l>
          <l>For he observes, and it is very true, </l>
          <l>That modesty's not much approv'd in you. </l>
          <l>And is of late so out of fashion grown, </l>
          <l>She that is honest scarcely dares it own. </l>
          <l>But does, howe'er her mind affected is, </l>
          <l>Put on the brisk gay carriage of a Miss. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But Ladies, hope the Poet one day may </l>
          <l>Converted be; for he that writes a Play, </l>
          <l>If not debauch'd, yet is in a fair way. </l>
          <l>To gain your favours he resolves to be </l>
          <l>In all the Town the greatest debaucheé: </l>
          <l>And in a very little time may grow </l>
          <l>Debauch'd enough to be asham'd of you. </l>

A servant chanc'd to leave open the door of the Room where he was at supper; looking in, I saw him sit at table with his Hostess, who was a notable fat burley Dame; he not being well after his journey, bespoak a Sack-posset, and invited her to the eating of it. </p>

            <p>Twas thus. One leg with a slipper at the end of it (and that no very cleanly one) was laid upon one corner of the Table, the other in her lap, his left arm about her neck, embracing: in this manner he sat for some time, telling her the occasion of his coming to Town; that it was love▪ that his Mistress was such a one (naming you, Madam). His hostess to gratifie the relation he had made her, drank your health to him in the posset, he went to pledge it, but was taken in the middle of his draught with a coughing and sneezing, which broak out with such a violence, that all he had drank flew out at his nose and mouth into his Land-ladies face; she making a start from her chair threw him backward, he keeps his hold, draws her after him; down comes she, the posset between 'em, and her coats over 'em. A terrible out-cry there was, and I ran in amongst the rest to help: when with much ado we had found the way to take her off the right end upward, there we saw Sir Simon lying half drown'd in posset, and half smother'd with Petty coats. </p>

            <p>This Hypochondriack Melancholy proceeds from the deprav'd constitution of some part of the neather belly, and inferiour region: but particularly from the spleen. To be assured that this is his disease, you need but observe this great dulness which you see, this heaviness accompanied with fear and diffidence, signs, pathognomiques and individuals of this disease so well observed by the divine Hippocrates; this Physiognomy, these eyes, red, heavy and dull; this grisly beard, and grumness; this swarthy, tawney complexion; this constitution of body, lean, spare and haggord, rough, black and hairy; all which signs denote him to be very much o'ercome with this disease proceeding from the depravedness of the Hypochondria. </p>

            <p>Now I mean to touch the Therapeia, and remedies which ought to be prescribed to effect a perfect cure. First, then to remedy this Plethora, and this Cacochymia, or general depravation of humours throughout all the body; my advice is for Phlebotomy; that he bleed freely; that is to say, plentifully; first of the Basilick, then of the Cephalick vein; and if the disease prove obstinate and refractory, that a vein be opened in his forehead, and that the orifice be very large, that the thick corrupted bloud may have passage; and at the same time that he purge, deopitulate and evacuate by proper and convenient purgations; that is to say, by Cholagogues, Melanogogues, &amp;c. But before all these, I find it meet to exhilarate his spirits with harmony resulting from Musick instrumental and vocal, with which it will not be amiss to joyn some Dancers; to the end that their motions, postures, and agility of bodies, may excite, stirr up, and quicken his spirits stupified with idleness, which occasions the thickness of his bloud, from whence proceeds the Malady: these are the Remedies I prescribe, which may be much advantag'd by some others of yours much better and more efficacious, <pb n="45" xml:id="ep000641-027-b"/>having by your daily practice gain'd great experience, judgement and knowledge in our Art.
