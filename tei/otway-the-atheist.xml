     TO THE LORD ELANDE, Eldest Son to the Right Honourable the Marquiss of Hallifax.
    </head>
    <opener>
     <salute>
      My Lord,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     IT was not without a great deal of debate with my self, that I could resolve to make this Present to Your Lordship: For though Epistles Dedicatory be lately grown so Epidemical, that either sooner or later, no man of Quality (whom the least Author has the least pretence to be troublesome to) can escape them; yet methought Your Lordship should be as much above the common Perplexities that attend Your Quality, as You are above the common Level of it, as well in the most Exalted Degrees of a Noble Generous Spirit, as in a piercing Apprehension, good Understanding, and daily ripening Judgment, all sweetned by an obliging Affability and Condescention; of which I have often, in the Honour of Your Conversation, had particular cause to be proud; and for which therefore, a more than ordinary reason, now, to be Grateful.
    </p>
    <p>
     And it is upon that pretence, I here presume to shelter this Trifle under Your Protection; for indeed, it has great need of such Protection: having at its first coming into the World met with many Enemies, and
     <pb xml:id="ep000661-003-a"/>
     very industrious ones too; but this way I was sure it must live:
     <hi>
      Would He but once vouchsafe to espouse its Defence, whose Generosity will overthrow the ignoblest Envy; whose good Nature, cannot but confound the most inveterate Malice; and whose Wit must baffle the sauciest Ignorance.
     </hi>
    </p>
    <p>
     <hi>
      My Lord
     </hi>
     , It would but argue me of the meanest Impertinence and Formality, to pretend here an Harangue of those Praises You deserve: For he who tells the World whose Son You are, has said enough to those who do not know You; and the happy few, whom You have pick'd and chosen for Your Conversation, cannot but every hour You are pleased to bestow upon them, be sensible of more than I could tell them in a Volume: Your Lordship being the best Panegyrick upon Your self; the Son of that Great Father of his Country, who when all manner of Confusion, Ruin, and Destruction, was breaking in upon us, like the Guardian Angel of these Kingdoms, stood up; and with the Tongue of an Angel too, confounded the Subtleties of that Infernal Serpent, who would have debauched us from our Obedience, and turned our Eden into a Wilderness. Certainly His Name must be for ever Honourable, Precious His Memory, and Happy His Generation, who durst exert his Loyalty, when it was grown almost a reproach to have any, and stem a torrent of Faction, popular Fury, and fermenting Rebellion, to the Preserving of the best of Kings in his Throne, and the happiest of People in their Liberties.
    </p>
    <p>
     May he live long to compleat the Reparations he
     <pb xml:id="ep000661-003-b"/>
     has made in our Defence; still by the strength of his Judgment, to foresee those Evils that may yet threaten us, and by the Power of his Wisdom to prevent them; to root out the Footing and Foundations of the Kings open (nay, and bosome) Enemies: As a watchful, bold, and sincere Counsellor to his Master; to be a driver of Treacherous, Grinning, Self-ended Knaves, Insinuating Spies, and useless unprofitable Fools from his Service: A Patron and and Promoter of Honesty, Merit, and Ability, which else too often, by neglect, are corrupted to their Contraries.
    </p>
    <p>
     In fine, to continue (as he is) a kind Indulgent Father to Your Lordship, so much every way his Son, and fit to Inherit his Honours, as in the strong and shining Virtues of Your Mind, the fixt and steady disposition of Your Loyalty, the goodness and obliging temper of Your Nature, is apparent; by which only I must ever humbly confess, and no presumptive Merit of my own, I have been incouraged to take this Opportunity of telling the World how much I desire to be thought,

     PROLOGUE.
    </head>
    <l>
     THough Plays and Prologues ne'er did more abound,
    </l>
    <l>
     Ne'er were
     <hi>
      good Prologues
     </hi>
     harder to be found.
    </l>
    <l>
     To me the Cause seems eas'ly understood:
    </l>
    <l>
     For there are Poets prove not
     <hi>
      very good
     </hi>
     ,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who, like base Sign-Post Dawbers, wanting Skill,
    </l>
    <l>
     Steal from Great Masters Hands, and Copy ill.
    </l>
    <l>
     Thus, if by chance, before a Noble Feast
    </l>
    <l>
     Of Gen'rous Wit, to whet and fit your Taste,
    </l>
    <l>
     Some poignant Satyr in a Prologue rise,
    </l>
    <l>
     And growing Vices handsomly chastise;
    </l>
    <l>
     Each Poetaster thence presumes on Rules,
    </l>
    <l>
     And ever after calls ye downright Fools.
    </l>
    <l>
     These Marks describe him.&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Writing by rote; Small Wit, or none to spare;
    </l>
    <l>
     Iangle and Chime's his Study, Toil, and Care:
    </l>
    <l>
     He always in One Line upbraids the Age;
    </l>
    <l>
     And a good Reason why; it Rymes to Stage.
    </l>
    <l>
     With Wit and Pit he keeps a hideous pother;
    </l>
    <l>
     Sure to be damn'd by One, for want of T'other:
    </l>
    <l>
     But if, by chance, he get the French Word Raillery,
    </l>
    <l>
     Lord, how he fegues the Vizor-Masques with Gallery!
    </l>
    <l>
     'Tis said, Astrologers strange Wonders find

    <l>
     Vast Deluges of Dulness were foretold.

     <hi>
      Politick Ditties
     </hi>
     , full of Sage Debate,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Merry Catches, how to
     <hi>
      Rule the State.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     Vicars neglect their Flocks, to turn Translators,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Barley-water Whey-fac'd Beau's write Satyrs;
    </l>
    <l>
     Though none can guess to which most Praise belongs,
    </l>
    <l>
     To the Learn'd
     <hi>
      Versions, Scandals
     </hi>
     , or the Songs.
    </l>
    <l>
     For all things now by Contraries succeed;
    </l>
    <l>
     Of Wit or Vertue there's no longer need:
    </l>
    <l>
     Beauty submits to him who loudliest rails;
    </l>
    <pb xml:id="ep000661-004-b"/>
    <l>
     She fears the sawcie Fop, and he prevails.
    </l>
    <l>
     Who for his best Preferment would devise,
    </l>
    <l>
     Let him renounce all Honesty, and rise.
    </l>
    <l>
     Villains and Parasites Success will gain;
    </l>
    <l>
     But in the Court of Wit, shall Dulness Reign?
    </l>
    <l>
     No: Let th' angry 'Squire give his Iambicks o're,
    </l>
    <l>
     Twirl Crevat-strings, but write Lampoons no more;
    </l>
    <l>
     Rhymesters get Wit, e'er they pretend to shew it,
    </l>
    <l>
     Nor think a Game at Cramboe makes a Poet:
    </l>
    <l>
     Else is our Author hopeless of Success,
    </l>
    <l>
     But then his Study shall be next time less:
    </l>
    <l>
     He'll find out Ways to your Applause, more easie;
    </l>
    <l>
     That is, write worse and worse, till he can please ye.

    </head>
    <l>
     IT is not long since in the Noisie Pit
    </l>
    <l>
     Tumultuous Faction sate the Iudge of Wit;
    </l>
    <l>
     There Knaves applauded what their Blockheads writ.
    </l>
    <l>
     At a Whig-Brother's Play, the Bawling Crowd
    </l>
    <l>
     Burst out in Shouts, as zealous, and as loud,
    </l>
    <l>
     As when some Member's stout Election-Beer
    </l>
    <l>
     Gains the
     <hi>
      mad Voice
     </hi>
     of a whole
     <hi>
      Drunken Shire
     </hi>
     .
    </l>
    <l>
     And yet, even then, our Poet's Truth was try'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     Tho 'twas a Dev'lish pull to stem the Tyde;
    </l>
    <l>
     And tho he ne'er did Line of Treason write,
    </l>
    <l>
     Nor made one Rocket on Queen Besse's Night,
    </l>
    <l>
     Such was his Fortune, or so good his Cause,
    </l>
    <l>
     Even then he fail'd not wholly of Applause.
    </l>
    <l>
     He that could then escape, now bolder grows:
    </l>
    <l>
     Since the Whig-Tyde runs out, the Loyal flows.
    </l>
    <l>
     All you who lately here presum'd to bawl,
    </l>
    <l>
     Take warning from your Brethren at Guild-hall:
    </l>
    <l>
     The
     <hi>
      Spirit of Rebellion
     </hi>
     there is quell'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     And here your
     <hi>
      Poet's Acts
     </hi>
     are all repeal'd:
    </l>
    <l>
     Impartial Justice has resum'd agen
    </l>
    <l>
     Her awful Seat, nor bears the Sword in vain.
    </l>
    <l>
     The Stage shall lash the Follies of the Times,
    </l>
    <l>
     And the
     <hi>
      Laws Vengeance
     </hi>
     overtake the Crimes.

      Ay, Sir; and I thank you, the next thing you did, was, you begot me; the Consequence of which was as follows: As soon as I was born, you sent me to Nurse, where I suckt two years at the dirty Dugs of a foul-feeding Witch, that liv'd in a thatch't Sty upon the neighb'ring Common; as soon as I was big enough, that you might be rid of me, you sent me to a Place call'd a School, to be slash't and box't by a thick-fisted Blockhead, that could not read himself; where I learnt no Letters, nor got no Meat, but such as the old Succubus his Wife bought at a stinking Price, so over-run with Vermin, that it us'd to crawl home after her.

Why thou wilt be a damnable rich Rogue now, if thou dost not marry; though I know thou wilt live bravely and deliciously, eat and drink nobly, have always half a dozen honest, jolly, true-spirited, spritely Friends about thee, and so forth, hah! Then for Marriage, to speak the truth on't, it is at the best but a chargeable, vexatious, uneasie sort of Life; it ruin'd me, Iack, utterly ruin'd thy poor old Father, Iack.

      Take a hundred Guinea's out of the Cabinet, and carry 'em after the Old Gentleman to his Place of Rendezvous. This Father of mine (Heav'n be thanked) is a very ungodly Father&#9642; He was in his&#9642; Youth just such another wicked Fellow as his Son Iohn here; but he had no Estate, there I have the better of him: for out of meer Opinion of my Good-husbandry, my Uncle thought fit to disinherit the extravagant Old Gentleman, and leave all to me. Then he was married, there I had the better of him again; yet he married a Fortune of Ten thousand pound, and before I was Seven years old, had broke my Mothers Heart, and spent three parts of her Portion: Afterwards he was pleas'd to retain a certain Familiar Domestick, call'd a House-keeper, which I one day, to shew my Breeding, call'd Whore, and was fairly turn'd a starving for it. Now he has no way to squeeze me out of Contribution, but by taking up his Fatherly Authority, and offering to put the Penal Law call'd Marriage in execution. I must e'en get him a Governour, and send him with a Pension into the Country: Ay, it must be so; For, Wedlock, I deny thee; Father, I'll supply thee; and, Pleasure, I will have thee. Who's there?

      In short, to give you one infallible Argument, that I never will marry, I have been married already, that is, sold: for being the Daughter of a very rich Merchant, who dying left me the onely Heiress of an immense Fortune, it was my ill luck to fall into the Hands of Guardians, that, to speak properly, were Raskals; for in a short time they conspired amongst themselves, and for base Bribes, betray'd, sold, and married me to a&#8212; Husband, that's all.

Wherefore, for a little present diversion, I have contrived a Letter in an unknown name, by this young Agent here, and convey'd it to thy lewd Husband, with another in my own to Beaugard; and sent for thee, my Dear, to share in the pleasure of the Consequence.

Nay, they are already half disposed to run away themselves; for by my Womans interest in the Chirurgeon, who has care of the swearing Atheistical Fellow, yesterday hurt in the scuffle, and afterwards conveyed hither, he gives it out, that he fears his Wounds may be mortal. Upon which, my Lover Gratian sighs, and turns up his Eyes like a Godly Brother at Exercise. My Brother Theodoret puffs, swells, grinds his Teeth, and stamps as if he would brain himself against the next Wall; while poor Beaugard's ne'er be good Father has, with pure fear, lost a red Nose that has been his fast Friend for these 40 years; and every time he sees his Face in a Glass, fancies every Wrinkle there has the shape of a Gibbet.
