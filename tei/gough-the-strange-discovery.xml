I knewe the reason, because I looked sted fastlie upon the picture of Andromeda naked, and by that meanes, conceived a thing like to her, yet I determined to rid my selfe of shamefull death (counting it certaine that thy colour would procure me to be accused of adulterie, and that none would believe me when I told them the cause) and to commit thee to the unstablenes of fortune, which is a great deale rather to be wished for then present death, or to be called a bastard: and telling my husband that thou wert straight dead, I have privilie layd thee forth with the greatest riches that I had for a reward to him that shall find thee and take thee up: above all thinges remember that thou seeke among thy jewels for a certaine ring, which thy father gave me when we were first made sure, in the hoope whereof is a princelie posie, the stone is a Pantarbe of secret vertue, consecrated in the place where it is set.
