        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <l>HE who comes hither with design to hiss, </l>
        <l>And with a Bum reverst to whisper Miss; </l>
        <l>To comb a Perriwigg, or to show gay Cloaths; </l>
        <l>Or to vent Antick nonsence with new Oaths, </l>
        <l>Our Poet welcomes as the Muses Friend, </l>
        <l>For he'll by Irony each Play commend: </l>
        <l>Next these, we welcome such as briskly Dine, </l>
        <l>At Lambs, at Lockits, or with Shateline: </l>
        <l>Swell'd with Pottage, or the Burgundian Grape, </l>
        <l>They hither come, to take a kindly Nap. </l>
        <l>In these our Author don't conceive much harm, </l>
        <l>For they pay well and keep our Benches warm. </l>
        <l>And tho' scarce half awake some Plays they Dam, </l>
        <l>They'll doe't by whole-sale, not by Ounce and Dram. </l>
        <l>But when fierce Criticks get 'em in their view, </l>
        <l>Th'are Crustier than Spaniards in Peru: </l>
        <l>They wrack each line, and every word unknit, </l>
        <l>As if they'd find a way to Cramp all Wit. </l>
        <l>They are the Terrour of all adventurers here, </l>
        <l>The very objects of their hate and fear; </l>
        <l>And like rude Common-wealths they still are knit, </l>
        <l>'Gainst English Plays, the Monarchies of Wit. </l>
        <l>They invade Poetick licence, and still rail, </l>
        <l>At Plays to which in Duty they shou'd veil. </l>
        <l>Yet still they infest this Coast to fish for Iests, </l>
        <l>To suppliment their Wits at City feasts: </l>
        <l>Thus much for Criticks, to the more generous Wit </l>
        <l>Our Author frankly does each Scene submit: </l>
        <l>And begs your kind alliance to engage, </l>
        <l>Those Lawless Interlopers of the Stage. </l>

In sooth, though I say it, Mr. Anthony was a very hopeful Scholar, I mean of a Gentleman, before he kept such Lewd Debauch'd Society; he had a pritty smattering of the Greek, and for Latin he would declaim in it Extempore, and very rarely break Prissian's Head, but now forsooth, fresh and fasting, he longs to break his Fathers. </p>
