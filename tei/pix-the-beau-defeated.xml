        <head>TO HER GRACE THE Dutchess of BOLTON. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHen the Curious hand of Nature draws Perfection, when Beauty like yours appears, all are inspired with Wonder and Delight, every Heart is filled with Pleasure, because every Heart is full of you; Pardon my Ambition, Pardon the daring of a Pen, too weak to Coppy inimitable Graces; but if none may aim at your lovely Picture, unless they have Power to do you Justice, your Praises must be left unsung, and you for ever adored in Silence. </p>
        <p>I own the following Play claims not the least Merrit to such a Glorious Protection, but that is all I have to boast, all the reward my Towring Fancy covets, is centred in my Illustrious Patronesses; this will to after Ages make my Trifle Sacred, when they behold prefix'd such Names, whose Virtues Historians, Poets, and never dying Fame shall join with me to Eternize. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000671-003-a"/>
        <p>The Play is partly a Translation from the French; what I added, if it had not the power to please, had no Immodesty to offend, which I hope will be an attonement with your Grace, for other Defects in my Younger Brother; I wou'd have perswaded the World to prize Desert, before the Gifts of Fortune, but the major part are too sordid to like the Example, few are so truly Noble to fix without Intrest, which makes so very few truly happy in their Choice. </p>
        <p>I wou'd have deferr'd Addressing to Your Grace, till I had aimed at an Offering more Worthy, but my Charmed Eyes being lately bless'd with the sight of You, have let into my mind such a Beautiful Idea, that I liv'd in pain till I express'd my Admiration. </p>
        <p>To be Great and Good, and Exquisitly Fair, are the happiest Epethets Fate bestows on Mortals; that they are justly Your Graces due&#9642; will, I am sure, be confirmed by an Universal Voice; and that you may Live long to adorn the Titles, whose Lustre receive addition from that Beauteous Fame, is the Eternal wish off </p>

        <l>YOur Servant Ladies fair&#8212; And how I pray, </l>
        <l>Like you my Dress and Garniture to Day. </l>
        <l>'Faith I've survay'd my self from Top to Toe, </l>
        <l>And find I make a most Accomplish'd Beau. </l>
        <l>If all these Charms, to win a Fortune fail, </l>
        <l>I'le leave Champagne, and drown my shape in Ale; </l>
        <l>What care I if I'm bigger than a Whale? </l>
        <l>But why should I despair of being Blest. </l>
        <l>Can Female Heart withstand a Man thus Drest? </l>
        <l>As I was lately Walking in the Mall, </l>
        <l>Heav'ns! how the Ladies flock'd about me all. </l>
        <l>I'le vow they came so Termagantly Fierce on, </l>
        <l>I fear'd some strange designs upon my Person. </l>
        <l>Says one, and faith the Nymph was well enough, </l>
        <l>Mind, with what Air and Grace he takes his Snuff, </l>
        <l>The second cry'd, and pray observe his Muff. </l>
