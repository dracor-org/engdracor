        <head>PROLOGUE To the Provok'd Wife, spoke by Mistress Bracegirdle. </head>
        <l>SInce 'tis the Intent and Business of the Stage, </l>
        <l>To Copy out the Follies of the Age; </l>
        <l>To hold to every Man a Faithful Glass, </l>
        <l>And shew him of what Species he's an Ass. </l>
        <l>I hope the next that teaches in the School, </l>
        <l>Will shew our Author he's a scribling Fool. </l>
        <l>And that the Satyr may be sure to Bite, </l>
        <l>Kind Heav'n! Inspire some venom'd Priest to Write, </l>
        <l>And grant some Vgly Lady may Indite. </l>
        <l>For I wou'd have him lash'd, by Heav'ns! I would, </l>
        <l>Till his presumption swam away in Blood. </l>
        <l>Three Plays at once proclaims a Face of Brass, </l>
        <l>No matter what they are! That's not the Case, </l>
        <l>To Write three Plays, ev'n that's to be an Ass. </l>
        <l>But what I least forgive, he knows it too, </l>
        <l>For to his Cost he lately has known you. </l>
        <l>Experience shews, to many a Writers smart </l>
        <l>You hold a Court where mercy ne're had part; </l>
        <l>So much of the old Serpent's Sting you have, </l>
        <l>You Love to Damn, as Heav'n Delights to Save. </l>
        <l>In Foreign Parts, let a bold Voluntiere, </l>
        <l>For publick Good upon the Stage appear, </l>
        <l>He meets ten thousand Smiles to Dissipate his Fear. </l>
        <l>All tickle on, th' adventuring young Beginner, </l>
        <l>And only scourge th' incorragible Sinner; </l>
        <l>They touch indeed his Faults, but with a hand </l>
        <l>So gentle, that his Merit still may stand: </l>
        <l>Kindly they Buoy the Follies of his Pen, </l>
        <l>That he may shun 'em when he Writes again. </l>
        <l>But 'tis not so, in this good natur'd Town, </l>
        <l>All's one, an Ox, a Poet, or a Crown, </l>
        <l>Old England's play was always knocking Down. </l>

          <p>No Boy was ever so weary of his Tutor; no Girl of her Bib; no Nun of doing Penance nor Old Maid of being Chast, as I am of being Married. </p>

          <p>The Devil's in the Fellow I think— I was told before I married him, that thus 'twou●d be; But I thought I had Charms enough to govern him; and that where there was an Estate, a Woman must needs be happy; so my Vanity has deceiv'd me, and my Ambition has made me uneasie. But some comfort still; if one wou'd be revenged of him, these are good times; a Woman may have a Gallant, and a separate maintenance too— The surly Puppy— yet <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000779-006-b"/>he's a Fool for't: For hitherto he has been no Monster: But who knows how far he may provoke me. I never lov'd him, yet I have been ever true to him; and that, in spight of all the attacks of Art and Nature upon a poor weak Womans heart, in favour of a Tempting Lover. </p>
          <p>Methinks so Noble a Defence as I have made, shou'd be rewarded with a better usage— Or who can tell— Perhaps a good part of what I suffer from my Husband may be a Judgment upon me for my cruelty to my Lover.— Lord with what pleasure cou'd I indulge that thought, were there but a possibility of finding Arguments to make it good. And how do I know but there may— Let me see— What opposes?— My Matrimonial Vow?— Why, what did I Vow: I think I promis'd to be true to my Husband. </p>
          <p>Well; and he promis'd to be kind to me. </p>
          <p>But he han't kept his Word— </p>
          <p>Why then I'm absolv'd from mine— ay, that seems clear to me. The Arguments good between the King and the People, why not between the Husband and the Wife? O, but that Condition was not exprest.— No matter, 'twas understood. </p>
          <p>Well, by all I see, If I argue the matter a little longer with my self, I shan't find so many Bug-bears in the way, as I thought I shou'd. Lord what fine notions of Virtue do we Women take up upon the Credit of old foolish Philosophers. Virtue's it's own reward, Virtue's this, Virtue's that;— Virtue's an Ass, and a Gallant's worth forty on't. </p>

          <p>That day will never come, be assur'd, Ned: Not but that I can pass a Night with a Woman, and for the time, perhaps, make my self as good sport as you can do. Nay, I can court a Woman too, call her Nymph, Angel, Goddess, what you please; but here's the Difference 'twixt you and I: I perswade a Woman she's an Angel; she perswades you she's one. </p>
          <p>Prithee let me tell you how I avoid falling in love; that which serves me for Prevention, may chance to serve you for a Cure. </p>

          <p>That using 'em moderately undoes us all; but I'll use 'em justly, and that you ought to be satisfied with. </p>
          <p>I always consider a Woman, not as the Taylor, the Shoo-maker, the Tire-woman, the Sempstress, (and which is more than all that) the Poet makes her; but I consider her as pure Nature has contriv'd her, and that more strictly than I should have done our old Grandmother Eve, had I seen her naked in the Garden; for I consider her turn'd inside out. Her Heart well examin'd, I find there Pride, Vanity, Covetousness, Indiscretion, but above all things, Malice; Plots eternally aforging, to destroy one anothers Reputations, and as honestly to charge the Levity of Mens Tongues with the Scandal; hourly Debates how to make poor Gentlemen in love with 'em, with no other intent, but to use 'em like Dogs when they have done; a constant Desire of doing more mischief, and an everlasting War, waged against Truth and Good-nature. </p>

          <p>As for her Motion, her Meen, her Airs, and all those Tricks, I know they affect you mightily. If you should see your Mistriss at a Coronation, dragging her Peacock's Train, with all her state and insolence about her, 'twould strike you with all the awful thoughts that Heaven it self could pretend to from you; whereas I turn the <pb n="18" xml:id="ep000779-014-a"/>whole matter into a Jest, and suppose her strutting in the self-same stately manner, with nothing on but her Stays, and her under scanty 〈◊〉 Petticoat. </p>

It's Father was a Dream, and it's Mother was the Moon. I dreamt, that by an unanimous Vote, I was chosen Queen of that Pale World. And that the first time I appear'd upon my Throne,— all my Subjects fell in Love with me. Just then I wak'd: and seeing Pen, Ink and Paper lie idle upon the Table, I slid into my Morning Gown, and writ this <hi>in promptu</hi>. </p>
