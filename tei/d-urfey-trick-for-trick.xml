        <l>SInce there's a Dearth of Witt, and that to Play, </l>
        <l>Is hardly worth one poor Brown George a Day; </l>
        <l>I from the Poet, and our Friends within, </l>
        <l>Am sent t'intreat, and your last Favours win, </l>
        <l>E're we go hence and shall no more be seen. </l>
        <l>For my part,— </l>
        <l>I'le to the French Campaigne, where one may get </l>
        <l>A certain Wholsome though a Homely Treat; </l>
        <l>Good Oyl and Cooling Sallads, though no meat: </l>
        <l>Good Campany, good honest Lowste Currs. </l>
        <l>There's Honour to be got too— Honour, Sirs; </l>
        <l>Honour that makes the General's Voice sound loud, </l>
        <l>And serves instead of Brandy to the Crowd. </l>
        <l>My Spirits are reviv'd; Methinks I hear </l>
        <l>A Crew of Fire-fac'd Rogues embattled there, </l>
        <l>Whose Motly Noses carry Hope and Fear: </l>
        <l>Cry out, Fall on, we shall be Kings, Great Men, </l>
        <l>Nay Emperours, the Devil knowes how, and when. </l>
        <l>Then Shouting all, advance they to the Siege, </l>
        <l>And to the Plunder fall with Priviledge. </l>
        <l>Pray tell me then, is it not better farr, </l>
        <l>To live abroad when other Nations Iarr, </l>
        <l>Then 'mongst our selves to make a Civil Warr? </l>
        <l>Are not these Bandaliers, this Sword, this Coat, </l>
        <l>Better than Tipstaves, or a Baily's Note? </l>
        <l>To day we Play Great Kings, strutt, bounce and fly, </l>
        <l>But e're next Morn the Shop's shut up— God buy. </l>
        <l>This by your great Unkindness is our Lott, </l>
        <l>We share and share, 'tis true— but nothing's got. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000555-003-a"/>
        <l>Like lab'ring Bees we toyle for Witt, though poor, </l>
        <l>Which you like Drones suck up, and hum for more, </l>
        <l>But bring in nothing to the Winter-Store. </l>
        <l>Witt is forgot; for with you Men of Miss, </l>
        <l>Sence is unnatural as Marriage is— </l>
        <l>Knowledge of this has made me what you see, </l>
        <l>And if your tempers change not instantly, </l>
        <l>Comedian Haines a man of Sword shall be. </l>
        <l>'Tis true, my Loyalty is not preserv'd, </l>
        <l>But that in many has for Profit swerv'd; </l>
        <l>Besides, 'tis better to be hang'd than starv'd. </l>

In fine, One that is indeed the Jewel among Women.

              <speaker>Sir Wild. </speaker>
              <p>Well sed Cock of Four— 'gad I like it well— Come Gentlemen— Pray let me Invite ye to my house— I'll provide a Collation, and we'l be heartily merry. </p>

              <speaker>Tho. </speaker>
              <p>Come, you shall go 'faith— for I am resolv'd to give my farewel to Intrigues, with a free and merry heart; and 'tis fit that you that are my Friends, shou'd be now my Witnesses, as you shall be when I go through the t'other Gate, Marriage. And tho' this kind of life is least troublesome; t'other is certainly most safe: especially, if a Man can change his Temper, else 'tis a Plague to him. For Marriage to a Debauchee, is a second Purgatory; It gives him onely a Prospect of Joy, or Torment, without knowing which he shall arrive to. But I hope I know my self better, than to venture without great Consideration to such Uncertainties. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE, By Mr. Mohun. </head>
        <l>THat I have been a Mad Old Fool to Night, </l>
        <l>I need not tell you; but to set all right, </l>
        <l>The Poet now makes me a Parasite. </l>
        <l>Sends me to flatter ye, and beg Excuse, </l>
        <l>For the Insipid Errors of his Muse: </l>
        <l>He bids me say, the less to show his Guilt, </l>
        <l>On the Foundation Fletcher laid, he built; </l>
        <l>New drest his Modish Spark fit to be shown, </l>
        <l>And made him more Debauch'd, t' oblige the Town. </l>
        <l>Drink, Rant and Sing, he now takes pains to be </l>
        <l>A perfect and accomplish'd Debauchee. </l>
        <l>But Criticks, you that never yet were known </l>
        <l>To think there could be Sence above your own; </l>
        <l>You that do surfet on the Spoyles of Witt, </l>
        <l>And still have less to shew, the more you get. </l>
        <l>Like barren Ground that swallowes up the Rain, </l>
        <l>Yet is by th' Industrious Hand Manur'd in vain, </l>
        <l>Will in your Censures your Ill Natures show, </l>
        <l>And with your Weeds choak up the Grain we sowe. </l>
        <l>I know you'l cry, Confound this tedious Stuff, </l>
        <l>He has not made the Spark half mad enough; </l>
        <l>He should have been all Air, and th' Mode pursue, </l>
        <l>That is, keep Miss, kick Wise, and Run Men through: </l>
        <l>Ashore you give good proofs of this each day; </l>
        <l>Pray Heav'n you hold and prove as mad at Sea. </l>
        <l>But that I think there's none can doubt or fear; </l>
        <l>No,— Witt's a greater Plague to you than Warr. </l>
        <l>Witt that is now us'd like a Common slave, </l>
        <l>Both by those have none, as well as those that have. </l>
        <l>Therefore against such to procure defence, </l>
        <l>Not doubting th' Aid of all the Men of Sence, </l>
        <l>The Poet now the Ladies help do's Crave, </l>
        <l>That with a frown or smile can damn or save. </l>
        <l>And as the Mighty God of Witt shines clear, </l>
        <l>And shines upon his Fav'rites once a Year; </l>
        <l>From them that Sacred Influence let him find, </l>
        <l>That he may say he Once found Beauty kind. </l>
