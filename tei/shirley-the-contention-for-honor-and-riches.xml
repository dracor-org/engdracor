        <head>TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPfull and his honoured friend, EDWARD GOLDING of Colston in Nottingham-shire Esquire. </head>
        <p>WHere there is a will to be gratefull, the acknowledgement supplies the defect of action, reddit enim beneficium qui libenter debet. Although this hold no force in the common and municipall lawes, where men doe no benefit, before they account to receive; it is allowed a Canon in moralitie, where many good deeds are to be lost, that wee may place one well. No man can dye in debt, that hath an honest remembrance of his obligation, since death is to bee reckoned from the first day of our ingratitude. In this confidence I appeare, and being neither guilty of desert, or power to reward, I must present the memory of your owne act and vertue to pay your selfe. </p>
        <p>That which waiteth upon my thankes, is this handfull of paper imaginations, though below your <pb xml:id="ep000266-003-a"/>study, not beneath your vertue to accept, and smile upon; they were meant for innocent mirth, and can bee no prejudice, if they onely serve to set off your Nobler Contemplations. Read when you will dispence with halfe an houre, and continue your favour to him, whose ambition is to write himselfe </p>
