          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THIS Play was given to my Care by a Friend: I promis'd him not to neglect it in the Difficulties it was to pass through. It has had hitherto but an unpleasant Journey; and I knew no better way to make it Amends, than by taking up its Rest with you; where I am assur'd its Reception will be the best a truly Noble and Generous Soul can give. </p>
        <p>I beg not your Protection, Sir, from those wide-mouth'd Curs, the Critcks: But since they have had their Ends in running it down, 'tis under the Shelter of your Name I desire a poor maim'd Thing, that did its best to shew them Sport, may lye secure from farther Danger. </p>
        <p>It has been long a receiv'd Maxim, That to support the Oppressed, is no less commendable, <pb xml:id="ep000583-003-a"/>than to lead the Victor Captive. This Consideration, Sir, with the General good Character the too often detracting World allows you, has encourag'd me (I will not say to trouble you, since doing Good is your Diversion) but still to rely upon your unwearied Generosity. </p>
        <p>Both my self, and my Friend, the Author of this Unsuccessful Piece, as we cannot pretend to justifie its Defects, so, if it were in our Power, we shou'd not choose to do it in a way so Publick, least by an impolitick Defence of its Merit, we should lessen the Greatness of your condescending good Nature, in Protecting so mean a Trifle. </p>
        <p>I have but one Reason to wish it had been better; which is, That its Merit might then, perhaps, have given me a larger Opportunity of Publishing that Respect and Observant Zeal, wherewith I am </p>

        <p>Writ and Spoke by Mr. Horden. </p>
        <l>AS idle Beggars, when they'd Pity move, </l>
        <l>With borrow'd Bastard at their Backs do rove, </l>
        <l>T' incite good Christians Charity and Love, </l>
        <l>So I, that I might have a fair Pretence </l>
        <l>To feed (what some Fools call Extravagance) </l>
        <l>Have begg'd this spurious Play from Hands unknown. </l>
        <l>I have engag'd, the honest Rakes o'th' Town, </l>
        <l>That they will all espouse it as their own. </l>
        <l>But e&#9642; re 'tis tried, let me its Cudgels choose: </l>
        <l>I first except all Writers for the other House, </l>
        <l>All good Authors, and&#8212; no, I'll trust the Beaux: </l>
        <l>For it's so free from Wit they've no Pretension </l>
        <l>To damn one Line for want of Apprehension. </l>
        <l>Besides, each Beau's a Friend; for if it miss, </l>
        <l>He'll not disturb his solemn Face to hiss. </l>
        <l>And good or bad, the Ladies sure will spare </l>
        <l>The generous Poet, for the labouring Player. </l>
        <l>And now your Smiles a double Kindness hold, </l>
        <l>The Poet shares the Praises, I the Gold. </l>
        <l>Guineas, they say, in low condition be, </l>
        <l>Pray Heav'n they're low enough to fall to me. </l>
        <l>Yet you who've kept 'em by you, don't repent ye, </l>
        <l>My Guinea Box takes all at Nine and twenty. </l>
