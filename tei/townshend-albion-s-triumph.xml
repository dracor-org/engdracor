      <argument>
        <p>THe King and Queenes Maiesty having signified their pleasure to haue a new Maske this New yeare, Master Inigo Iones and I were employed in the Invention And we agreed the subiect of it should be a Triumphe in ALBIPOLIS the chiefe City of ALBION. The Triumpher, ALBANACTVS, And ALBA this Ilands Goddesse. Names not improper, eyther for the Place, or for the Persons: ALBION being (as it once was) taken for England; ALBANACTVS, for the King, Quasi in Albania natus: Borne in Scotland. And ALBA, for the Queene whose native Beauties have a great affinity with all Purity and Whitenesse. The Kings <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000297-003-a"/>devoting himselfe to this Goddesse, is but the seeking of that happy Vnion which was preordeyned by the greatest of the Gods. IOVE therefore sends downe MERCVRY to ALBA, to acquaint her that he had decreed a Tryumph, which( a farre of) she might behold: Concealing his further Councells, vntill ALBANACTVS were subdued to Love and Chastity, by CVPID and DIANA, who descend, and having conquerd the Conquerer, They shew him the Queene. The King, yeilds, And presents himselfe a Suppliant, to the Goddesse ALBA. She embraces him, And makes him Copartner of her Deity. </p>

          <head>The Description of the SCENE. </head>
          <p>The first thing that presented it selfe to the eye, was the Ornament that went about the Scene: in the middest of which, was placed a great Armes of the Kings, with Angels holding an Emperiall Crowne, from which hung a Drapery, of crimson Velvet, fringed with gold, tackt in severall knotts, that on each-side, with many folds, was wound about a Pillaster; in the <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000297-003-b"/>freeze, were festones of severall fruites in their naturall colours, on which, in gratious postures lay Children sleeping; at each end was a double sheild, with a Gorgons head, and at the foot of the pillasters, on each side, stood two Women, the one young, in a watchet Robe looking vpwards, and on her head, a paire of Compasses of gold, the poynts standing towards Heaven: the other more ancient, and of a venerable aspect, apparreled in tawney, looking downewards; in the one hand a long ruler, and in the other, a great paire of iron Compasses, one poynt whereof, stood on the ground, and the other touched part of the ruler. Above their heads, were fixt, compertiments of a new composition, and in that over the first, was written Theorica, and over the second Practica, shewing that by these two, all works of Architecture, and Ingining have their perfection. The Curtaine being suddenly drawne vp, the first Sceane appeared, which represented a Romane Atrium, with high Collombs of white Marble, and ornaments of Architecture of a composed maner of great proiecture, enricht with carving, and betweene every retorne of these Collombs, stood Statues of gold on round pedestalls, and beyond these, were other peeces of Architecture of a Pallace royall. </p>
          <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000297-004-a"/>
          <p>Over all was a serene skie, out of which a cloude began to breake foorth, and as it discended, a person was discovered, sitting in it, which by his Petasus and Caduceus, was knowne to be Mercury, the messenger of Iove. </p>

            <p>For example Ambition, is a Lyon; Cruelty, a Beare; Avarice, a Wolfe. Yet He subdues them all. To be short, no Vyce is so small, to scape him: Nor so great, but he overcomes it: And in that fashion he Triumphes over all the Kings, and Queenes that went before him. All his Passions, are his true Subiects: And Knowledge, Iudgment, Merit, Bounty and the like, are fit Comma ders, for such a Generall, These Triumph with him, And these are the Princes you saw about him.
