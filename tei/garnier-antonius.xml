        <head>¶ The Argument. </head>
        <p>AFTER the ouerthrowe of Brutus and Cassius, the libertie of Rome being now vtterly oppressed, and the Empire setled in the hands of Octauius Caesar and Marcus Antonius, (who for knitting a straiter bonde of amitie betweene them, had taken to wife Octauia the sister of Caesar) Antonius vndertooke a iourney agàinst the Parthians, with intent to regaine on them the honor won by them from the Romanes, at the discomfiture and slaughter of Crassus. But comming in his iourney into Siria the places renewed in his remembrance <pb xml:id="ep000024-003-a"/>the long intermitted loue of Cleopatra Queene of Aegipte: who before time had both in Cilicia and at Alexandria, entertained him with all the exquisite delightes and sumptuous pleasures, which a great Prince and voluptuous louer could to the vttermost desire. Wherevpon omitting his enterprice, he made his returne to Alexandria, againe falling to his former loues, without any regarde of his vertuous wife Octauia, by whom neuertheles he had excellent children. This occation Octauius toke of taking armes against him: &amp; preparing a mighty fleet, encountred him at Actium, who also had assembled to that place a great number of Gallies of his own, beside, 60. which Cleopatra brought with her from Aegipt, But at the very beginning of the battel Cleopatra with all her Gallies betooke her to flight, which Antony seeing could not but follow: by his departure <pb xml:id="ep000024-003-b"/>to Octauius the greatest victory which in any Seabattell hath beene hard off. Which he not negligent to pursue, followes them the next spring and besiedgeth them with in Alexandria, where Antony finding al that he trusted to faile him, beginneth to growe iealouse and to suspect Cleopatra. She therevpon enclosed her selfe with two of her women in a monument she had before caused to be built, thence sends him worde she was dead: which he beleeuing for truth, gaue himselfe with his Sworde a deadly wound: but died not vntil a messenger came from Cleopatra to haue him brought to her to the tombe. Which she not daring to open least she should bee made a prisoner to the Romaines, &amp; carried in Caesars triumph, cast downe a cord from an high window, by the which (her women helping her) she trussed vp Antonius halfe dead, &amp; so got him into the monument. The stage supposed alexandria: the chorus first Egiptians, &amp; after Romane souldiors: The history to be read at large in Plutarch in the life of Antonius. </p>
