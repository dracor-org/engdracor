          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>COmpositions of this nature, have heretofore been graced by the acceptance, and protection of the greatest Nobility (I may say Princes) but in this age, when the Scene of Drammatick Poetry is changed into a wilderness, it is hard to find a patron to a legitimate muse. Many that were wont to encourage Poems, are faln beneath the proverbiall want of the composers, and by their ruins are only at leasure to take measure with their eye, of what they have been. Some extinguished with their fortune, have this happiness, to be out of capacity of further shipwrack, while their sad remaynes peep out of the sea, and may serve naked marks, and caution to other Navigators, Malignant stars the while! In this unequall condition of the time, give me leave to congratulate my own felicity, that hath directed this Comedy unto you, who wear your nobleness with more security, than titles, and a name that continues bright and impassible among the constellations in our Sphear of English honour. I <pb xml:id="ep000820-004-a"/>dare not detain you, Sir, with too long a Preface; if you please to entertain these Papers, as the modest tender of my service, I shall receive it as a most kind influence upon me; and you will engage to all your commands, the humble heart of </p>

        <head>Prologue at the Black-Fryers. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>DOes this look like a Term? I cannot tell, </l>
          <l>Our Poet thinks the whole Town is not well, </l>
          <l>Has took some Physick lately, and for fear </l>
          <l>Of catching cold dares not salute this Ayr. </l>
          <l>But ther's another reason, I hear say </l>
          <l>London is gone to York, 'tis a great way; </l>
          <l>Pox o'the Proverb, and of him say I, </l>
          <l>That look'd ore Lincoln, cause that was, must we </l>
          <l>Be now translated North? I could rail to </l>
          <l>On Gammar Shiptons Ghost, but 't wo' not doe, </l>
          <l>The Town will still be flecking, and a Play </l>
          <l>Though ne'r so new, will starve the second day: </l>
          <l>Upon these very hard conditions, </l>
          <l>Our Poet will not purchase many Towns; </l>
          <l>And if you leave us too, we cannot thrive, </l>
          <l>I'l promise neither Play nor Poet live </l>
          <l>Till ye come back, think what you do, you see </l>
          <l>What audience we have, what Company </l>
          <l>"To Shakespear comes, whose mirth did once beguile </l>
          <l>" Dull hours, and buskind, made even sorrow smile, </l>
          <l>"So lovely were the wounds, that men would say </l>
          <l>" They could endure the bleeding a whole day: </l>
          <l>He has but few friends lately, think o'that, </l>
          <l>Hee'l come no more, and others have his fate. </l>
          <l>"Fletcher the Muses darling, and choice love </l>
          <l>" Of Phoebus, the delight of every Grove; </l>
          <l>"Vpon whose head the Laurel grew, whose wit </l>
          <l>" Was the Times wonder, and example yet, </l>
          <l>'Tis within memory, Trees did not throng, </l>
          <l>As once the Story said to Orpheus song. </l>
          <l>"Johnson, t' whose name, wise Art did bow, and Wit </l>
          <l>" Is only justified by honouring it: </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000820-005-a"/>
          <l>"To hear whose touch, how would the learned Quire </l>
          <l>" With silence stoop? and when he took his Lyre, </l>
          <l>"Apollo dropt his Lute, asham'd to see </l>
          <l>" A Rival to the God of Harmonie. </l>
          <l>You do forsake him too, we must deplore </l>
          <l>This fate, for we do know it by our door. </l>
          <l>How must this Author fear then, with his guilt </l>
          <l>Of weakness to thrive here, where late was spilt </l>
          <l>The Muses own blood, if being but a few, </l>
          <l>You not conspire, and meet more frequent too? </l>
          <l>There are not now nine Muses, and you may </l>
          <l>Be kind to ours, if not, he bad me say, </l>
          <l>Though while you careless kill the rest, and laugh, </l>
          <l>Yet he may live to write your Epitaph. </l>
