        <head>To the Right Honourable Sir Francis Child, Kt. Lord Mayor of the City of London. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IN Your Lordship's Accession to the CHAIR, advanced by so many Eminent Merits to that High Post, there needs but a very little Spirit of Prophecy to foretel with what true Glory Your Lordship will execute that Honourable Trust. To say, Your Lordship will answer the Expectation of the World, speaks too little: There's something more than Expectation, an Universal Assurance and Confidence of Your Lordship's Performance. </p>
        <p>And whilst the Worshipful Company of GOLDSMITHS, have, after a three Years Cessation, reviv'd the Customary Splendor of the City on this Solemn Occasion, I dare not say, 'tis wholly their own Natural Grandeur and Magnificence, so much as their Gratitude that furnishes the Entertainment. Your Lordship makes so considerable a Lustre, and gives that Ornament to their Society; that this Publick Triumph, on Your Inauguration-Day, is not so much a Present they make You, as a Debt they pay You. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000716-003-a"/>
        <p>Of all Your Lordship's numerous Virtues, the truly Noble Train that attend You thither, Your Unshaken Constancy to Your <hi>Native Altars </hi>seems to carry the Leading Glory. Your Lordship's truly Christian Undivided Knees, pay that greater and more entire Adoration to an Eternal Throne, than to make at one time a Cain's, and, at another, an Abel's Sacrifice. Your Lordship would start at so poor a Prevarication with Omnipotence, as to bring a Sheaf of Stubhle to Your Morning Oblation, and a Lamb to Your Evening one. </p>
        <p>Nor are Your Lordship's Moral Perfections less Conspicuous: You ascend to this Metropolitan Dignity, wholly untainted with the too common Avarice of Greatness. No, my Lord, You come not thither to Gather, but Shower the Gold; whilst warm'd and animated by Your own innate. Principles both of Charity and Hospitality, those two Illustrious Ornaments of Magistracy, Your Lordship has resolved to recal from their late Banishment: And indeed those truly radiant Virtues could never appear on the <hi>Praetorian Chair </hi>with nobler Lustre than now; considering they will so immediately break forth in that full Glory there, after so total an Eclipse before. 'Tis thus Your Lordship designs in Your Administration of Your Mayoralty to waken and revive the late drooping and languishing Honour of the City: And indeed to give a new Resurrection to the Grandeur of the Chair; which I may honestly say has some time lain buried. 'Tis thus, my Lord, the Shades behind You will illustrate Your own Glories before You; Or, to speak in the Goldsmiths Dialect, Those Foils will set off Your Diamond. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000716-003-b"/>
        <p>But what has yet more nobly signaliz'd Your Lordship; In the late Suppression of the Defaced and Adulterated Coin, at the time when all the Private and <hi>Publick Banks </hi>of England, and indeed the whole Currency of Exchequers and Treasury's stood almost intirely stopt; at that time when 'twas no forfeited Credit even for the proudest Court or <hi>City Heads </hi>to play the Insolvents; 'twas then Your Lordship's Particular, I might say, Only Pride, that when all the other <hi>Golden Veins of the Nation </hi>were stagnated, Yours alone kept their whole open Circulation: You answered all Bills with the same prompt and entire Satisfaction, perhaps to the Wonder, at least to the Envy of the World. And tho' the then general Examples all round Ye, might have excused You from that Stretch of Payment; yet Your Lordship so valued Your Reputation, as to do Justice even to a Supererrogation. </p>
        <p>And here methinks Your Lordship's very Coat of Arms, the long <hi>Hereditary Escutcheon of Your Family</hi>, by a kind of <hi>Prophetical Herauldry </hi>seems to blazon the very Virtues of Your Lordship that bears them; when Your Lordship's <hi>Argent Eagles </hi>truly soard, whilst your Neighbours flagg'd and droop'd. </p>
        <p>But in enumerating Your Lordship's singular Worth and Deserts, I am enter'd into too large a Field, and therefore shall modestly retire, with subscribing my Self, </p>

        <head>TO THE Worshipful Company OF GOLDSMITHS. </head>
        <p>AS we are all naturally Ambitious to serve the Noblest Masters, You may believe, Gentlemen, that my humble Muse takes no common Pride in being call'd up to entertain You. For besides the particular commanding Merits of so many Honourable Members of Your Society, I cannot but consider what extraordinary dazling Lustre even Your Profession it self carries with it. </p>
        <p>When I enter into the Goldsmiths Laboratory, methinks I see even Soveraignty it self shine there: The very Strongest Nerves of War, and the Richest Blessings of Peace, in effect the only Product of Your Forge, are all Your own. Nay, even <hi>Crown'd Heads </hi>hold their very Thrones but by a Precarious Tenure, without Your <hi>Mints of Gold </hi>to support 'em. </p>
        <p>The famous Columbus in his <hi>Peruvian Discovery</hi>, found out a <hi>New World </hi>for little more than only to supply Your Furnace: Nay, the very Sun himself is but the Goldsmiths Fellow-Labourer, whilst his most vigorous Beams warm the rich Beds, and impregnate all the whole Mineral Veins, to furnish Your Shops of <hi>Gold. Gold</hi>, I may honestly say, (Your Handy-work) does all Things, nay indeed is all Things, or at least makes all Things its own. 'Tis from the Golden Mine that the Pallaces of Monarchs, nay the very Temples and Altars of Heaven, receive not only their Noblest Ornaments, but even their very Foundation. </p>
        <p>And tho', 'tis true, that sometimes that too fatal Mineral, may be the Temptation of Vice, or the Purchase of Shame and Injustice; yet to over-ballance those more unhappy Influences, 'tis no less the highest Reward of Virtue. Industry, Study, Labour, and all the honest Toils of Life sweat only for that Prize: In short, we are all Smiths at Your Anvile, and only hammer for the Gold. Thus, tho the Golden Show'r may sometimes fall into a wanton Danae's Lap, yet 'tis that very glittering Metal too, that wreaths the Bracelets, and moulds the very Coronets for a Diana. </p>
        <p>But, Gentlemen, not to expatiate upon so voluminous a Subject, 'tis enough to Congratulate Your present Pride and Glory, in having the fairest Royal (or at least Deputy Royal) Collar of SS's, and the Richest <hi>Gold Chain </hi>of England, among You: To whom wishing all Continuance of Honour, and Your Selves of Happiness, I am, </p>

        <head>The Second PAGEANT, The GOLDSMITHS Laboratory. </head>
        <p>A Large and Spacious Work-shop of several Artificers, distinct in their proper Apartments for the several Operators in the Mystery of the Goldsmiths, containing Forges, Anvils, Hammers, and other Instruments of Art, &amp;c. In the middle of this Laboratory, on a rich Golden Chair of State, is seated St. Dunstan, the ancient Patron and Guardian of the Company, array'd in his Pontifical Ornaments, expressing his Prelatical Dignity, in a Surplice of white Lawn, over which he wears a large Cope, &amp;c. On his Reverend Hoary Head, a Golden Mitre beset with precious Stones and Pearls of great Value: In his Left Hand he holds a Golden Crosier; in his Right Hand a Pair of Goldsmiths Tongs, an Emblem of his Patronage; and under his Feet lies the Devil. </p>
        <p>On each side this Noble Seat is plac'd Apollo and Esculapius his Son, in their proper Habits, bearing the City's and Company's Banners, and playing on several Melodious Instruments, as well for his Lordship's Diversion, as to preserve a Harmony and Decorum among the Artificers. </p>
        <p>Beneath the Steps of Ascension to the Canonical Chair, in opposition to the Patron, is placed a Goldsmiths Forge, with Fire and Crucibles filled with Gold; a Boy blowing the Bellows. On either Hand, in the Front of this Shop, is set up a large Press of Gold and Silver Plate, with Compters, &amp;c. representing a formal Shop of Trade: On each side are Jewellers at Work, with Anvils, Hammers, Stones, Sparks; besides a Planisher, a Raiser, a Drawer and Chacer, &amp;c. Several Artificers beating out Plate, and fashioning several Vessels of Gold and Silver: Likewise an Essay-Master with his Class, Frame and Ballance, for trying of Gold and Silver by the Standard. In another Apartment is Disgrossing, Flatting and Drawing of Gold and Silver Wire. In another are included Finers and Refiners, Melting, Smelting, Fining, Refining and Separating Gold and Silver, both by Fire and Water; and the Master-Forger and three other Workmen making a Massy Piece of Plate, Singing and keeping Time on the Anvil. </p>

          <l>Our Laws and Rights sent kindly to restore, </l>
          <l>She visited the Albion World once more. </l>
          <l>Thus whilst our Caesar yields a Trust so large, </l>
          <l>As proud Augusta to Your Guardian Charge. </l>
          <l>As He from Heav'n His Sovereign Justice drew; </l>
          <l>He's Heav'ns Vicegerent, His Vicegerent, You. </l>
          <l>Astraea then must here her Pow'r resign, </l>
          <l>Her brightest Glories in Your Hand shall shine. </l>
          <l>You'll best, my Lord, my Righteous Ballance hold, </l>
          <l>No Poise so even as in the Scales of Gold. </l>

        <head>The Fourth and Last PAGEANT, The Temple of HONOUR. </head>
        <p>THIS Pageant being the Representation of the true Merit that has rais'd His Lordship to that Honourable Dignity; in the chief Seat in Front sits a noble Figure personating HONOUR, with the Banner of the City's; on his Head a Silver Head-Piece and a stately Plume of Crimson Feathers, his Vest embroider'd with Gold, Silver, and precious Stones; a Robe of Scarlet inrich'd with Embroidery of Tissue, with Buskins, and a Silken Scarf fringed with Gold. </p>
        <p>On the same Basis, in three other Seats, are planted <hi>Peace, Plenty</hi>, and Liberality, properly drest, as the suitable Attributes and Attendants on HONOUR. At the Feet of these are laid the four Principal Rivers of Trade, as <hi>Tiber, Nile, Danube</hi>, and Thames, with their several Hierogliphicks, in Rich Habits, with Garlands of Flowers, and Banners flying, &amp;c. </p>
        <p>Ths Structure is formed of the Compositive Order, most nobly set forth with Painting and Carving in Gold and Silver to an infinite Lustre, being made of that precious Stone called <foreign xml:lang="lat">Lapis Lazuli</foreign>. On the upper part over each Pilaster are four Pyramids of Trophies of Armour, Bows, Quivers, &amp;c. being the ancient Emblem of Honour, Love and Virtue, and crown'd with the Four Imperial Crowns of <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi>, and Ireland. </p>

        <lg>
          <l>
            <hi>TO Britain's </hi>Dread Caesar, we'll tune up our Joy: </l>
          <l>To Caesar, and Caesar's Great City-Viceroy: </l>
          <l>Tis Caesar has lent him the Scales and the Sword, </l>
          <l>And Augusta salutes him her Guardian Lord. </l>
          <l>Whilst the World all around her, </l>
          <l>'Twixt Envy and Wonder, </l>
          <l>Shall see her proud Chair like the Throne shine in Gold. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Of War he has ended the Toil and the Pain; </l>
          <l>And WILLIAM's Work now is to Smile and to Raign. </l>
          <l>In the soft Sweets of Peace, in one Olive Bow'r, </l>
          <l>The Crown and the Chair, the whole Scepter of Pow'r, </l>
          <l>All blooming like Aaron's old Wand we behold; </l>
          <l>Whilst calmly possessing </l>
          <l>The Halcyon Blessing, </l>
          <l>We'll merrily troll round the Goblets of Gold. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>The Ermin and Fir, the Robe and the Gown, </l>
          <l>On this side the Chaplet, on that side the Crown, </l>
          <l>Together shall taste that General Joy, </l>
          <l>Which the whole Pow'r of Hell shall never destroy: </l>
          <l>Our Albion thus blest, this Scene to behold, </l>
          <l>The Day shall shine brighter, </l>
          <l>The Sun gallop lighter, </l>
          <l>And Phoebus new-burnish his Chariot of Gold. </l>
