        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>OF all men those have reason least to care </l>
        <l>For being laugh'd at, who can laugh their share: </l>
        <l>And that's a thing our Author's Apt to use </l>
        <l>Upon occasion, when no man can chuse. </l>
        <l>Suppose now at this instant one of you </l>
        <l>Were tickled by a Fool, what would you do? </l>
        <l>'Tis ten to one you'd laugh, here's just the case, </l>
        <l>For there are Fools that tickle with their Face. </l>
        <l>Your gay Fool tickles with his Dress, and Motions, </l>
        <l>But your grave Fool of Fools, with silly Notions. </l>
        <l>Is it not then unjust that Fops should still </l>
        <l>Force one to laugh, and then take laughing ill? </l>
        <l>Yet since perhaps to some it gives offence, </l>
        <l>That men are tickled at the want of Sence; </l>
        <l>Our Author thinks he takes the readiest way </l>
        <l>To shew all he has laugh'd at here fair play. </l>
        <l>For if ill writing be a folly thought, </l>
        <l>Correcting ill is sure a greater fault. </l>
        <l>Then Gallants laugh, but chuse the right place first, </l>
        <l>For judging ill is of all faults the worst. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>PErhaps you Gentlemen, expect to day </l>
        <l>The Author of this fag end of a Play </l>
        <l>According to the Modern way of Wit </l>
        <l>Shou'd strive to be before-hand with the Pit, </l>
        <l>Begin to rail at you, and subtly to </l>
        <l>Prevent th' affront by giving the first blow. </l>
        <l>He wants not Presidents, which often sway </l>
        <l>In matters far more weighty than a Play: </l>
        <l>But he no grave admirer of a Rule, </l>
        <l>Won't by Example learn to play the fool. </l>
        <l>The end of Plays should be to entertain, </l>
        <l>And not to keep the Auditors in pain. </l>
        <l>Giving our price, and for what trash we please, </l>
        <l>He thinks the Play being done, you should have ease. </l>
        <l>No Wit, no Sence, no Freedom, and a Box, </l>
        <l>Is much like paying money for the Stocks. </l>
        <l>Besides the Author dreads the strut and meen </l>
        <l>Of new prais'd Poets, having often seen </l>
        <l>Some of his Fellows, who have writ before, </l>
        <l>When Nel has danc'd her Iig, steal to the Door, </l>
        <l>Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that </l>
        <l>Swell, and believe themselves the Lord knows what. </l>
        <l>Most Writers now adays are grown so vain, </l>
        <l>That once approv'd, they write, and write again, </l>
        <l>Till they have writ away the Fame they got; </l>
        <l>Our Friend this way of writing fancies not, </l>
        <l>And hopes you will not tempt him with your Praise, </l>
        <l>To rank himself with some that write new Plays: </l>
        <l>For he knows ways enough to be undone </l>
        <l>Without tbe help of Poetry for one. </l>
