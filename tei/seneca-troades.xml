        <head>TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>IF the Reflection upon other Misfortunes, may afford at any time Diversion, or Improvement, by minding us of the Signal Vicissitudes of Humane Affairs; these Tragical Scenes, which we now offer to publick view, (exhibiting a serious, yet withall, delightful Representation, of one of the most splendid Calamities that Antiquity hath transmitted to Posterity) may peradventure be look'd upon as no unpleasing Entertainment. </p>
        <p>The Poem, as to its Subject, wants nothing of Grandeur to ennoble it, nor, as to its Composition, of Ingenuity: Having gain'd by the joynt Suffrage of the most knowing Criticks of this latter Age (<hi>Lipsius, Delrius, Scaliger</hi>, and Heinsius) the <pb xml:id="ep000708-003-a"/>Title of <hi>The Divine Troades</hi>. And one of the most Eminent Modern Masters of Dramatick Poesy among us, Mr. Dryden, in his Essay upon that Subject, hath declar'd it to be the Master Piece of Seneca; especially that Scene therein, where Ulysses is seeking for Astyanax to kill him. There (says he) <hi>you have the Tenderness of a Mother so represented in </hi>Andromache, <hi>that it raises Compassion to a high Degree in the Reader, and bears the nearest Resemblance of any thing in the Antient Tragedies, to the excellent Scenes of Passion in </hi>Shakespeare, <hi>or in </hi>Fletcher. </p>
        <p>If in this our Version, those commendable Graces of the Original be not utterly lost, the candid Reader will find somthing therein, which happily, he may not dislike. </p>
        <p>For the better clearing of the obscurer places in the Poem, there are added some Mythological, Historical, and Topographical Notes; not such (I must confess) as may fully answer the expectation of the Critically Learned, yet such (if I mistake not) as may serve, in some Measure, to satisfie the ingenious Curiosity of the less knowing Reader. </p>

        <head>ARGUMENT. </head>
        <p>THE Greeks after ten Years War, having taken and ruin'd the City of Troy, were hindred from returning home by cross Winds. The Ghost of Achilles appearing denies any possibility of returning, until they sacrifice to his Ashes Polyxena, the Daughter of Priam and Hecuba, in treating about whose Nuptials he was treacherously slain. Agamemnon out of kindness to Polyxena, denies to have her sacrific'd. This begets a hot Dispute and Contest between Agamemnon and Pyrrhus, which Calchas at length decides, by declaring, That not only Polyxena, but Astyanax likewise, (Son of Hector and Andromache) were both to be slain e're they could hope for favourable Winds. In pursuance of which prophetical Decree, the one was by Ulysses thrown headlong from the <hi>Scaean Tower</hi>; and the other, habited like a Grecian Bride, sacrific'd by Pyrrhus at his Father's Monument. </p>

That towards the North and the Euxine Sea (call'd at present Amasia, and by the barbarous People Rum) comprehends <hi>Pontus, Cappadocia</hi>, and the residue of Galatia. The third and Southerly Part (now call'd Caramania, by <hi>Ortelius, Cottomanidi&#9679;&#8230;</hi>) lying along the Mediterranean Sea, contains the several Provinces of <hi>Cilicia, Pamphylia</hi>, and Lycaonia. The fourth and Easterly Part, which is stretch'd as far as Euphrates, (and, according to Baudrand, in <hi>Ferrarius's Lexicon</hi>, at this day call'd Aladuli) contains all that Tract of Land, by the Ancients call'd <hi>Armenia Minor. </hi>Over all which, and some part likewise of <hi>Asia Major, Priam </hi>was Lord Paramount: Whence may be collected the Greatness of his Dominions. </note>Asia's strong Support, of <ref target="A59189-e1580-b">c </ref>
                <note corresp="A59189-e1580-a" n="c" place="bottom">c <hi>Of God-like Hands th'egregious Labour</hi>.] The Town was first built by Dardanu&#9679;&#8230;, and call'd Dardania; afterwards, from <hi>Tros, Troj&#9679;&#8230;</hi>; then from Ilus, who much beautified and enlarg'd it, call'd Ilium: But the Walls were afterwards, in the time of Laomedon, raised by the hired Labour of Neptune and Apollo, as Homer first, and from him most of the Ancient Poets have reported, or rather fabled. The Origin of which Fiction, according to <hi>Eustathiu&#9679;&#8230;, in </hi>1. Odyss. sprung from hence, That Laomedon <hi>intending, for the greater security of his Regal City, to encompass the same with strong Walls, made use, towards the building of them, of the Treasure dedicated to </hi>Apollo and Neptune. With whom <hi>Services, in </hi>2. Aeneid. accords, where he says, That Laomedon, <hi>having vow'd a certain Sum of Money to be appropriated to the Sacrifices in honour of the forementioned Deities, was constrain'd, upon an invasion of the </hi>Mysians, <hi>his Enemies, to divert and employ the same in raising Walls for the Defence of his City. Whence those Gods are said to have immur'd </hi>Troy. Eustathius gives yet another Allegory of the Fable, which is this: <hi>The Poets </hi>(says he) <hi>attribute to the Walls of </hi>Troy, <hi>by way of excellence, what is requisite and necessary to all manner of Masonry, which hath need of </hi>Neptune, <hi>or Moisture, to cement the Materials, (Stones or Brick&#9679;&#8230;) and of </hi>Apollo, <hi>or the Heat of the Sun, to dry and harden the Work. </hi>

Strabo mentions two only, which open into the <hi>Palus Meotis</hi>, distant 60 Stadia one from the other. Ptolemy and Pliny allow no more. <hi>Albertus Campensis </hi>(as cited by <hi>Stuckius, in Schol. ad Periplum Arrian. in Pont. Eux.) </hi>affirms them to be three; Niger, five; But the two mentioned by <hi>Strabo, Ptolemy</hi>, and Pliny, seem to be, if not the only, the chief. Delrius conceives Seneca here makes Hecuba to apply to Tanais what is proper to Danubius, or Ister, by way of greater Decorum, as being a Woman, and ignorant of Geographical exactness. But the Errour doubtless is Seneca's own, who, elsewhere, in his <hi>Natural Questions</hi>, confounds Danubius with <hi>Tanais. Danubius </hi>(says he) <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sarmaticos impetus cohibens, &amp; Europam Asi&#225;mque disterminans. </foreign>For 'tis not Danubius, but Tanais, divides Europe from Asia. And this was a common Errour among the Romans, as is partly hinted at by Acron, upon Horace, and observed by the Learned Dr. <hi>Is. Vossius</hi>, in his Notes upon <hi>Scylax Cariandens</hi>. </note>

For Tigris falls into the Persian Gulf, not into the Erithraean, or Red Sea. Some, by <foreign xml:lang="lat">rubenti freto</foreign>, in the Original, would not have the <hi>Red Sea</hi>, properly so call'd, to be here meant, but the Sea made ruddy by the Morning Light, and the Sun's Rising Beams; which Interpretation yet, I conceive, will hardly pass without some grains of allowance. </note>

Who did it by this Stratagem. Coming like a Merchant with several Wares to sell, he expos'd them in the Court of Lycomedes; where among divers sorts of Womens Dresses, and other Accoutrements, proper for them, He set out sundry Arms, as well offence as defensive, of curious Workmanship. While the Virgins were looking upon such Merchandizes as were agreable to them, Achilles regarded only the Arms. Whereupon Ulysses gave private notice to a Trumpeter he had brought with him, to sound, at a fitting distance, a Charge, as if some Enemy were coming upon them. At which the young Ladies, affrighted, ran speedily away, to secure themselves, only Achilles undauntedly seiz'd upon a Buckler and a laveline, and put himself in a posture of desending his Life. By which act he discover'd himself to Ulysses, who, by fair persuasions, so wrought with him, that he went along with the Greeks to the Trojan War, See the History at large in <hi>Hyginus, De Fabulis, cap. </hi>96. in <hi>Statius, Achilleid. l. </hi>2. and <hi>Natalis Comes, l. </hi>9. c. 1. </note>himself Man, by assum'd Arms, confest. </l>

The Greek Army, marching to the siege of Troy, mistook their way, and fell into Mysia; where they were vigorously oppos'd by Telephus, King of that Country, who had like to have given them a total defeat, had not Bacchus, in requital of Agamemnon his many Sacrifices to him, caused a Vine suddenly to spring out of the Earth, with whose entangling branches, Telephus his Legs, or, as some say, those of his Horse, were ensnar'd, so that he was thrown to the ground, and at the same time dangerously wounded by Achilles, (to which Pindar seems to allude, in Isthm. Ode 8.) Of this hurt he could find no cure, till, consulting the Oracle, he was told, that he was to expect remedy from the Hand only that had wounded him. Whereupon he had recourse to Achilles, who gave him present cure, on condition he should be Guide to the Greeks, in their March against Troy, which in gratitude, he afterwards performed. The means of his Cure is variously reported. Some will have it by scraping the rust of his Spear-head, into Telephus his Wound. Others, that it was by the Juice of an Herb, call'd Syderiti&#9679;&#8230;, taught him by Chiron, very prevalent in the curing of Wounds; the Herb, from this application of Achilles, being afterwards called Achillea. Others, that it was by a Plaster of Verdigrease, of which they attribute the Invention to Achilles. Some, by a mixture of the Spearrust and Plaster. But Pliny inclines rather to the first, <hi>because the ancient Pictures </hi>(saies he) <hi>represent him scraping the rust of his Spear-head, with his Sword, into </hi>Telephus <hi>his Wound</hi>; the Poets and Painters agreeing herein.

For Homer (in Iliad. 2.) gives in a List of 1186. The Scholiast of <hi>Euripides (in Trag. Orest.) </hi>1155. <hi>Dares Phrygius</hi>, 1140. <hi>Cedrenus (Histor. Compend.</hi>) 1198. <hi>Thucydides (lib. </hi>1.) and <hi>Dion Prusiaeus (Orat. </hi>11.) 1200. <hi>Dictys Cretensis</hi>, 1255. Of all which Numbers, those given in by Homer and Thucydides seem to have the best warrant of Authority. And having said thus much of the Number of the Ships, it will not be amiss here, to give the Reader a Computation of the Army and Forces, by those Ships transported to the Seige of Troy. And if any Fastidious Heads shall look upon these minute Remarks, as unprofitable, or impertinent. I shall oppose against their censure the example of the incomparable Monsieur Bachet, who, in his curious Annotations upon Ovid's <hi>Heroical Epistles </hi>(whence he hath gain'd no less repute in Poetical Learning, than he hath done in Mathematical, by his admirable <hi>Commentary upon Diophantus</hi>) hath condescended to handle these very particulars, whose footsteps in this inquiry we follow, and accordingly find, that Eustathius (in Iliad. 2.) reckons them to amount to 120000. adding, that Aristarchus made them no less than 142320 Soldiers; for Authors differ no less about the Muster of the Forces, than they do in the Number of the Ships. There is a passage or two in Homer, whence the computation may be made; the the first, Iliad. 8. where the Trojan Camp is described, to contain 1000. Fires, and Fifty Soldiers allotted to warm themselves at each. By which reckoning, it may appear, that the Trojans, with their Allies, were only 50000. strong. Now in the second <hi>Iliad, Agamemnon </hi>boasts, that there were more than ten Greeks to every Trojan, By which accompt the Grecian Army would amount to above Five Hundred Thousand Men. And yet that seems incredible, in regard, that in the most flourishing State of Greece, which was about the time of Xerxes his Invasion, all Greece could not make head against Mardonius, with an Army of above a Hundred Thousand. The sorementioned Monsieur Ba&#9679;&#8230;het, in his Commentary upon the fifth Book of Diophantus his Arith. produces an Epigram (published <foreign xml:lang="lat">in Agone Homeri &amp; Hesiodi</foreign>, set forth in Greek) where Homer is introduc'd, to answer Hesiod's Question, touching the Number of the Grecian Army; thus in Latin, <lg>
                      <l>Septeni luxere foci, sed quemlibet ante </l>
                      <l>Quinquaginta caro verubus transfixa tremebat, </l>

                    </lg>Which is resolved, by Multiplying together 7 (the Number of the Fires, and 50 (the Number of the Spits) making 350. then, by that, Multiplying 900. the Number of Men, fed by the Flesh on one Spit, which will make the Number of 315000. Soldiers. But Thucydides, a most grave Historian (lib. 1.) computes the Number after this manner. He supposes, that, in every one of the greater Ships, there might be 120. Soldiers; in every one of the lesser 50&#9642; both amounting to 170. Of which sum of 170. taking a Medium, by halving, there will then remain 85. the Number of Men supposed to be in each Ship, one with another. Wherefore Multiplying the Number of Homer's whole Fleet, being 1186. Ships, by 85. the Product will be 100810. Soldiers: or, according to Thucydides his own List of the Ships, being 1200. Multiply'd by 85, as asoresaid, 102000 Men. </note>a Thousand Ships, or Ten Years Toil. </l>
