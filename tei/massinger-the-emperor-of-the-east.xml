        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE, AND MY especiall good Lord, IOHN Lord MOHVNE, Baron of Okehampton, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My good Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>LET my presumption in stiling you so (hauing neuer deseru'd it in my seruice) from the clemencie of your noble disposition finde pardon. The reuerence due to the Name of Mohune, longe since honored in three Earls of Sommerset, and eight Barons of Munster, may challenge from all pennes a deserued celebration. And the rather in respect those Titles were not purchas'd, but conferr'd, and continued in your Ancestours, for many vertuous, noble, and still liuing Actions; nor euer forfeited, or tainted, but when the iniquitie of those times labour'd the depression of approued goodnesse, and in wicked policie held it fit that Loyaltie, and Faith, in taking part with the true Prince, should be degraded, and mulcted. But this admitting no farther dilation in this place, may your Lordship please, and with all possible breuitie to vnderstand, the reasons why I am in humble thankfulnesse ambitious <pb xml:id="ep000166-003-a"/>to shelter this Poem vnder the wings of your Honorable protection. My worthy friend Mr Aston Cokaine your Nephew, to my extraordinarie content, deliuer'd to mee, that your Lordship at your vacant hours sometimes vouchsaf'd to peruse such trifles of mine, as haue passed the Presse, &amp; not alone warranted them in your gentle suffrage, but disdain'd not to bestow a remembrance of your loue, and intended fauour to mee. I professe to the world, I was exalted with the bountie, and with good assurance, it being so rare in this age to meete with one Noble Name, that in feare to bee censur'd of leuitie, and weakenesse, dares expresse it selfe, a friend, or Patron to contemn'd Poetrie. Hauing therefore no meanes els left mee to witnesse the obligation, in which I stand most willingly bound to your Lordship, I offer this Tragae-Comoedie to your gratious acceptance, no way despairing, but that with a cleere aspect, you will daine to receiue it (it being an induction to my future endeauours) and that in the list of those, that to your merit truely admire you, you may descend to number, </p>

          <l>There is no fault about thy Booke, but this, </l>
          <l>And it will shew how faire thy Emperour is. </l>
          <l>Thou more then Poet, our Mercurie (that art </l>
          <l>Apollo's Messenger, and do'st impart </l>

          <l>To purifie the slighted English tongue, </l>
          <l>That both the Nymphes of Tagus, and of Poe, </l>
          <l>May not henceforth despise our language so. </l>
          <l>Nor could they doe it, if they ere had seene </l>
          <l>The matchlesse features of the faerie Queene; </l>
          <l>Read Iohnson, Shakespeare, Beaumont, Fletcher, or </l>
          <l>Thy neat-limnd peeces, skilfull Massinger. </l>
          <l>Thou knowne, all the Castillians must confesse </l>

          <l>And more; that all Poetik soules yet knowne </l>
          <l>Are met in thee, vnited, and made one. </l>
          <l>This is a truth, not an applause. I am </l>
          <l>One that at farthest distance view thy flame, </l>
          <l>Yet may pronounce, that were Apollo dead, </l>
          <l>In thee his Poesie might all bee read. </l>
          <l>Forbeare thy modestie. Thy Emperours veine </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
