        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Humbly▪ Dedicate my first Endeavours for the Stage to your Lordship, whose powerful Patronage so generously supports it. The Ancients thus devoted the first Fruits to their Tutelary Divinities. 'Tis true that what I offer comes from a foreign Plant, and is not ripen'd to that Delicacy that shou'd recommend it to your exquisite Taste: Yet I hope your Lordship will be <hi>kindly prejudic'd </hi>to a liking of the Fruit that was produc'd where you reign. While your Wit and Judgment aw'd me no less than your Greatness, your indulging Smiles embolden'd me to the honour of this Address. 'Tis to that condescending Goodness that I presume to Devote this Essay, as an Earnest of what I will strive to do, to gain a better Title to your generous Encouragement. Nor cou'd I easily have secur'd a Patron to so general a <pb xml:id="ep000645-003-a"/>Satire, had I not happily fix'd on your Lordship, whom all allow to be not only free from the Defects it exposes, but enjoy'd with all their opposite Perfections. Thus your very name will stamp a value on the Piece, and recommend it to the most Difficult, who will fear to mislike what they'll know has been grac'd and made authentic by your favourable Reception. </p>
        <p>Here, my Lord, the Custom of Dedications calls upon me, prompting me to put on the Poet, to draw the Patron; and though most Performances of this kind are as full of Flattery as the Plays are of Satire, I might attempt your Lordships Character without being obnoxious to that Censure. But what Pen will dare engage so Lofty and Difficult a Theme? Some of the Best have modestly declin'd it, and been reduc'd to speak like the rest of the World, who strive to give some Idea of your Lordship, by that of <hi>The Fine Gentleman</hi>; a Character you maintain among the Brave, the Witty, and the Fair, by so undisputed a Title as confirms you a living honour to your great Ancestors, even to the glorious Name of Boyle, that has so long been an honour to this Island and its Neighbour. There are sublime Beauties that admit of no shadow, which, like the Sun, dazzle even while admir'd by Reflection: Things so conspicuous are not to be illustrated with Ink. Besides, I ought to consider that I speak of you to your self; and tho' you still most unwillingly suffer your self to be mov'd out of your admirable temper, 'tis known how dangerous 'tis to make you exert your Patience beyond the Bounds <pb xml:id="ep000645-003-b"/>you prescribe it. The Bravest are the most modest; thus Praise too often offends those to whom 'tis most due, and they shun it no less than they seek to deserve it. This Consideration, my Lord, checks my presumptuous Zeal, and confines me to a silent Admiration of that Worth, which, as it endears you to all mankind, makes me ambitious of being known, </p>

        <head>PREFACE TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>I Am almost asham'd to mention the extraordinary Success of a Play which I my self must condemn; yet I am glad I was not mistaken in my opinion of the generous Audience, which was so indulgent, that I'm willing to think I was the more kindly us'd for being a Stranger. I will strive to deserve the Favor better by attempting something more correct than this Play, which, tho it makes no unpleasant Figure on the Stage, and is thought sufficiently entertaining, is not altogether dispos'd as I cou'd have wish'd. For, I would have the Plot, Conversation and Humour begin and run through the whole Play together, a thing but seldom practis'd of late. I cou'd not follow that method in this, because I began it upon two Acts suppos'd to be written by a person now dead, and given me by Mr. Verbruggen. Though there is no manner of Business in 'em, nor the least prospect of any, I lik'd 'em so well as to continue 'em and fit a Plot to 'em, but as the Lovers were not brought together yet, and there are none but genteel Characters in 'em, I was oblig'd to make my three Acts so very long, that (when I brought 'em to be acted) without the other two, they were found to exceed by above an Act the due length of a Play. This oblig'd me not only to strike out intirely Mr. Verbruggen's two Acts, but to shorten mine, and with some alterations make 'em Five. I also alter'd some Characters that I might use those two Acts another time: (For, I think 'em too pretty to be lost.) But I have not borrow'd the least word or hint out of 'em; for, tho there is a satirical Wit and a mercurial Spark in them, as well as in this Play, they are somewhat <pb xml:id="ep000645-004-b"/>different, besides those are general humours which almost every Writer takes a priviledge of bringing in where he pleases. I thought my self oblig'd to say so much, because some People either maliciously or through a mistake have reported that the two first Acts are not mine. I am willing to own a Debt, when I borrow, contrary to the Example▪ of most Dramatick Writers. Plantus and Terence borrow'd from the Greek; I wou'd borrow, from my own Countrymen, but Moliere and most of 'em have been so glean'd, that there's scarce any thing left. I have far'd better among the Italians, for I must own my self indebted to 'em for the hint of the two Scenes where Love is made in Jest, as also for some Speeches and Thoughts here and there, and were their Author known I wou'd name him. When ever any thing in foreign Plays will seem to me fit to divert us here, I will freely make use of it, and as freely acknowledge it. Mr. Shadwell said very justly, that we do not borrow from Foreigners out of Poverty, but out of Laziness. Nor will I value the base and notoriously false Insinuations of envious impotent Poetasters, and, least of all, those of a pitiful conceited noisie scribling wou'd-be-quack, below naming; one whose wretched Riddles, Songs, &amp;c. were deny'd a place in my late Miscellanies, tho, <hi>like other things of his</hi>, recommended <hi>by himself</hi>, as if written by a Lady. Such an invidious Traducer is well coupled with an idle sharping Dialoguemonger, whose Zany he is; like him, so base as to detract, in the most barbarous manner, from those who never wrong'd him, and so cowardly as to deny it: But they might as well charge those of ruining themselves by Marriage who have not yet committed that Folly, as of ruining a Bookseller by Books, by which he owns he was a gainer: Had I but room, I wou'd stigmatize that Brace of Libellers; for, how despicable soever such Scoundrels may be, they are to be fear'd as well as hated; for, what is more to be hated than a profess'd Lyar, or more to be fear'd than a publick Slanderer. </p>
        <p>Let me leave this ungrateful Subject to acknowledge my obligations to Mr. <hi>John Eccles</hi>, who not only set my three Dialogues to most charming Notes, but humour'd the Words to Admiration; we need not fear Music shou'd decline, while we have so fine a Genius to support and raise it. </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE <hi>Spoken by Mr. </hi>Bowen <hi>in a Riding-Dress</hi>. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>I've been t' invite our Friends at Epsom hither, </l>
          <l>But fear we must expect but▪ few this weather. </l>
          <l>Here for a triple scarcity we pine, </l>
          <l>Of Wits, of Beaux, and what's yet worse, of Coyn. </l>
          <l>Lord! what a Croud I met upon the Road! </l>
          <l>Try'd Virgins, going to lay down their Load, </l>
          <l>Squires, Bullies, Rakes, and Fops, in jolting Coaches stow'd. </l>
          <l>Sharpers like Captains; Lawyers Clerks, like Beaux, </l>
          <l>And freckled Country-Wives, in new old fashion'd Cloths. </l>
          <l>New Married Fools, with hollow▪ Eye and Cheek, </l>
          <l>Going to see their Vnkle for a Week, </l>
          <l>And batter'd Sinners that have sprung a Leak. </l>
          <l>Kind Cuckolds, to see Spouse's Brat at Nurse, </l>
          <l>And College Quacks, to purge the Body and the Purse. </l>
          <l>Fat Priests, who Coach it while lean Curates drudge, </l>
          <l>And their Parishioners on Foot must trudge. </l>
          <l>Setters, and Brothers of the Oak and Dice, </l>
          <l>And Masks new plaster'd, Cullies to intice. </l>
          <l>Cits, who stopt Payment, to take Country-houses; </l>
          <l>Some, slyty riding with each others Spouses: </l>
          <l>For, Sparks so scarce this time of Action grow, </l>
          <l>Cits must e'en Cuckold one another now. </l>
          <l>Ev'n Prentices, on Hacknies themselves priding, </l>
          <l>Now Whip and Spur to run out Cash are riding: </l>
          <l>Then fairly run-away for fear of Chiding. </l>
          <l>I fancy, none but those will stay in Town </l>
          <l>Who, like us here, want Money to go down. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000645-005-b"/>
          <l>Let's see! shall we have Charges at this Play? </l>
          <l>Faith that's more than some had at their Third-day. </l>
          <l>We must Prorogue the House, shou'd this not take, </l>
          <l>In Pity then pray spare it for our sake. </l>
          <l>A young Play-writer, when we act his first, </l>
          <l>Without Damnation here enough is Curst. </l>
          <l>Oh! he has then a most Poetic Face, </l>
          <l>And looks▪ stay, let me see— just like an Ass; </l>
          <l>Nay, what you'll scarce believe, a Poet prays. </l>
          <l>Then the next minute, with a frightful mein▪ </l>
          <l>Vds bloody Bones he crys, they spoil this Scene. </l>
          <l>If you seem dull, like him, he's mighty sick, </l>
          <l>Cut off a Line, you cut him to the quick. </l>
          <l>At the least hiss you'd swear his Soul were fled, </l>
          <l>But a round Clap can raise him from the Dead: </l>
          <l>He's Cock-a-hoop, and scarce can talk to you, </l>
          <l>E'gad he crys, I knew the Play wou'd do. </l>
          <l>But if another hiss his Ears but reaches, </l>
          <l>Down sinks at once his heart into his Breeches. </l>
          <l>Yet scorns our Writer threatning Foes to fear; </l>
          <l>The generous Britons will a Stranger spare: </l>
          <l>Thus low the Frenchman bows— then learns of you to dare. </l>
          <l>His Satire bites but like a Lovers kiss, </l>
          <l>And none of you, he's sure, can tak't a miss. </l>

          <p>Stay, let me tell that— Why, a Beau is a kind of a two-legg'd thing, that talks, and walks, and dances, <pb n="10" xml:id="ep000645-012-a"/>and sings, and dresses, and looks like something between a Man and a Woman, that seldom keeps a secret better than the latter, and strives to outdo 'em in taking care of the outside, conscious there's little within. It rises to go to Bed, is two hours at the Toilette a dressing, dispatching of Duns, and spoiling gilt paper to dispatch it as Billets Doux, sometimes to its sweet self, and all day making Love to its dear Carcass and sweeter Cloths. </p>

          <speaker>Gay. </speaker>
          <p>Oh, yes; now Beau is every thing: there's your Town, Court, Camp, Sea, Church, and Country Beau. Sometimes Beau is Mr. Smerk with his diminutive Band and powder'd Bob: sometimes Dash a Lawyers Clerk, that pomatum's his Face, washes it with Milk and Water, and is two hours turning up his hair at night, that it may sit in Curls the next morning. There are dirty Beaux, and Beau Footmen too, and old Beaux in abundance! Nay, now a Man's a Beau if he has but a clean Handkercheif. </p>

Let him read good books moderately, but chiefly the great book of the world, not to be found with Pedants. It costs so little more to breed a man like a Gentleman, than it does to breed others like Clowns, that I wonder there are so many of the latter with good Paternal Estates. </p>
