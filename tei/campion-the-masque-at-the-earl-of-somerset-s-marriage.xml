            <head>The description of a Masque, Presented in the Banqueting roome at Whitehall, On St. Stephens night last: At the Mariage of the right Honourable the Earle of Somerset, &amp; the right noble the Lady Frances Howard. </head>
            <p>IN ancient times, when any man sought to shadowe or heighten his Inuention, he had store of feyned persons readie for his purpose; As <hi>Satyres, Nymphes </hi>&amp; their like: such were then in request and beliefe among the vulgar. But in our dayes, although they haue not vtterly lost their vse, yet finde they so litle credit, that our moderne writers haue rather transferd their fictions to the persons of Enchaunters &amp; Commaunders of Spirits, as that excellent Poet <hi>Torquato Tasso </hi>hath done, and many others. </p>
            <p>In imitation of them (having a presentation in hand for Persons of high State) I grounded my whole Inuention vpon Inchauntmens and severall transformations: The work-manship whereof was <pb xml:id="ep000324-003-a"/>vndertaken by M. Constantine an Italian, Architect to our late Prince Henry: but he being too much of him selfe, and no way to be drawne to impart his intentions, fayled so farre in the assurance he gaue, that the mayne inuention euen at the last cast, was of force drawne into a farre narrower compasse then was from the beginning intended: The description whereof as it was performed, I will as briefely as I can deliver. The place wherein the Maske was presented, being the Banquetting house at White Hall: the vpper part, where the State is placed, was Theatred with Pillars, Scaffolds, and all things answerable to the sides of the Roome. At the lower end of the Hall before the Sceane was made an Arch Tryvmphall, passing beautifull, which enclosed the whole Workes: The Sceane it selfe (the Curtaine being drawne) was in this manner diuided. </p>
            <p>On the vpper part there was formed a Skye with Clowdes very arteficially shadowed. On either side of the Sceane belowe was set a high Promontory, and on either of them stood three large pillars of golde: the one Promontory was bounded with a Rocke standing in the Sea, the other with a Wood; In the midst betwene them apeared a Sea in perspectiue with ships, some cunningly painted, some arteficially sayling. On the front of the Sceane, on either side was a beautifull garden, with sixe seates a peece to receaue the Maskers: behinde them the mayne Land, and in the middest a paire of stayres made exceeding curiously in the forme of a Schalop shell. <pb xml:id="ep000324-003-b"/>And in this manner was the eye first of all entertayned. After the King, Queene, and Prince were placed, and preparation was made for the beginning of the Maske, there entred foure Squires, who as soone as they approached neare the Presence, humbly bowing themselues, spake as followeth. </p>

            <p>Towards the end of this speech, two Enchanters, and two Enchanteresses appeare: Error first, in a skin coate scaled like a Serpent, and an antick habit painted with Snakes, a haire of curled Snakes, and a deformed visard. With him Rumor in a skin coate full of winged Tongues, and ouer it an antick robe, on his head a Cap like a tongue, with a large paire of wings to it. </p>
            <p>Curiosity in a skin coate full of eyes, and an antick habit ouer it, a fantastick Cap full of Eyes. </p>
            <p>Credulity in the like habit painted with eares, and an antick Cap full of eares. </p>
            <p>When they had whispered a while as if they had reioyced at the wrongs which they had done to the Knights, the Musick and their Daunce began: strait forth rusht the foure Windes confusedly, the Easterne winde in a skin coate of the colour of the Sun-rising, <pb xml:id="ep000324-005-a"/>with a yellow haire, and wings both on his shoulders and feete. </p>
            <p>The Westerne Winde in a skin coate of darke crimson, with crimson haire and wings. </p>
            <p>The Southerne Winde in a darke russet skin coate, haire and wings sutable. </p>
            <p>The Northern winde in a grisled skin coate, with haire and wings accordingly. </p>
            <p>After them in confusion came the foure Elements: Earth, in a skin coate of grasse greene, a mantle painted full of trees, plants, and flowers, and on his head an oke growing. </p>
            <p>Water, in a skin coate waved, with a mantle full of fishes, on his head a Dolphin. </p>
            <p>Ayre, in a skye-coloured skin coate, with a mantle painted with Fowle, and on his head an Eagle. </p>
            <p>Fire, in a skin coate, and a mantle painted with flames: on his head a cap of flames, with a Salamander in the midst thereof. </p>
            <p>Then entred the foure parts of the earth in a confused measure. </p>
            <p>Europe in the habit of an Empresse, with an Emperiall Crowne on her head. </p>
            <pb xml:id="ep000324-005-b"/>

            <p>Africa like a Queene of the Moores, with a crown. </p>
            <p>America in a skin coate of the colour of the iuyce of Mulberies, on her head large round brims of many coloured feathers, and in the midst of it a small Crowne. </p>
            <p>All these hauing daunced together in a strange kinde of confusion; past away, by foure and foure. </p>
            <p>At which time, Eternity appeared in a long blew Taffata robe, painted with Starres, and on her head a Crowne. </p>
            <p>Next, came the three Destinies, in long robes of white Taffata like aged women, with Garlands of Narcissus Flowers on their heads, and in their left hands they carried distaffes according to the descriptions of Plato and Catullus, but in their right hands they carried altogether a Tree of Golde. </p>
            <p>After them, came Harmony with nine Musitians more, in long Taffata robes and caps of Tinsell, with Garlands guilt, playing and singing this Song. </p>
