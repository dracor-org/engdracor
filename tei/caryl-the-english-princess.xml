        <l>YOu must to day your Appetite prepare </l>
        <l>For a plain English Treat of homely Fare: </l>
        <l>We neither Bisque, nor Olliàs shall advance </l>
        <l>From Spanish Novel, or from French Romance; </l>
        <l>Nor shall we charm your Ears, or feast your Eyes </l>
        <l>With Turkey-Works, or Indian Rarityes: </l>
        <l>But to plain Hollinshead and down-right Stow </l>
        <l>We the coarse Web of our Contrivance owe. </l>
        <l>Since Laces, Ribbands, and such Modish geer </l>
        <l>Fetcht from abroad are now forbidden here, </l>
        <l>Amongst those Forreign Toys (for ought we know) </l>
        <l>Fine Plots for Plays may be included too. </l>
        <l>Greece, the first Mistress of the Tragick Muse, </l>
        <l>To grace her Stage, did her own Heroes chuse; </l>
        <l>Their Pens adorn'd their Native Swords; and thus </l>
        <l>What was not Grecian past for Barbarous. </l>
        <l>On us our Country the same duty lays, </l>
        <l>And English Wit should English Valour raise. </l>
        <l>Why should our Land to any Land submit </l>
        <l>In choice of Heroes, or in height of Wit? </l>
        <l>This made him write, who never writ till now, </l>
        <l>Only to shew what better Pens should do. </l>
        <l>And for his Pains he hopes he shall be thought </l>
        <l>(Though a bad Poet,) a good Patriot. </l>

        <l>RIchard is dead; and now begins your Reign: </l>
        <l>Let not the Tyrant live in you again. </l>
        <l>For though one Tyrant be a Nation's Curse, </l>
        <l>Yet Commonwealths of Tyrants are much worse: </l>
        <l>Their Name is Legion; And a Rump (you know) </l>
        <l>In Cruelty all Richards does outgo. </l>
        <l>First then by Acts of Grace your Power declare: </l>
        <l>Newly install'd, all Princes gracious are; </l>
        <l>All lesser Crimes within their Pardon fall; </l>
        <l>And Poëts Sins are not held Capital. </l>
        <l>For your own sake you must some Mercy shew: </l>
        <l>Act not the Tyrant's Part, lest we act you. </l>
        <l>A formal Critick with his wise Grimace </l>
        <l>Will on the Stage appear with no ill grace: </l>
        <l>Most of that Trade in this Censorious Age </l>
        <l>Have little of the Poët, but his Rage: </l>
        <l>Perhaps old Johnson's Gall may fill their Pen; </l>
        <l>But where's the Iudgment, and the Salt of Ben? </l>
        <l>Yet for himself our Authour does declare </l>
        <l>All that sit here, his Lawful Iudges are: </l>
        <l>For 'tis but just, that in our lawless days, </l>
        <l>Since all Men write, all Men should judge of Plays. </l>
