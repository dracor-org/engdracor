          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Very much congratulate this occasion, though I readily acknowledge, that this poor Present brings small advantage to any, but him that gives it; who gains thereby the opportunity of publickly owning those great respects he shall alwayes pay your name, and of setting his hand to a paper, as a voluntary surrendry to you, of all his good Wishes, and Services. If the Treat he provided be not so well drest, or serv'd up, as it ought to be, pray let him beg pardon, with that common, yet necessary excuse of a young House-keeper, one not well settled, and scarce with any thing in readiness. Suppose his Garden newly planted, very little, or no fruit to be expected the first year, and the unexperienced Planter, not as yet well skill'd, in keeping off the cold winds, and nipping Frosts; howsoever he intreats you to receive what he has rais'd, and to eat kindly of his first-fruits, with which the greatest men have been alwayes pleased, and Heaven claims them before other off rings. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000642-003-a"/>
        <p>Now dear Sir, as I once lov'd you with your other Brothers, so those hopeful Gentlemen being dead, I will center my good wishes on you; may you joyn their virtues and sweetness to your own, may you be one for all, to your Relations, and Friends, and may you like your excellent Father, be as eminently concern'd in the World, and as honourably prais'd by it, to the great satisfaction of </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WHo dares be witty now, and with just rage </l>
        <l>Disturb the vice, and follies of the Age? </l>
        <l>With Knaves and Fools, Satyr's a dang'rous fault, </l>
        <l>They will not let you rub their sores with salt. </l>
        <l>Else Rose-streets Ambuscade shall break your head, </l>
        <l>And life in Verse, shall lay the Poet dead. </l>
        <l>Since therefore such unequal Iudges sit, </l>
        <l>Who for suspicion punish men of Wit, </l>
        <l>'Twill be self-preservation to be dull, </l>
        <l>It cracks the credit but preserves the skull. </l>
        <l>Henceforth live long and undisturbed lives, </l>
        <l>Your Countrey-Worships, and your tawdry Wives, </l>
        <l>The flaunting Punk and Ladies eldest Son, </l>
        <l>All such who are by mutual crimes undone; </l>
        <l>Like Lakes look green and flourish to the Eye, </l>
        <l>But yet for want of stirring putrifie. </l>
        <l>For I am told that Fop, and eke the Clown, </l>
        <l>Iointly subscribe Petitions in each Town, </l>
        <l>And swear all Satyr with bold truth shall down. </l>
        <l>Why, cry they, What has wit to do with me? </l>
        <l>With this Mans folly, or his knavery, </l>
        <l>It is not fit we lose our property. </l>
        <l>We'll pound the Poet up in small extent, </l>
        <l>Far from his arbitrary Government. </l>
        <l>Birth-right is birth-right, and he shall not rail, </l>
        <l>We are undone, if common sense prevail. </l>
        <l>Meum and tuum now shall be the rule, </l>
        <l>The <foreign xml:lang="lat">Magna Charta </foreign>for the Knave and Fool. </l>
        <l>Therefore the Poet that designs this Treat, </l>
        <l>Ventures to serve up light and innocent meat. </l>
        <l>And since high season'd sauce don't well agree, </l>
        <l>Excuse a strangers plainer Cookery. </l>
        <l>For to extreams you do the Poet drive, </l>
        <l>And make him leave his best prerogative. </l>
        <l>So the poor Beaver lest he prove a prey, </l>
        <l>Bites off his dearest part, and throws away. </l>

Behold most noble Cunophilus, a Beauty in these Meads, which Flora her self would blush at and be proud of, behold how Natures pretty Wildness does exceed all the feeble Endeavours of emulous Art, when her Speech was on the sudden interrupted by the clamorous Importunity of a pretty chattering Animal, which by it's Colour did seem to be of the Dominican Order among the Fowl, and was in Brief a Magpy. At first we considered whether Joy or Anger or what Passion it might be, had surpriz'd the chequer'd Fowl, and caus'd its sudden Extasie, when lo! hard by we spy'd that garrulous and domestick Bird, vulgarly call'd a Hen, which soon became more lowd and sonorous than the other. The Cause of which we soon perceiv'd to be a sudden Joy it had conceived for it's safe and happy Delivery of an oviparous Production, which no sooner had the unopining Bird deserted; but its false and chattering Neighbour leaped hastily on the forsaken Birth. And after making a little Fracture on the too brittle Defence, (I mean the Shell) the gready immoral and voracious Fowl did in a Moment absorb all the precious Liquor it contain'd. </p>

Yet I am heartily pleased for two Reasons, first, to see these old Quarrels between two good Families so handsomly ended. And then that my Son in Law carries himself so prettily amongst 'em. In Troth I find he is a pretty Fellow, and in Troth you are all pretty Fellows, and may you all live to be as lusty as I am, at my years— Hem— There's your Lungs in Troth. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE </head>
        <head type="sub">Written by Mr. Shadwel▪ Spoken by Mrs. Barry. </head>
        <l>OH! How severe is our poor Poets Fate! </l>
        <l>Who in this barren Trade begins so late. </l>
        <l>True Wit's no longer currant, 'tis cry'd down, </l>
        <l>And all your half-wits into knavery grown. </l>
        <l>Those who once lov'd the Stage, are now in years, </l>
        <l>And leave good Poets for dull Pamphleteers; </l>
        <l>Nay, for the worst of Rascals, Libellers. </l>
        <l>In none of these will the young Sparks delight, </l>
        <l>They never read, and scorn all those that write. </l>
        <l>They only come the Boxes to survey, </l>
        <l>Laugh, roar, and bawl, but never hear the Play. </l>
        <l>In Monkey's tricks they pass the time away, </l>
        <l>At least, the Poet hopes, th've done to day. </l>
        <l>The Graver sort, he's sure, have so much Sense, </l>
        <l>That they'l ne're damn him for his first Offence. </l>
        <l>He may take warning, and fling off this Itch, </l>
        <l>That does poor Poets Hearts so much bewitch, </l>
        <l>And, in a duller way, drudge and grow rich. </l>
        <l>Ye have no harden'd Malefactor here; </l>
        <l>He ne're before did at this Bar appear. </l>
        <l>If he should suffer, the first time he's in, </l>
        <l>'Twere hard, as for a Girl, fresh, at sixteen, </l>
        <l>To meet, at the first Venture, the mishap </l>
        <l>To lose her Maidenhead, and get a Clap. </l>
