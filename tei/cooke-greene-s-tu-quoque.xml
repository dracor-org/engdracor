        <head>To the Reader. </head>
        <p>TO gratulate the loue and memory of my worthy friend the Author, and my entirely beloued Fellow, the Actor, I could not chuse being in the way iust when this Play was to be published in Priut, but to prefixe some token of my affection to either in the frontispire of the Booke. For the Gentleman that wrote it, his Poem it selfe can better speake his praise, then any Oratory from me. Nor can I tell whether this worke was diuulged with his consent or no: but howsoeuer, since it hath past the Test of the stage with so generall an applause, pitty it were but it should likewise haue the honour of the Presse. As for Maister Greene, all that I will speake of him (and that without flattery) is this (if I were worthy to censure) there was not an Actor of his nature in his time of better ability in performance of what he vndertooke; more applaudent by the Audience, of greater grace at the Court, or of more general loue in the Citty, and so with this briefe character of his memory, I commit him to his rest. </p>
