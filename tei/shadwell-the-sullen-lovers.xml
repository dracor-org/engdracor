        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Reader, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THe success, of this Play, as it was much more then it deserv'd, so was much more than I expected: Especially in this very Critical age, when every man pretends to be a Judge, and some, that never read Three Playes in their lives, and never understood one, are as positive in their Judgement of Playes, as if they were all Iohnsons. But had I been us'd with all the severity imaginable, I should patiently have submitted to my Fate; not like the rejected Authors of our time, who when their▪ Playes are damn'd, will strut, and huff it out, and laugh at the Ignorance of the Age: Or like some other of our Modern 〈◊〉 that declare they are resolv'd to justifie their Playes with their Swords (though perhaps their Courage is as little as their Wi●● such as peep through their loop-holes in the Theatre, to see who looks grum upon their Playes: and if they spy a Gentle Squire making Faces, he poor soul must be Hector'd till he likes 'em, while the more stubborn Bully-Rock damm's, <pb xml:id="ep000737-005-a"/>and is safe: 〈…〉 in 〈◊〉 choice of 〈…〉 had 〈◊〉 pretend they cannot 〈…〉 will 〈◊〉, and look big upon the success of an ill play 〈◊〉 full of Songs and Dances, (which have that constraint upon 'em too, that they seldome seem to come in willingly;) When in such Playes the Composer and the Dancing-Master are the best Poets, and yet the unmerciful Scribler would rob the● of all the Honour. </p>
        <p>I am so far from valuing my self (as 〈…〉) upon this Play, that perhaps no man is a 〈…〉 of it then my self; yet if any thing 〈…〉 made me proud of it, It would have 〈…〉 Favour and Countenance it receiv'd from His Majesty and their Royal Highnesses. </p>
        <p>But I could not perswade my self that they were so favourable to the Play for the Merit of it, but out of a Princely Generosity, to encourage a young●beginner, that did what he could to please them, and that otherwise might have been baulk'd for ever: 'Tis to this I owe the success of the Play, and am as far from presumption of my own merits in it, as one ought to be who receives an Alms. </p>
        <p>The first hint I receiv'd was from the report of a Play of Molieres of three Acts, called <hi>Les Fasch●●x▪ </hi>upon which I wrote a great part of this before I read that; And after it came to my hands, I found so little for my use (having before upon that hint design'd <pb xml:id="ep000737-005-b"/>the 〈…〉 I have made use of but two short 〈◊〉 (<hi>Viz▪</hi>) the first Scene in the Second Act between Stafford and Roger, and Molier's story of Piquette, which I have translated into Back-gammon, both of them so vary'd you would not know them. But I freely confess my Theft, and am asham'd on't, though I have the example of some that never yet wrote Play without stealing most of it; And (like Men that lye so long▪ till they believe themselves) at length, by continual▪ Thieving, reckon their stolne goods their own too▪ which is so ignoble a thing, that I cannot but believe that he that makes a common practice of stealing other mens Witt, would, if he could, with the same safety steale any thing else. </p>
        <p>I have in this Play, as neer as I could, observed the three Unities, of Time, Place, and Action; The time of the Drama does not exceed six houres, the place is in a very narrow Compass, and the Main-Action of the Play, upon which all the rest depend, is the Sullen-Love betwixt Stanford and Emilia, which kind of love is onely proper to their Characters: I have here, as often as I could naturally, kept the Scenes unbroken, which (though it be not so much practised, or so well understood, by the English) yet among the French-Poets is accompted a great Beauty; but after these frivolous excuses the want of design in the Play has been objected against me; which fault (though I may endeavour a little to extenuate) I <pb xml:id="ep000737-006-a"/>dare not absolutely deny: I conceive, with all submission to better Judgments, that no man ought to expect such Intrigues in the little actions of Comedy, as are requir'd in Playes of a higher Nature: but in Playes of Humour, where there are so many Characters as there are in this, there is yet less design to be expected: for, if after I had form'd three or four forward prating Fopps in the Play, I had made it full of Plott, and Business; at the latter end, where the turnes ought to be many, and suddenly following one another, I must have let fall the humour, which I thought wou'd be pleasanter then Intrigues could have been without it; and it would have been easier to me to have made a Plott then to hold up the Humour. </p>
        <p>Another Objection, that has been made by some, is, that there is the same thing over and over: which I do not apprehend, unless they blame the unity of the action, yet <hi>Horace de Arte Poetica</hi>, sayes, <q>Sit quod vis, simplex duntaxat, &amp; unum. </q>Or whether it be the carrying on of the humours to the last, which the same Author directs me to doe. <q>
            <l>Si quid inexpertum Scenae committis, &amp; audes </l>
            <l>Personam formare novam, Ser●et●● ad Imu●● </l>
            <l>Qualis ab incepto processerit, &amp; sibi constet. </l>
          </q>
        </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000737-006-b"/>
        <p>I have endeavour'd to represent variety of Humours (most of the persons of the Play differing in their Characters from one another) which was the practise of <hi>Ben Iohnson</hi>, whom I think all Drammatick Poets ought to imitate, though none are like to come near; he being the onely person that appears to me to have made perfect Representations of Humane Life: most other Authors that I ever read, either have wilde Romantick Tales, wherein they strein Love and Honour to that Ridiculous height, that it becomes Burlesque: or in their lower Comoedies content themselves with one or two Humours at most, and those not near so perfect Characters as the admirable Iohnson alwayes made, who never wrote Comedy without seven or eight considerable Humours. I never saw one except that of Falstaffe that was in my judgment comparable to any of Iohnson's considerable Humours: You will pardon this digression when I tell you he is the man, of all the World, I most passionately admire for his Excellency in Drammatick- Poetry. </p>
        <p>Though I have known some of late so Insolent to say, that <hi>Ben Iohnson </hi>wrote his best Playes without Wit; imagining, that all the Wit in Playes consisted in bringing two persons upon the Stage to break Jests, and to bob one another, which they call Repartie, not considering that there is more wit and invention requir'd in the finding out good Humor, and <pb xml:id="ep000737-007-a"/>Matter 〈…〉 reparties. For, 〈…〉 of a Humor, ● Man is confin'd not to 〈◊〉 from the Character, and oblig'd to say nothing but what is proper to it: but in the Playes which have been 〈◊〉 of late, there is no such thing as perfect Character, but the two chief persons are most commonly a Swearing, Drinking, Whoring, Ruffian for a Lover, and an impudent ill-bred tonirig for a Mistress, and these are the fine people of the Play; and there is that Latitude in this, that almost any thing is proper for them to say; but their chief Subject is bawdy, and profaness, which they call <hi>brisk writing</hi>, when the most dissolute of Men, that rellish those things well enough in private, are chok'd at e'm in publick: and, methinks, if there were nothing but the ill Manners of it, it should make Poets avoid that Indecent way of Writing. </p>
        <p>But, perhaps you may think me as impertinent as any one I represent; that, having so many faults of my own, shou'd take the liberty to Judge of others, to impeach my fellow Criminalls: I must confess it is very ungenerous to accuse those that modestly confess their own Errors; but positive men, that Justifie all their faults, are Common Enemies, that no man ought to spare, prejudicial to all Societies they live in, destructive to all Communication, alwayes indeavouring Magisterially to impose upon our understandings, against the Freedome of Mankind: These ought no more to be 〈◊〉 amongst us, then wild beasts: <pb xml:id="ep000737-007-b"/>for no corrections that can be laid upon e'm are of power to reforme e'm; and certainly it was a positive Foole that Salomon spoke of, when he said, <hi>bray him in a Mortar, and yet he will retain his folly. </hi>
        </p>
        <p>But I have troubled you too long with this Discourse, and am to aske your pardon for it, and the many faults you will find in the Play; and beg you will believe, that whatever I have said of it, was intended not in Justification, but Excuse of it: Look upon it, as it really was, wrote in haste, by a Young Writer, and you will easily pardon it; especially when you know that the best of our Drammatick Writers have wrote very ill Playes at first, nay some of e'm have wrote several before they could get one to be Acted; and their best Playes were made wi●● great expence of labour and time. Nor can you expect a very Correct Play, under a Years pains at the least, from the Wittiest Man of the Nation; It is so difficult a thing to write well in this kind. Men of quality, that write for their pleasure, will not trouble themselves with exactness in their Playes; and those, that write for profit, would find too little incouragement for so much paines as a correct Play would require. </p>

        <l>By all his interest in his Countrey can. </l>
        <l>They raise their friends, but in one day arise </l>
        <l>'Gainst one poor Poet, all these Enemies: </l>
        <l>For so he has observ'd you alwayes are, </l>
        <l>And against all that write maintain a Warr. </l>
        <l>What shall he give you composition now? </l>
        <l>Alass, he knowes not what you will allow. </l>
        <l>He has no cautionary-Song, nor Dance, </l>
        <l>That might the Treaty of his Peace advance. </l>
        <l>No kinde Romantick Lovers in his Play, </l>
        <l>To sigh and whine out passion, such as may </l>
        <l>Charme Waitingwomen with Heroick Chime, </l>
        <l>And still resolve to live and die in Rhime; </l>
        <l>Such as your Eares with Love, and Honour feast, </l>
        <l>And play at Crambo for three houres at least: </l>
        <l>That Fight, and wooe in Verse in the same breath, </l>
        <l>And make Similitudes, and Love in Death: </l>
        <l>— But if you love a fool, he bid me say, </l>
        <l>He has great choyce to shew you in his Play; </l>
        <l>(To doe you service) I am one to day. </l>

        <l>Yet a worse malady then both is bred, </l>
        <l>For Poetry now reigneth in their stead: </l>
        <l>The Itch of writing Playes, the more's the pity, </l>
        <l>At once has seis'd the Town, the Court, and City. </l>
        <l>Amongst the rest the Poet of this day▪ </l>
        <l>By meer infection has produc'd a Play. </l>
        <l>Once his hot fit was strong when he was bold </l>
        <l>To write, but while you judge hee's in the Cold, </l>
        <l>Yet pray consider, few of you but may </l>
        <l>Be given up so farre to write a Play: </l>
        <l>If not for his, for your own sakes be kinde, </l>
        <l>And give that mercy which you hope to finde. </l>
