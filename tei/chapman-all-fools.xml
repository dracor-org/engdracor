No, when he saw twas but her humour (for his owne quietnesse sake) hee made a Backe-doore to his house for conuenience, gott a Bell to his fore doore, and had an odd fashion in ringing, by which shee and her Mayde knew him; and would stand talking to his next neighbour to prolong time, that all thinges might be ridde clenly out a the way before he came, for the credite of his Wife: This was wisedome now, for a mans owne-quiet. </p>

          <speaker>Ualerio. </speaker>
          <p>THe course of the world (like the life of man) is said to be deuided into seuerall ages: As wee into Infancie, Childhood, Youth, and so forward to Old-age: So the World into the Golden age, the Siluer, the Brasse, the <pb xml:id="ep000330-035-b"/>Iron, the Leaden, the Wooden; and now into this present age, which wee tearme the Horned age: not that but former ages haue inioyde this benefite as well as our times; but that in ours it is more common, and neuerthelesse pretious. It is said, that in the Golden age of the world, the vse of Gold was not then knowne: an argument of the simplicitie of that age, least therefore succeeding ages should hereafter impute the same fault to vs, which wee lay vpon the first age; that wee liuing in the Horned age of the world, should not vnderstand the vse, the vertue, the honour, and the very royaltie of the Horne; I will in briefe sound the prayses thereof, that they who are alreadie in possession of it, may beare their heades aloft, as beeing proud of such loftie accowtrements: And they that are but in possibilitie, may be rauisht with a desire to be in possession. </p>
          <p>A Trophey so honorable, and vnmatchably powerfull, that it is able to raise any man from a Beggar to an Emperours fellow, a Dukes fellow, a Noble-mans fellow, Aldermans fellow; so glorious, that it deserues to be worne (by most opinions) in the most conspicuous place about a man: For what worthier Crest can you beare then the Horne? which if it might be seene with our mortall eyes, what a wonderfull spectacle would there be? and how highly they would rauish the beholders? But their substaunce is incorporall, not falling vnder sence, nor mixt of the grosse concretion of Elementes, but a quintessence beyond them; a spirituall essence inuisible, and euerlasting. </p>
          <p>And this hath been the cause that many men haue called their beeing in question, whether there be such a thing in verum natura, or not; because they are not to be seene: as though nothing were that were not to be seene? Who euer saw the Winde? yet what wonderfull effectes are seene of it? It driues the cloudes, yet no man sees it: It rockes the House, beares downe Trees, Castles, Steeples, yet who sees it? In like sort does your Horne, it swelles the Forehead, yet none sees it: it rockes the Cradle, yet none sees it: so that you <pb xml:id="ep000330-036-a"/>plainely perceiue Sence, is no Iudge of Essence. The Moone to any mans sence, seemes to be Horned; yet who knowes not the Moone to be euer perfectly round: So likewise your Heades seeme euer to be round, when in deed they are oftentimes Horned: for their originall, it is vnsearchable: Naturall they are not; for there is Beast borne with Hornes, more then with Teeth: Created they were not, for Ex nihilo nihil sit; Then will you aske mee, How came they into the world? I know not; but I am sure Women brought them into this part of the world, howsoeuer some Doctors are of opinion that they came in with the Diuell: and not vnlike; for, as the Diuell brought Sinne into the worlde; but the Woman brought it to the Man: so it may very well be that the Diuell brought Hornes into the world; but the Woman brought them to the man, </p>
          <p>For their power it is generall ouer the world, no Nation so barbarous, no Countrey so proude, but doth equall homage to the Horne. Europa when shee was carried through the Sea by the Saturnian Bull, was said (for feare of falling) to haue held by the Horne: and what is this but a plaine shewing to vs, that all Europa, which tooke name from that Europa, should likewise hold by the Horne: So that I say, it is vniuersall ouer the face of the world, general ouer the face of Europe, and common ouer the face of this Countrey. What Cittie, what Towne, what Village, what Streete? nay what House can quit it selfe of this prerogatiue? I haue read that the Lion once made a Proclamation through all the Forrest, that all Horned Beastes should depart foorthwith vpon paine of death: If this Proclamation should be made through our Forrest, Lord what pressing, what running, what flying, would there be euen from all the parts of it? he that had but a bunch of Flesh in his head would away: and some foolishly fearefull, would imagine the shadow of his Eares to be Hornes: Ahlas how desart would this Forrest be left? </p>
          <pb xml:id="ep000330-036-b"/>
          <p>To conclude for there force it is ineuitable, for were they not ineuitable, then might eyther propernesse of person secure a man, or wisedome preuent am; or greatnesse exempt, or riches redeeme them, but present experience hath taught vs, that in this case, all these stand in no steade: for we see the properst men take part of them, the best wits cannot auoide them (for then should Poets be no cuckolds) nor can money redeeme them, for then would rich-men fine for their hornes, as they do for offices: But this is held for a maxime, that there are more rich cuckolds then poore, lastly for continuance of the horne it is vndeterminable till death: Neither doe they determine with the wiues death, (howsoeuer ignorant writers holde opinion they doe) For as when a knight dies, his Ladie still retaines the title of Ladie; when a company is cast yet the Captaine still retaines the title of Captaine; So though the wife die by whom this title came to her husband, yet by the curtesie of the City, he shalbe a cuckold during life, let all ignorant asses prate what they list. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
