        <head>PROLOGUE, By a FRIEND. </head>
        <l>I'th' latter Age, ere Criticks dar'd to Damn, </l>
        <l>Or Censure rashly, what deserv'd a Name; </l>
        <l>When Bully Ben lugg'd out in Cat'line's Cause, </l>
        <l>And huff'd his duller Audience to Applause, </l>
        <l>Then if the Poet swore 'twas good, each Guest </l>
        <l>Believ'd the Author, and approv'd the Feast: </l>
        <l>But now in humble Prologue, the poor Muse </l>
        <l>Implores your favour, and for mercy sues. </l>
        <l>To day the ty'rd Satyr takes his rest, </l>
        <l>And has at last himself a Fool confest: </l>
        <l>In vain is all his Malice, or his Art, </l>
        <l>He jerks, you grin, and damn him when you smart. </l>
        <l>This Ag's Crimes are past good Satyrs Cure, </l>
        <l>He scarce can lash you more than you'll endure. </l>
        <l>The busie States-man, can in a well-writ Scene </l>
        <l>See Treason punish'd, and yet Plots again: </l>
        <l>Young Gaming Heirs, who see poor Cully trickt, </l>
        <l>Laugh at the Jest, and the same Night are nickt. </l>
        <l>The London Cuckold sees his Brother Horn'd, </l>
        <l>Yet is not by the Stage-Example warn'd. </l>
        <l>The high kept Miss can see poor Jiltals fate, </l>
        <l>Yet Cuckolds her kind Keeper for a Treat: </l>
        <l>Since Headlong Folly then uncheck'd will reign, </l>
        <l>Successful Satyr but Rebels in vain▪ </l>
        <l>Our harmless Author therefore bid me say, </l>
        <l>That ev'n Fopp'ry goes untouch'd to day; </l>
        <l>There's scarce a knotted Fringe in all his Play. </l>
        <l>The stately Side-Box Beau may cock his Nose, </l>
        <l>And Mob'd up Phillis take a Morning Dose </l>
        <l>Of fifty Dishes at the Choc'late-House. </l>
        <l>And when the Consort's done, the Ladies may </l>
        <l>There entertain the Beaux till break of day, </l>
        <l>And still pretend they for their Coaches stay. </l>
        <l>Men of no bus'ness to the Court may come, </l>
        <l>And Essenc'd Wigs Perfume the Drawing Room; </l>
        <l>Where, on the Window, Fops, their Wit to prove, </l>
        <l>Write Petty-Treason to the God of Love. </l>
        <l>In short, whatever Crimes o'r run the Town, </l>
        <l>Here's none to day that are with Malice shown: </l>
        <l>We've Plot and Humour too, but as for Wit, </l>
        <l>Let that be judg'd by the discerning Pit. </l>

          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>IT has long been a Custom with Authors to trouble their best Friends; for, who but friends will excuse so many Impertinencies as are generally found in Dedications, and have their Names set as a Skreen betwixt our faults and the censures of the Criticks, who in this Age are so unmerciful, that they never spare the Poet for sake of the Patron, be he never so eminent or well qualify'd? </p>
        <p>A second pretence, is a grateful acknowledment of favours receiv'd; but there Self-Interest advances under the Mask of Gratitude and good Manners, for our thanks seem rather invitations to new Benefits. To say truth, Poets choose Patrons for their Plays, with the same design that crafty Parents do able Godfathers for their Children. </p>
        <p>The Reasons, Sir, why I shelter this under your Name, are, because your Affability, and singular good Disposition to all Mankind, enclines you not only to pardon Errors, but to confer Obligations, which you perform with that cheerfulness and courtesie, that whom you oblige you charm. Next, Sir, from the long acquaintance and vicinity of our Families and Relations, who ever held a fair and happy Correspondence till the vicissitudes of time gave Interruption. Then let this tender of my respects and service to you, with this small trifle, receive and establish me in your Memory and Friendship, which is the aim and ambition of, Sir, </p>
        <closer>
          <signed>Your sincere Friend, and most humble Servant, <hi>Edward Ravenscroft </hi>

I am told that in Marrying you, I may get as many Children as I think good; prepare therefore against to morrow, in order to the first; as for the rest, we'll think of them at leasure.

First, as to my Person, you see it well enough, there's nothing to be disliked; nature has been sufficiently bountiful to me, I am <hi>As strait as an Arrow; as plump as a Patridge;— and as sound as a Roach. </hi>But it may be said, I am of a full Age;— the better for you. <hi>Better be an Old Man's darling, than a Young Man's warling.

Now as I had a liking to you at first sight— So I know you must have some inclination in nature, to think well of me for a Husband. For I observe your Eye has been upon me e'er since I came— <hi>Looking breeds liking</hi>; and <hi>Where the Eye fixes, the Heart soon follows. </hi>So there's an end of that. Secondly, I am none of those that mind Fashions— <hi>Wisemen invent Fashions, and Fools follow 'em. </hi>I am rather for saving than spending, ever keeping in mind, that, <hi>To save is Healthful, to get is Comfortable, but to spend is Intolerable. </hi>Now my taking you for a Wife, shows what good Opinion I have of you, and that I believe you to be prudent enough, to imitate so reasonable a Husband; for without that and your Father's Three Thousand Pound, (which I would have with you) I shou'd never have Marryed you— nor can I doubt you hereafter, since <hi>A good Jack makes a good Jill. </hi>And from the moment I Marry you, I'll make you Mistress of all I am worth, (upon condition) you lay not any of it out, upon any occasion whatsoever. </p>
