        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>HE who comes hither with design to hiss, </l>
        <l>And with a bum revers'd, to whisper Miss, </l>
        <l>To comb a Perriwig, or to shew gay cloathes, </l>
        <l>Or to vent Antique non-sence with new oaths, </l>
        <l>Our Poet welcomes as the Muses friend; </l>
        <l>For hee'l by irony each Play commend. </l>
        <l>Next these we welcome such as briskly dine, </l>
        <l>At Locket's, at Gissord's, or with Shataline. </l>
        <l>Swell'd with Pottage, and the Burgundian Grape, </l>
        <l>They hither come to take a kindly nap. </l>
        <l>In these our Poet don't conceive much harm; </l>
        <l>For they pay well, and keep our benches warm. </l>
        <l>And though scarce half awake, some Playes they dam, </l>
        <l>They do't by Whole-sail; not by Ounce, and Dram. </l>
        <l>But when fierce Criticks get them in their clutch, </l>
        <l>They're crueller then the Tirannick Dutch. </l>
        <l>And with more Art, do dislocate each Scene, </l>
        <l>Then in Amboyna they the limbs of men. </l>
        <l>They wrack each line, and every word unknit, </l>
        <l>As if they'd find away to cramp all Wit. </l>
        <l>They are the terror of all adventurers here, </l>
        <l>The very objects of their hate and fear, </l>
        <l>And like rude Common-wealths they still are knit </l>
        <l>'Gainst English Plays, the Monarchyes of wit, </l>
        <l>They invade Poetique Lisence, and still rail </l>
        <l>At Plays, to which in duty they should vail. </l>
        <l>Yet still the' infest this Coast to fish for jests, </l>
        <l>To supplement their Wits at City feasts. </l>
        <l>Thus much for Criticks: to the more generous Wit, </l>
        <l>Our Poet Frankly, does each Scene submit; </l>
        <l>And begs your kind Allience to ingage </l>
        <l>Those Hogen interlopers of the Stage. </l>

        <l>OLd Plays, like Mistresses long since enjoy'd, </l>
        <l>Long after please whom they before had cloy'd; </l>
        <l>For Fancy chews the Cud on past Delight, </l>
        <l>And cheats it self to a new Appetiet. </l>
        <l>But then the Second Fit comes not so strong, </l>
        <l>Like second Agues, neither fierce nor long: </l>
        <l>What you have known before, grows sooner stale, </l>
        <l>And less provokes you, then an untold tale. </l>
        <l>That but refreshes what before you knew, </l>
        <l>But this discovers something that is new; </l>
        <l>Hence'tis, that at new Plays you come so soon, </l>
        <l>Like Bride-grooms, hot, to go to Bed e're noon! </l>
        <l>Or, if you are detain'd some little space, </l>
        <l>The stinking Footman's sent to keep your place. </l>
        <l>But, when a Play's reviv'd, you stay and dine, </l>
        <l>And drink till three, and then come dropping in; </l>
        <l>As Husband after absence, wait all day, </l>
        <l>And decently for Spouse till bed time stay, </l>
        <l>So, e're the Brethren's liberal fit was spent, </l>
        <l>The first wise Nonconformists under-went </l>
        <l>With ease, and batten'd in imprisonment. </l>
        <l>For greater gains, his zeal refus'd the less; </l>
        <l>Each day to him was worth a Diocess. </l>
        <l>But he who now, in hopes of equal gain, </l>
        <l>Will needs be Pris'ner, tryes the trick in vain; </l>
        <l>He melts in durance half his Grease away, </l>
        <l>To get, like us, poor thirteen Pounds a day. </l>
