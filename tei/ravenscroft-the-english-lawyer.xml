        <l>GAllants, pray what do you doe here to day? </l>
        <l>Which of you understands a Latine Play? </l>
        <l>This was a Cambridge piece, there first </l>
        <l>Brought forth, and by your <foreign xml:lang="lat">Alma Mater </foreign>nurst. </l>
        <l>For ought you know 'tis Latine still, at least </l>
        <l>Part must, in th' Lawyers Latine lay the jest. </l>
        <l>Perhaps of th' Vniversity you 've been, </l>
        <l>As by your Plate is in the Butteries seen; </l>
        <l>Tutors you had, and wore a daggl'd Gown, </l>
        <l>Rob'd Orchards for a year, then came to Town. </l>
        <l>This Age defies th' accomplishment of Schools, </l>
        <l>The Town breeds Wits, the Colledges make Fools. </l>
        <l>And tho' of Latine you retain some ends, </l>
        <l>'Tis so by Rote, that much I fear (my Friends) </l>
        <l>You scarce can construe <hi>Buscos &amp; Soccos </hi>
        </l>
        <l>Tiffanas &amp; Cambrica Smoccos. </l>
        <l>Scholars so scarce amongst you are, and few, </l>
        <l>Law-Latine will be Hebrew-Greek to you. </l>
        <l>To censure therefore do not you pretend, </l>
        <l>That which a Learned Age did so commend; </l>
        <l>We have you Coram-Nobis, and vouchamus, </l>
        <l>He that don't like it is an Ignoramus. </l>

In Holland, I carry'd about an Ape, in the habit of a Cardinal. Then I went to England, where I was first a Sow-gelder in the Countrey; afterwards, I was an under-Butler, or Wash-pot in the Inns of Court, among the Lawyers: For some misdemeanours I fled the Countrey, went to Geneva, where I got to be Vestry-man; not liking the Profession, I came running away with the Church-Bibles, the Childrens Psalters, Testaments and Catechises, which I sold to the Hugonots here. With the gain hereof and my Wives Portion, I set up this beggarly Profession of Pamphleteer. </p>

              <p>This Vtrada was a Merchant, who went upon the account of Traffick into England. One day as he was walking on the Shore at Deptford, where his Ship lay at Anchor, he fell in discourse with a young Nurse, whose Beauty much surpriz'd him. He entic'd her on board; she had in her arms a Child, which was your self: but you were no sooner there, but he clapt you both under hatches, and sail'd out of the River. He brought you to Mauritania, where he sold you and me, to Alphonso; who, having no Child, Adopted you for his Daughter, and chang'd your Name from Isabella, to Rosabella. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE Spoken by IGNORAMUS. </head>
        <p>HOld,&#8212; before the Court rise, I desire of my most honour'd Judges that sit upon the Benches, to be heard a word in favour of a Clyent. </p>
        <p>Here are the Executors of Peter-Poet defunct, Plaintiffs, and John-a-Stiles and <hi>John-a Nokes </hi>Criticks, Defendants. </p>
        <p>The Poynt is, Whether this Comedy having once received its Tryal, and come off clear, may be arraign'd a second time. </p>
        <p>I speak now for the Plaintiff, and I affirm, <hi>Que nemy</hi>, that it cannot. It had its Tryal in the last Age, before a whole Vniversity, the Learned Jury brought in their Verdict Not-guilty. It pass'd the censure of King James, and stands Authenticated by his Royal Approbation. Therefore it having Hic-ad-ante, heretofore been acquitted by its King and Countrey, as I find upon Record <foreign xml:lang="lat">decimo quarto Jacobi</foreign>, that it ought now to be held a good Liege-Play&#8212; But if you think to put us upon a New Tryal, we'll demurr to your Action and traverse your Proceedings. If you take away <pb xml:id="ep000694-037-b"/>its Good Name, there will be cause of Action against you, 'twill be <foreign xml:lang="lat">Scandalum Magnum</foreign>; nay, it will be petty Treason, 'twill be <foreign xml:lang="lat">Scandalum Magnatum</foreign>; for you call in question a Monarchs Approbation: Therefore, <hi>Cape curam</hi>, take care what you do; nor will an Appeal serve your turn, for from the Highest Power is no Appeal, from the Highest to the Lowest <foreign xml:lang="lat">Non datur Regressus</foreign>; Nay, we'll have you in <hi>Foro Conscientiae</hi>, we'll bring you into Chancery too, where you shall answer to Interrogatories <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sine fine</foreign>, without end; And the first shall be, Why you have no more wit than to betray your Ignorance, for <foreign xml:lang="lat">Ignoramus non habet inimicum nisi Ignorantem. </foreign>
        </p>
        <p>Now give me leave, as I am <hi>Ambidexter Ignoramus</hi>, and take Fees on both hands, to speak one two or three words in favour likewise of the Defendants, who left their Fees for me with my Clarks at the Office as they came in. </p>
        <p>I say then with Submission, and Permission, that the Criticks are all free Subjects, and to be debar'd of their Liberty is directly against <foreign xml:lang="lat">Magna Charta</foreign>, the very fundamental Laws of the Realm. Nay, with your favour we plead Prescription, we have had it so <foreign xml:lang="lat">Tempus ex mente</foreign>, time out of mind. The Wits are here Lords Paramount, and Poets but <hi>Tenants per Curtesie</hi>, therefore when you please sue out your Writ of Ejectment, and give 'em their Quietus: I say moreover, this place is your <hi>County Palatine</hi>, the Priviledges, Prerogatives and Royalties not to be infring'd, obstructed or abridged; here the Criticks may Arraign, <pb xml:id="ep000694-038-a"/>Adjudge and Condemn, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Nemine contradicente</foreign>; Hang, Draw and Quarter both Playes and Poets, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Cum Privilegio</foreign>. Therefore I say, that John-a-Stiles, and John-a-Noaks, and you the rest of my Clyents, that you may approve, dislike, applaud, discommend, condemn and damn <foreign xml:lang="lat">ad Libitum</foreign>, and that each of you is to have his free Vote at all Times, and of all Playes. As to all other Playes, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Causa patet</foreign>, 'tis without dispute. But whether it may be as to this particular Play, and in these Circumstances, there lyes the Quaere. Wherefore, in favour of all and every of my Clyents, as well Plaintiffs as Defendants, I conclude, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Consideratis considerandis</foreign>, that it may be Lawful, or it may not be Lawful; however, I say at all times, <hi>Curret Lex &amp; Vivat Rex</hi>. </p>
