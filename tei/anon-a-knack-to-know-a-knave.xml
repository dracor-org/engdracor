          <l>TIs strange to see how men of honestie, </l>

          <l>For they haue so many clokes to collour their abuses, </l>
          <l>That Honesty may well suspect them, but dares not detect them </l>
          <l>For if he should, they haue by their knauerie </l>
          <l>Got so many friends, that though neuer so bad, </l>
          <l>They will stand in defence with the best. </l>
          <l>I was at the water side, where I saw such deceit, </l>

          <l>Richer than I a great deale, but not honester: </l>
          <l>Then I went into che markers, where I saw petie knauerie: </l>
          <l>In false measuring corne, and in scales, </l>
          <l>That wanted no lesse than two ounces in the pound. </l>
          <l>But all this was nothing, scant worth the talking of: </l>
          <l>But when I came to the Exchange, I espyed in a corner of an Ile, </l>
          <l>An Arch-cosoner, a Conicatcher I meane. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
