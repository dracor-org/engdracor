Alas my friend what fortune calles thee foorth to seeke thy fortune among brasen gates, inchanted towers, fire and Brimstone, thunder and lightning. Beautie I tell thee is peerelesse, and she precious whom thou affectest: do off these desires good countriman, good friend runne away from thy selfe, and so soone as thou canst, forget her; whom none must inherit but he that can monsters tame, laboures atchiue, riddles absolue, loose inchantments, murther magicke, and kill coniuring: and that is the great and mighty Huanebango. </p>
