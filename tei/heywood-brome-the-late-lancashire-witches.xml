          <l>Has not reveal'd. Perhaps great Mercy may </l>
          <l>After just condemnation give them day </l>
          <l>Of longer life. We represent as much </l>
          <l>As they have done, before Lawes hand did touch </l>
          <l>Upon their guilt; But dare not hold it fit, </l>
          <l>That we for Iustices and Iudges sit. </l>
          <l>And personate their grave wisedomes on the Stage </l>
          <l>Whom we are bound to honour; No, the Age </l>
          <l>Allowes it not. Therefore unto the Lawes </l>
          <l>We can but bring the Witches and their cause, </l>
          <l>And there we leave'em, as their Divels did, </l>
          <l>Should we goe further with'em? Wit forbid; </l>

          <l>We must referre to time, our selves to you. </l>
