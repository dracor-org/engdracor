            <p>I Am quite weary of the Country Life; there is that Little thing the World calls Quiet, but there is nothing else; Clowns live and die in't, whose Souls lye hid here, and after Death their Names: My Kinder Stars, (I thank 'em) have Wing'd my Spirit with an Active Fire, which makes me wish to know what Men are Born for, to Dyet a Running Horse, to give a Hawk casting, to know Dogs Names; These make not Men; no, 'tis Philosophy, 'tis Learning, and Exercise of Reason to know what's Good and Virtuous, and to break our Stubborn and Untemper'd Wills, to Choose it; This makes us Imitate that Great Divinity that Fram'd us. </p>

            <p>My Father's Fondness has kept me so long in the Country, I've forgot all I'd Learn't at the University: Besides, take that at Best, it but Rough-casts us; No, London is the Choisest Academy, 'tis that must Polish us, and put a Gloss upon our Country-Studies; Hither I'm come at last, and do resolve to Glean many Vices. Thou, Tranio, hast been my Companion, still one Bed has held us, one Table fed us; and tho' our Bloods give me Precedency (that I count Chance) My Love has made us Equal, and I have found a frank return in thee. </p>
