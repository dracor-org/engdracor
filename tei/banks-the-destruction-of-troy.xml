        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY KATHERINE ROOS. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>SUch always has been the Iurisdiction, and so Supreme and Excellent the Authority of the <hi>Fair, Noble</hi>, and Virtuous, that Poets seem to be created for no other Purpose, but as anointed, to be the Voice of their Oracles, and to attend, and repeat 'em with as much Reverence as Priests do at the Altars of the Divinities they worship; to teach Mankind how to honour them when Living; and when Dead, to inlarge, and transmit their <hi>Noble <pb xml:id="ep000476-003-a"/>Actions </hi>to Posterity: And whilst the World lasts, this will be the most spatious and delightful. Theme, and will give the loftiest, and divinest Grace to Poetry; this made Homer sing, he that was blind, had ev'n that Inspiration; and BEAUTY from the Beginning has never faild to have more Adorers than the Gods: Nay it has still had such Power, that it has bin the Author of as strange Miracles; It has oft times made the Miser a Prodigal; the Old, Young; and the Coward, Valiant: what has it not done when joyn'd with VIRTUE? And what are You not able to inspire, in whom both excel; that Your Poet cou'd never be said to run on too lavish in Your Encomium? For Your Fame wou'd put a Blush upon all (as too mean) that can be said of You; and not accuse me of Flattery, if I cou'd describe You with as much Art as that rare Painter, who pictur'd his Venus with all the Smiles, and Graces of Woman-kind put together. How justly then have I heard the World admire at the infinite Happiness of Your LORD— But (pardon me, Madam) this is a Stream wou'd glide me insensibly away, and if I do not check my self, I shall like inspir'd Prophets, say Wonders not to be believ'd, in such a Style as our best Poets have fail'd in. Therefore as one that is more a <hi>Plain Dealer </hi>than a Courtier, I will leave my self severely to be censur'd by all that know You, for not revealing Your Ladiships Character as I ought, rather then put angry Blushes on your Cheeks by an unexpected Assault of so many rude Phrases: for Virtue so delicate, and tender as Yours, is sooner touch'd, and offended at the hearing of its just Praises, than at the Calumny of the Envious, and Detacters; and I protest to Your Ladiship, I had rather <pb xml:id="ep000476-003-b"/>owe my Bread to Charity, then be thought to earn it at so vile a Rate; only grant me leave to Sail a little into the Relation of the Iustness, and Gratitude of Your Ladiships Fortune. 'Tis known that You are descended from the most Noble House of the NOELS, and joyn'd to that Incomparable, and Princely Family of the MANNORS; but let me say, by such a Miracle, that never Day appear'd more beneficial to the benighted Travellour, then you o're its clouded Mansion, nor did the Rain-Bow (the Token of the Almighty in the Heavens, after the general Deluge by the Flood) to Noah's poor remaining Progeny shew it self more welcome, and propitious, than Your Ladiship to the despairing and almost distracted Family of the RUTLANDS, which after an unfortunate Marriage, when it had long wander'd upon the Face of barren Waters, You were at last discov'rd as a blest, and fruitful Land to rest its weary Ark upon, and it may for ever hereafter call. You its <hi>Good Angel </hi>that in its Flight from Heav'n first pitch'd upon the lofty, and most graceful Seat of Belvoire, whose Antiquity (which I hope may ever last) will pay you more Respect, and Adoration as to its Preserver, than it has done to its Founder: For by Your means, and your Illustrious Offspring, England shall never want a Branch that shall spread it self from so Noble an Original as Your kind LORD, nor be the least of its Glories that it can boast thereof. How much is to be admir'd the Wisdom of the Divine Power which made so Excellent a Choice as Your Ladiship, of whom it shall be said, that Atlas has not supported the Heav'ns with more Fame then Your Ladiship the tottering Greatness of Belvoire: And the History of Heroick Women shall henceforth <pb xml:id="ep000476-004-a"/>own you to be the Greatest, and Noblest Pattern of 'em all— Pardon me, Madam, I begin to fall into a Relaps. I wou'd not give the World an Occasion to suspect that what I have said is but the Prelude of a Request I intend to beg of your Ladiship, which is, that you wou'd vouchsafe to accept of this poor Poem, and be pleas'd to let me set your Name in the Front of it, as Princes put their Arms over the Dores of Places they wou'd have Reverenc'd, and Esteem'd. I will not then fear the Wise Criticks, nor the conceited Fops that are as curious in passing their Censures on a young Poet, as your stanch'd Beauties are to one that is newly cry'd up in the Town; yet I doubt not but what You please to condescend to own, they will allow of. I am the rather embolden'd to petition this of Your Ladiship, because You are an Incourager of POETRY, and I have been inform'd that not long since in the Person of the famous Earl of Rutland it has met with the most considerable Patron that ever was; and all know that your gallant Father, the present Vicount Cambden, is the best, and greatest Protector of Wit, and Learning in this Age. How can I fail then, in my Address to Your Ladiship, of either an Acknowledgment beyond my Desert, or at least a Pardon for my Faults, which I humbly implore you wou'd not deny, and is the greatest Favour that can be hop'd by, MADAM, </p>

        <lg>
          <l>SInce the Sun's kindly Beams have left us now, </l>
          <l>And in the other World make all things grow; </l>
          <l>Like Swallows to warm Seasons, we draw near, </l>
          <l>And hope to find a fruitful Summer here— </l>
          <l>May still our Orb so bright, and gay appear, </l>
          <l>And ev'ry Day adorn our Theatre— </l>
          <l>Wev'e nothing more to welcome you to Night, </l>
          <l>Than a plain, undrest Play, a homely Sight, </l>
          <l>No Shew to take your Eyes, that are more kind, </l>
          <l>And easier pleas'd than is the dainty mind. </l>
          <l>Language with you's esteem'd upon the Stage, </l>
          <l>Like some affected Gallants of this Age; </l>
          <l>Not for their Sence, but for their Equipage.— </l>
          <l>No, the rich Banquet is to come, a Treat </l>
          <l>Cook'd by your Chat'lin and La'Froon of Wit. </l>
          <l>This is a <hi>Christmas Tale </hi>has oft been told </l>
          <l>Over a Fire by Nurse, and Grandam old, </l>
          <l>Where they wou'd Paris the wild Youngster blame, </l>
          <l>For stealing Helen, that inconstant Dame. </l>
          <l>Yet we're in hopes you will be kind to hear </l>
          <l>The Lives of those whose Successours you are: </l>
          <l>For when Troy fell, its Remnant here did plant, </l>
          <l>And built this Place, and call'd it Troy-novant: </l>
          <l>But as those Venturers were forc'd to slay </l>
          <l>An Hoast of barb'rous Picts that stop'd their Way, </l>
          <l>First we're to withstand you Natives of the Bays, </l>
          <l>Who hate all new Invaders with new Plays, </l>
          <l>And therefore right, or wrong, damn whom you please. </l>
          <l>Then, that we may be stronger, we submit </l>
          <l>To all you <hi>London Trojans </hi>of the Pit, </l>
          <l>And all the merry Greeks, that seldom think, </l>
          <l>But only dive into good Wine, and Drink; </l>
          <l>Such may we often see, we'l soon defeat </l>
          <l>These Race of Picts that plague the Land of Wit.. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>THe Author is to beg your kindness now; </l>
          <l>He therefore chose me out the Task to do: </l>
          <l>For Women are best skill'd in wheadling you. </l>
          <l>He knows not yet how you have Censur'd him, </l>
          <l>Whether his Epilogue you will esteem, </l>
          <l>As a glad Flourish after Victory, </l>
          <l>Or the Swans Note, that sings when She's to die: </l>
          <l>But finding 'twas a Tax upon the Play, </l>
          <l>He rush'd on boldly, and thus bid me say,— </l>
          <l>To the fair Sex he first this Answer gives, </l>
          <l>If they shou'd chance to ask, why Helen lives? </l>
          <l>It was the truth, as History declares, </l>
          <l>(If there were any such as Trojan Wars,) </l>
          <l>If this fam'd Seige were no Bear-Garden Fray, </l>
          <l>And Ajax was no Butcher, as some say— </l>
          <l>Yet let her live, and find a far worse Doom, </l>
          <l>T'a Iealous Cuckold to be ty'd at home, </l>
          <l>Think how to Iilt, and never have the Pow'r, </l>
          <l>And that's a Curse that many of us indure.— </l>
          <l>Next, to the Men, if they're displeas'd, to find </l>
          <l>Her Husband, after all this Stir, so kind, </l>
          <l>We must confess that it is strange to see; </l>
          <l>Yet some of you have don't, more quietly; </l>
          <l>Not like th' Heroick Cuckold who for's Bride </l>
          <l>Has at the Bar as fierce a Combat try'd, </l>
          <l>As Hector, and Achilles ever did, </l>
          <l>Of which more fam'd Records are in the Hall, </l>
          <l>Than are of Troy, or <hi>Amadis de Gaule</hi>— </l>
          <l>As for the Men of Gallantry, and Wit, </l>
          <l>That love like Paris, and like Hector fight, </l>
          <l>They will not sure be sorry when they see </l>
          <l>This good Example for their Ease to be: </l>
          <l>For who among you's such a hungry Lover </l>
          <l>Wou'd after ten years eat the same Dish over. </l>
          <l>Next for Andromache, 'tis hard to find </l>
          <l>A Wife that is so constant, or so kind: </l>
          <l>We'ave no such foolish Widow in our Nation </l>
          <l>That will be taught by such a Scurvy Fashion; </l>
          <l>But soon as e're She can, think of betrothing </l>
          <l>Some proper, brawny Fellow that has nothing. </l>
