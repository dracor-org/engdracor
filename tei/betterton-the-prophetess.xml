In it are Four several Stages, representing the Pallaces of two Gods, and two Goddesses: The first is the Pallace of Flora; the Columns of red and white Marble, breaking through the Clouds; the Columns Fluted and Wreath'd about with all sorts of Flow'rage; the Pedestals <pb n="68" xml:id="ep000437-038-a"/>and Flutings inrich'd with Gold. The Second is, The Pallace of the Goddess Pomona, the Columns of blue Marble, wound about with all kind of Fruitage, and inrich'd with Gold as the other. The Third is, The Pallace of Bacchus, the Columns of green Marble, Wreath'd and Inrich'd with Gold, with Clusters of Grapes hanging round 'em. The last is the Pallace of the Sun; it is supported on either Side by Rows of Termes, the lower part white Marble, the upper part Gold. The whole Object is terminated with a glowing Cloud, on which is a Chair of State, all of Gold, the Sun breaking through the Cloud, and making a Glory about it: As this descends, there rises from under the Stage a pleasant Prospect of a Noble Garden, consisting of Fountains, and Orange Trees set in large Vases: the middle Walk leads to a Pallace at a great distance. At the same time Enters <hi>Silvanus, Bacchus, Flora, Pomona, Gods </hi>of the Rivers, <hi>Fawns, Nymphs, Hero's, Heroines, Shepherds, Shepherdesses, </hi>the Graces, and Pleasures, with the rest of their followers. The Dancers place themselves on every Stage in the Machine: the Singers range themselves about the Stage. </p>

          <l>We wisely sent for Irish to our aid; </l>
          <l>Who, would not swear we have the same pretence </l>

          <l>As hope our Stage, all others should exceed, </l>
          <l>And mingling with us, mend our English breed; </l>
