        <head>THE ARGVMENT. </head>
        <p>DARIVS, the fourteenth from Cyrus King of Persia, being after the death of Occhus for his singular valour from the gouernment of Armenia advanced to the Persian empyre, became so arrogant (Fortune, as it were, setting him forward to confusion) as he sent to demand tribute of Phillip, then King of Macedonia: who being of a hautie nature, and inferiour to none of that age in courage, or militarie discipline, requited this contumelius message with as disdainfull an answere; threatning that he would come and deliuer it in Persepolis. But being preuented by death he left the execution of his designe to his sonne Alexander, who for the great victories which thereafter he obtained was surnamed the great. He inheriting the hatred of his Father towards Darius, and far surmounting him in ambition, past in person to Asia with an armie of thirtie thousand only. </p>
        <p>After his arriuall, Darius wrote to him in a proud and contemptible manner, ascribing to himselfe the title of the King of Kings, and kinsman of the Gods, and naming Alexander his seruant. Hee also in vaunting manner boasted that he would haue that mad boy, the sonne Philip (for so in derision he tearmed him) bound, and beaten with rods, and after brought to his presence apparrelled like a Prince. For performance whereof he directed one of his Minions with fourtie thousand, to make impediment to his passage at the riuer of Granick; where by the wonderfull valour of Alexander <pb xml:id="ep000316-053-a"/>they were ouer-throwne. Darius being aduertised of this, came himselfe in proper person, accompanied with infinite, (but euill ordered) nombers; and encountred Alexander beside Isso, in the straites of Cilicia: where hauing fought a doubtfull and bloody battell, in ende by the invincible valour, and neuer-fayling Fortune of Alexander his armie was defeated, himselfe put to flight, and his mother, wife, and children made captiues. They were most courteouslie entertained by Alexander: who notwithstanding their exceeding great beautie yet would not abuse them, or suffer them to be abused by others: nor visited he them more oft then once (and that to comfort them) all the time of their imprisonment. </p>
        <p>Darius, notwithstanding of all his losses (his courage being in the full, whilst his Fortune was in the waine) wrote very proudly to Alexander, taking still the title of a King to himselfe, but not giuing it him, offering him as much gold, as Macedon could containe, for ransome of the Captiues. Which being very disdainfully refused by Alexander, he hauing re-enforced his troupes, &amp; comming forwarder to fight with greater force then before, was enformed how his wife had died in prison, whose death he bewaild with exceeding great sorrowe. And vnderstanding what courtesie Alexander had vsed towards her, he sent to sue for peace, not for any feare of his force, but allured (as he alledged) by his courtesie. This sute being likewise reiected, he fought beside Arbella with no better Fortune then before. Yet for all these misfortunes being of an inuincible courage, and dispayring of peace, he re-assembled all his forces, which were augmented by the comming of the Bactrians, &amp; was comming forward with intention at last either to die, or preuaile. But <pb xml:id="ep000316-053-b"/>in the meane time two traiterous subiects of his owne, to wit, Bessus whom he had promoted to be gouernour of Bactria, &amp; Nabarzanes one in speciall credite with him, conspired his death. Which danger, though it was reuealed to him by Patron, Captaine of the Greekes, yet he could not, or rather would not eschue. At length, those two traitours tooke and bound him with golden chaines, and cast him in an olde Chariot, with purpose to present him to Alexander. But they hearing how he would not accept their present, and how he was comming to inuade them, threw their darts at Darius, and left him for dead. In this estate he was found by Polistratus, and after the deliuery of some fewe words dyed. Alexander hauing exceedinglie lamented his miserable and vndeserued end, directed his bodie to his mother Sisigambis to be honourably buried. </p>
