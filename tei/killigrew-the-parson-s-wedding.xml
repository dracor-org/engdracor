            <p>No more, I'le sooner be reconcil'd to want, or sickness, then that Rascal; A thing, that my Charity made sociable; one, that when I smil'd would fawn upon me, and wag his stearn, like starved Dogs; so nasty, the Company cried foh upon him; He stunk so of Poverty, Ale, and Bawdry. So poor and despicable, when I relieved him, he could not avow his calling, for want of a Cassock, but stood at Corners of Streets, and whisper'd Gentlemen in the Ear, as they pass'd, and so deliver'd his Wants like a Message which being done, the Rogue vanished, and would dive at Westminster like a Dabchick, and rise again at Temple-gate; The ingenuity of the Rascal, his Wit being snuft by want, burnt cleer then, and furnish'd him with a bawdy Jest or two, to take the Company; But now the Rogue shall find he has lost a Patron. </p>

            <p>They say, you have a great power over the Parson; if you can prevail with him to express his anger in some Satyrick Comedy (for the knave has wit, and they say his genius lies that way,) tell him, 'tis expected he should be revenged upon the illiterate Courtier that made this Play; if you can bring this business about, I may find a way, as Epilogue, to be thankful, though the Captain abus'd you to day.

            <p>There's something of reason in what he says.— But my friend, how shall one believe you; you that were such a Rascal to day, in Buff, is it to be hoped you can be honest only with putting on a black cloak? well, I'll venture once again; and if I have any power, he shall sting the malicious Rascal; and I think he is fit for such a business. I'me sure he has the worst tongue; and a conscience that neither honour nor truth binds; and therefore 'tis to be believed, if he will rail in publick he may be even with your Poet; I will cloath and feed him and his Muse this seven years, but I will plague him: Secret tells me, 'twas your Poet too that pawn'd me, to day, in the Tavern. </p>
