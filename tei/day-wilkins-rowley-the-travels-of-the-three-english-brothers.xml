          <l>Charme your attentions in a gentle spell: </l>
          <l>Whilst our endeuors get a vocall tongue, </l>
          <l>To fill the pleasing roundure of your eares. </l>
          <l>Our Sceane is mantled in the robe of truth, </l>
          <l>Yet must we craue (by law of poesie) </l>
          <l>To giue our history an ornament. </l>
          <l>But equalling this definition, thus, </l>
          <l>Who giues a foule vnto his Cooke to dresse: </l>
          <l>Likewise expects to haue a foule againe, </l>

          <l>Much may be deminisht, som-what added, </l>
          <l>The losse of fethers and the gaine of fauce: </l>

          <l>It is (and may be truelie cald) the same: </l>
          <l>Such are our acts: should our tedious muse </l>
          <l>Pace the perticulers of our trauellers, </l>
          <l>Fiue daies would breake the limmits of our Sceanes </l>
          <l>But to expresse the shaddowes: therefore we, </l>
          <l>(Leauing the fethers and some needelesse stuffe) </l>
          <l>Present you with the fairest of our feast, </l>
          <l>Clothing our truth within an argument, </l>
          <l>Fitting the stage and your attention: </l>
          <l>Yet not so hid but that she may appeare, </l>
          <l>To be her selfe, euen truth: now your asists </l>
          <l>To helpe the entrance of our history: </l>
          <l>First see a father parting with his sonnes, </l>
          <l>Then in a moment, on the full failes of thought </l>
          <l>We will deuide them many hundred leagues, </l>
          <l>Our Sceane lies speechlesse, actiue, but yet dumbe: </l>
