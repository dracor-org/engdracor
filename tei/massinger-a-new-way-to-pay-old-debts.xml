          <l>And when they looke for freedome ran in score. </l>
          <l>It was a cruell courtesie to call </l>

          <l>You haue more wisely credited to such, </l>
          <l>That though they cannot pay, can value much. </l>
          <l>I am your debtor too, but to my shame </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
