        <head>TO THE Right Honourable HENRY Ld. Walgrave, BARON of CHEWTON, COMPTROLLER OF HIS Majesty's Houshold. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHen I consider'd that the design of my Authors in this Poem, was to shew transcendent Vertue, Piety and Constancy successful; I was <pb xml:id="ep000769-003-a"/>directed by Duty, as well as Inclination, to present it to your Lordship's Protection. The same pious Affections and Habits of Mind, were no less your Lordship's choice than Education. Nor is our Armusia more happy than your Lordship in a beauteous and royal Recompence, whose Perfections are but faintly shadowed in the Character of Quisara: No single merit obtain'd your Lordship so great a Blessing, but those universal Endowments and eminent Qualifications of Mind, by which you have charm'd the Affections of all good Men, and which will adorn your Lordship's Name as long as Learning, Piety and Loyalty, shall preserve a Reputation in the World. Amongst the present Ornaments of our Court, whose Accomplishments have rendred <pb xml:id="ep000769-003-b"/>them happy Objects of their Prince's Favour, your Lordship is allow'd to have no inferiour Claim. For as in the natural Body, our Animal Spirits are Supply'd by our most refin'd and vital Blood, such noble and ancient Families, as your Lordship's, are the proper Supplements to a declining Nobility. Many are your Advantages, both of Birth and Fortune. But not contented with descended Glories, your Lordship has imbellished those Honours with no less noble and acquir'd Endowments. To you, my Lord, our Foreign Ministers may resort, to inform themselves of the Manners and Languages of their own Courts. Your Lordship with the Experience and Prudence of Ulysses has seen both Men <pb xml:id="ep000769-004-a"/>and Countries, from which you have inrich'd your self with all that was good, and left all their Vices and Vanities behind. But these, my Lord, your excellent Qualifications are fitter to adorn our Annals, than a private Dedication. All my present Ambition is to beg your Lordship's favourable Censure on this following Essay. It had been Presumptuous in me without some Obligation (which I could not well de cline) to attempt an Alteration in any Composure of Beaumont and Fletcher. Those Defects in Manners, that were too palpable through the Work, must be imputed to the Age in which they Wrote; but still there are so many and transcending Beauties in all their Writings, that I iudg'd it safest <pb xml:id="ep000769-004-b"/>to Rob their Treasure for a Tribute to your Lordship. The Metal is still the same, but whether it has gain'd or lost by the new Stamp, must be submitted to your Lordship, by him, that is only Ambitious to be allow'd </p>
