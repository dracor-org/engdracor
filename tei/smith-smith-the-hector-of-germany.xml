        <p>Poesie is a diuine gifte, borne with many, without which donation no man can be a Poet, though he be Princeps doctorum; and haue all the Languages (ad vnguem.) Ouid found this inclination in himselfe, and that was the reason hee saide, Quicquid conabor dicere versus erit; where Nature speakes so forceablie in any, there is no suppressing it: For, Naturam expellas furca licet vsque recurrit, your Wor: is so farre from offering such violence, that you are known to be a great cherisher of the Muses. And I hauing receiued some fauours from you, for priuate things, thought it might be acceptable, to giue you some Honor in Print; So that this Play, intuled The Palsgraue, beeing made for Citizens, who acted it well; I deemde it fitte to bee Patronizde by a Citizen. And not knowing any so worthy thereof as your selfe, I made choyce of your Wor: to be my Mecoenas: The kinde acceptance whereof, will make me proceede farther in your praise. And as I haue begun in a former Play, called the Freemans Honour, acted by the Now-seruants of the Kings Maiestie, to degnifie the worthy Companie of the Marchantaylors, wherof you are a principall Ornament, I shall ere long, make choyce of some subiect to equall it.

        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <l>OUr Authour for himselfe, this bad me say, </l>
        <l>Although the Palsgraue be the name of th' Play, </l>
        <l>Tis not that Prince, which in this Kingdome late, </l>
        <l>Marryed the Mayden-glory of our state: </l>
        <l>What Pen dares be so bold in this strict age, </l>
        <l>To bring him while he liues vpon the Stage? </l>
        <l>And though he would, Authorities sterne brow </l>
        <l>Such a presumptuous deede will not allow: </l>
        <l>And he must not offend Authoritie, </l>
        <l>Tis of a Palsgraue generous and high, </l>
        <l>Of an vndaunted heart, an Hectors spirit, </l>
        <l>For his great valour, worthy royall merite; </l>
        <l>Whose fayre achieuements, and victorious glory, </l>
        <l>Is the mayne subiect of our warlike Story. </l>
        <l>Mars gouerns here, his influence rules the day, </l>
        <l>And should by right be Prologue to the Play: </l>
        <l>But that besides the subiect, Mercury </l>
        <l>Sent me to excuse our insufficiencie. </l>
        <l>If you should aske vs, being men of Trade, </l>
        <l>Wherefore the Players facultie we inuade? </l>
        <l>Our answere is, No ambition to compare </l>

        <l>Nor with a thought for any grace you giue </l>
        <l>To our weake action, by their course to liue: </l>
        <l>But as in Camps, and Nurseries of Art, </l>
        <l>Learning and valour haue assum'd a part, </l>
        <l>In a Cathurnall Sceane their wits to try, </l>
        <l>Such is our purpose in this History. </l>
        <l>Emperours haue playd, and their Associates to, </l>
        <l>Souldiers and Schollers; tis to speake and do. </l>
        <l>If Citizens come short of their high fame, </l>
        <l>Let Citizens beare with vs for the name. </l>
        <l>And Gentlemen, we hope what is well ment, </l>
