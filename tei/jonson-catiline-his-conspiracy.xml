        <p>IN so thick, and darke an ignorance, as now almost couers the age, I craue leaue to stand neare your light: and, by that, to bee read. Posteritie may pay your benefit the honor, &amp; thanks: when it shall know, that you dare, in these Iig-giuen times, to countenance a legitimate Poeme. I must call it so, against all noise of opinion: from whose crude, and ayrie reports, I appeale, to that great and singular faculty of iudgement in your Lordship, able to vindicate truth from error. It is the first (of this race) that euer I dedicated to any person, and had I not thought it the best, it should haue beene taught a lesse ambition. Now, it approcheth your censure cheerefully, and with the same assurance, that innocency would appeare before a magistrate. </p>

          <l>How haue we chang'd, and come about </l>
          <l>In euery doome, </l>
          <l>Since wicked CATILINE went out, </l>
          <l>And quitted Rome? </l>
          <l>One while, we thought him innocent; </l>
          <l>And, then, w' accus'd </l>
          <l>The Consul, for his malice spent; </l>
          <l>And power abus'd. </l>
          <l>Since, that we heare, he is in armes, </l>
          <l>We thinke not so: </l>
          <l>Yet charge the Consul, with our harmes, </l>
          <l>That let him goe. </l>
          <l>So, in our censure of the state, </l>
          <l>We still doe wander; </l>
          <l>And make the carefull magistrate </l>
          <l>The marke of slander. </l>
          <l>What age is this, where honest men, </l>
          <l>Plac'd at the helme, </l>
          <l>A sea of some foule mouth, or pen, </l>
          <l>Shall ouer-whelme? </l>
          <l>And call their diligence, deceipt; </l>
          <l>Their vertue, vice; </l>
          <l>Their watchfulnesse, but lying in wait; </l>
          <l>And bloud, the price. </l>

            <l>Against such men, as onely by their crimes </l>
            <l>Are knowne; thrust out by riot, want, or rashnesse. </l>
            <l>One sort, SYLLA's old troops, left here in Fesula, </l>

            <l>Growne needy, and poore: and haue but left t'expect, </l>
            <l>From CATILINE, new bills, and new proscriptions. </l>
            <l>These men (they say) are valiant; yet, I thinke 'hem </l>
            <l>Not worth your pause: For either their old vertue </l>

            <l>In great affaires, and doubtfull, it behooues </l>
            <l>Men, that are ask'd their sentence, to be free </l>
            <l>From either hate, or loue, anger, or pittie: </l>
            <l>For, where the least of these doe hinder, there </l>
            <l>The mind not easily discernes the truth. </l>
            <l>I speake this to you, in the name of Rome, </l>
            <l>For whom you stand; and to the present cause: </l>
            <l>That this foule fact of LENTVLVS, and the rest, </l>
            <l>Weigh not more with you, then your dignitie; </l>
            <l>And you be more indulgent to your passion, </l>
            <l>Then to your honor. If there could be found </l>
            <l>A paine, or punishment, equall to their crimes, </l>
            <l>I would deuise, and helpe: but, if the greatnesse </l>
            <l>Of what they ha' done, exceed all mans inuention, </l>
            <l>I thinke it fit, to stay, where our lawes doe. </l>
            <l>Poore pettie states may alter, vpon humour, </l>
            <l>Where, if they offend with anger, few doe know it, </l>
            <l>Because they are obscure; their fame, and fortune </l>
            <l>Is equall, and the same. But they, that are </l>
            <l>Head of the world, and liue in that seene height, </l>
            <l>All mankind knowes their actions. So wee see, </l>
            <l>The greater fortune hath the lesser licence. </l>
            <l>They must nor fauour, hate, and least be angrie: </l>
            <l>For what with others is call'd anger, there, </l>
            <l>Is crueltie, and pride. I know SYLLANVS, </l>
            <l>Who spoke before me, a iust, valiant man, </l>
            <l>A louer of the state, and one that would not, </l>
            <l>In such a businesse, vse or grace, or hatred; </l>
            <l>I know, too, well, his manners, and modestie: </l>
            <l>Nor doe I thinke his sentence cruell (for </l>

            <l>Since to a citizen of Rome, offending, </l>

            <l>When, by the diligence of so worthy a Consul, </l>
