          <p>These signs are the Language of Nature, by which she declares her wants.

          <p>Stay Sir, and let me tell you in short, That I was no sooner return'd from the field, but I was inform'd by the Servant of Elvira, that her Mistress was gone to a Friends House, and had given her order to bring me to her with all speed, where she had an opportunity to discourse with me, which the presence of <hi>Don Ruis </hi>allow'd her not at home. I went: was conducted in a back way at a private door: was had up into a fair apartment, where I was received only by the fair Elvira, her first words demanded if I were resolv'd to fight with you. I replied we had already been in the field, and that you was no longer my enemy or her Brothers. Those doubtful words deceiv'd the understanding of one that hearken'd, for then a Lady bolted out of an inner Room, eagerly demanding if you was kill'd! Her passionate enquiries forc'd from me a speedy relation of what had pass'd in the field, which scarce was ended when news was brought that her Father was come in; that he had lock'd the back door, which was left open for my retreat; to avoid his presence, I retired into an inner Room, but he no sooner enter'd, but Elvira took her leave to be gone, he offer'd her his service home, which she accepted to give me an opportunity to get out of the house. They were no sooner gone, but your coming up occasioned a second surprise. I again made my retreat to the same place. What follow'd I need not tell you. Now <hi>Don Diego </hi>do you think, you and I have any occasion to go into the Field. </p>

        <l>OUr Play's success we very much do fear, </l>
        <l>For we see few, but Wits and Criticks here&#9642; </l>
        <l>We are sure of you at all times of th' year. </l>
        <l>Our Londoners are gone for recreation </l>
        <l>To spend with Country friends the long vacation; </l>
        <l>Or else to Epsome for a moneth's purgation. </l>
        <l>The Country gallants too, whom suits of Law, </l>
        <l>And Four Cart-horses up to Town did draw </l>
        <l>In mouldy Couch, fill'd with their she relations, </l>
        <l>Who once a year come up to see the fashions; </l>
        <l>When each had bought her a new tawdry Gown, </l>
        <l>The Law Suits ended and the terms were done. </l>
        <l>They and their Sun burnt Squires hasten'd down. </l>
        <l>How we rejoc'd to see 'em in our pit! </l>
        <l>What difference, me thoughts there was, </l>
        <l>Betwixt a Country Gallant and a Wit. </l>
        <l>When you did order Perriwig with Comb, </l>
        <l>They only us'd four fingers and a Thumb. </l>
        <l>Whil'st you stroak'd up fring'd gloves were elbow deep, </l>
        <l>They one glove on, the other off did keep, </l>
        <l>Thus twist and twist, and the tand calve-skin gripe, </l>
        <l>Till it look'd like a Chitterlin or Tripe; </l>
        <l>And then to stretch it, thus thro' hand they'd pull it. </l>
        <l>But Lord! the wisp'd Cravat that hung below the gullet! </l>
        <l>How pale and white did your complexions shew </l>
        <l>To their Mary-Gold-Faces, as they sat by you! </l>
        <l>But when betwixt the acts they did stand up, </l>
        <l>Their swords look'd as if they belong to th'County troop&#9642; </l>
        <l>Huge ones they wore in narrow girdle Belts. </l>
        <l>But most I laugh'd to see their flapping Felts. </l>
        <l>They in their greasie waste Belts and great Swords, </l>
        <l>Like Yeomen look'd, but, you like any Lords. </l>
        <l>You had large shoulder Belts with Riband ty'd, </l>
        <l>And each a little little spit-frog by his side. </l>
        <l>Well as you please you may laugh on and jeer, </l>
        <l>But such as these all your Forefathers were. </l>
        <l>Tho they perha&#9679;&#9679;&#9679;n't so much Wit as you, </l>
        <l>They've more &#12296;&#8230;&#12297; and more Money too; </l>
        <l>But there the &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; does them out do. </l>
        <l>Wherefore your Company our stage renounces, </l>
