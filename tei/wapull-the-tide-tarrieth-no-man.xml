        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>AS the worme which in the timber is bred, </l>
          <l>The selfe same timber doth consume and eate: </l>
          <l>And as the moth which is commonly fed, </l>
          <l>In the cloth with her bred, and the same doth frete. </l>
          <l>So many persons are a damage great, </l>
          <l>To their own countrey, which hath them relieued, </l>
          <l>And by them their own countrey ofte times is gréeued. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ So many citties and townes are defamed, </l>
          <l>By reason that some inhabitauntes is ill: </l>
          <l>So that for ones facte, the whole towne is blamed, </l>
          <l>Although the residue to good doe their will. </l>
          <l>Yet the fact of this one, the others good name doth spill, </l>
          <l>And thus a reproch to his own towne ingendreth, </l>
          <l>And the good name of the whole town he hindereth. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ To what ende these wordes we haue spoken, </l>
          <l>In our matter shalbe more playnely exprest, </l>
          <l>Which the Tide tarieth no man, to name hath token, </l>
          <l>For that it is moste agréeable and best. </l>
          <l>Because that no man from his pleasure will rest, </l>
          <l>But ech man doth take the time of his gayne, </l>
          <l>Although the same be to others great payne. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ For so gréedy is the person auaricious, </l>
          <l>Whome Saint Austen doth well liken to hell, </l>
          <l>For that they both are so much insacious, </l>
          <l>That neyther of them know when they are well. </l>
          <l>And Ambrosius doth verify and tell, </l>
          <l>How that couetous persons do lack that they haue, </l>
          <l>And therefore not satisfyed till they are in graue. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ But where such people are, small loue there doth rest, </l>
          <l>But gréedy desyre supplieth the place: </l>
          <l>The symple ones commonly, by such are opprest, </l>
          <l>For they nothing way, any néedy mans case. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000301-004-a"/>
          <l>But with gréedy grype, their gayne they imbrace, </l>
          <l>No kind of degrée that they will forbeare, </l>
          <l>Neyther any time they will let slip or spare. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ And although that here a Courtyer is named, </l>
          <l>Yet thereby is not ment the Courtyer alone: </l>
          <l>But all kindes of persons, who their suites haue framed, </l>
          <l>Or to any such gréedy guttes, haue made their mone. </l>
          <l>Being driuen to their shiftes, to haue ought by lone, </l>
          <l>How gréedinesse at such times, doth get what he can, </l>
          <l>And therefore still cryeth, Tyde tarieth no man. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ Which prouerbe right well might be applyed, </l>
          <l>To a better sence then it is vsed: </l>
          <l>There is time to aske grace, this may not be denyed, </l>
          <l>Of thy sinfull life so greatly abused. </l>
          <l>Let not that time then be refused, </l>
          <l>For that tyde most certayne will tarry no man, </l>
          <l>Thus taking the prouerbe, we rightly do scan. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>¶ Thus worshipfull Audyence, our Authour desyreth, </l>
          <l>That this his acte you will not depraue: </l>
          <l>But if any fault be, he humbly requireth, </l>
          <l>That due intelligence thereof he may haue, </l>
          <l>Committing himselfe to your discretions graue, </l>
          <l>And thus his Prologue he rudely doth end, </l>
          <l>For at hand to approche, the Players intend. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
