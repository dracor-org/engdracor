        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY, EARL of Norwich, and EARL-Marshal of ENGLAND, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THe Impudence of Scriblers in this Age, has so corrupted the Original Designe of Dedications, that before I dare tell you, this trifle begs your Lordships Protection, I ought first to Examine on what grounds I make the Attacque; for now every thing that e're saw the Stage, how modest soever it has been there, without daring to shew ' its Face above three Dayes, has yet the Arrogance to thrust it self into the World in Print with a Great Name before it: Where the fawning Scribler shall compendiously say, the factions of Critiques, the Ill time of the Year, and the worse Acting of the Players, has prejudiced his Play, but he doubts not but his Grace, or his Honour's more impartial Judgment will find that pardonable which the World has so Maliciously Censur'd; that is as much as to say: Sir, You are the only Person at Court whose blind side I dare venture on, not doubting but your good Nature will excuse what all the World (except the Author) has justly condemned. Thus they esteem their Plays, as the Fanaticks do their Religion, the better for suffering Persecution; and to disguise their Shame, and prop their Feeble Writings, they make Dedications when their Playes are Damn'd, as the Dutch do Bonefires, when their Navies are beaten; be their Success never so bad, they still write themselves Conquerors: And thus a Dedication which was formerly a Present to a Person of Quality, is now made a Libel on him, whilst the Poet either supposes his Patron to be so great a Sot, to defend that in Print, which he hist off the Stage: Or else makes himself a greater, <pb xml:id="ep000712-003-a"/>in asking a Favour from him which he ne're expects to obtain. However, that which is an abuse to the Patron, is a Complement to the Bookseller, who whispers the Poet, and tells him, Sir, Your Play had misfortune, and all that— but if you'd but write a Dedication, or Preface— The Poet takes the hint, picks out a person of Honour, tell him he has a great deal of Wit, gives us an account who writ sense in the last Age, supposing we cannot be Ignorant who writes it in This; Disputes the nature of Verse, Answers a Cavil or two, Quibles upon the Court, Huffs the Critiques, and the work's done. 'Tis not to be imagin'd how far a Sheet of this goes to make a Book-seller Rich, and a Poet Famous. </p>
        <p>But my Lord, whilst I trouble you with this kind of discourse, I beg you would not think I design to give Rules to the Press, as some of our Tribe have done to the Stage; or that I find fault with their Dedications in Complement to my own: No, that's a trick I do not pretend to. Besides your particular Favours, in the publick Honours you have condescended to grant this Play, and the Author, have heightned my sense of Gratitude beyond my Power of expressing it. This Play, which for no other Merit▪ 〈◊〉 take Sanctuary here, throws it self at your feet, as your own: the Story of which, I owe to your Hands, and your honourable Embassy into Africa: And on that score I present it to your Patronage, as the Jews made their Sacrifices which we read took fire from Heaven: The Incense was lighted by that Divinity to whom it was offer'd; nor is this all I may modestly boast of: For besides it's noble Birth, you gave it a noble Education, when you bred it up amongst Princes, presenting it in a Court-Theatre, and by persons of such Birth and Honour, that they borrow'd no Greatness from the Characters they acted. Thus has your Lordship shew'd your self so great a Friend to the Muses; that as in former ages the Poet made the Patron: When all that's left of a Maecenas, is, that Horace gave him a Name: Your influence on the Contrary makes the Poet, and if this Play Live, or have Success enough to preserve a Name; 'tis by being your Creature, and enjoying your Smiles; which is the highest Ambition of </p>

          <lg>
            <l>I Wish you only did expect to day, </l>
            <l>A common Prologue to some usual Play. </l>
            <l>For when young Ladies are to speak to Kings, </l>
            <l>You look that they should say no Vulgar things. </l>
            <l>'Tis below us what meaner Actors do: </l>
            <l>Either t' excuse our selves, or rail at You. </l>
            <l>Nor come you here as to the Common Pit, </l>
            <l>With the lest hope of finding fault with Wit. </l>
            <l>Loves gentler Thoughts possess the Men of Sense: </l>
            <l>At lest it shall be so, e're they go hence. </l>
            <l>Gallants take warning then: 'ttime to fear; </l>
            <l>When Youth and Beauties on the Stage appear. </l>
            <l>Those Charms else-where are pretty dangerous found: </l>
            <l>But here we shoot upon a Rising Ground. </l>
            <l>No Heart can scape we have a mind to hit, </l>
            <l>Unless 'tis guarded by some Eyes 'ith Pit. </l>
            <l>To Hearts engag'd our power does not extend: </l>
            <l>And therefore, Sir, to you we humbly bend. <stage xml:id="ep000712-e930">To the King. </stage>

            <l>Yet from your Constancy we need not fear: </l>

            <l>No watching Eyes, those soft alluring Wiles, </l>
            <l>Can hinder you from giving Gracious Smiles. </l>
            <l>Now for the Men: Their praise should next be shewn; </l>

            <l>WIT has of late took up a Trick t'appear, </l>
            <l>Unmannerly, or at the best severe. </l>
            <l>And Poets share the Fate by which we fall, </l>
            <l>When kindly we attempt to please you all. </l>
            <l>'Tis hard, your scorn should against such prevail, </l>
            <l>Whose ends are to divert you, tho' they fail. </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000712-004-a"/>
            <l>You Men would think it an ilnatur'd Jest, </l>

            <l>Then rail not here, though you see reason for't. </l>
            <l>If Wit can find it self no better sport; </l>
            <l>Wit is a very foolish thing at Court. </l>
            <l>Wit's bus'ness is to please, and not to fright, </l>
            <l>'Tis no Wit to be always in the right: </l>
            <l>You'l find it none, who dare be so to night. </l>
            <l>Few so ill-bred will venture to a Play, </l>
            <l>To spy out Faults in what we Women say. </l>
            <l>For us no matter what we speak, but how: </l>
            <l>How kindly can we say— I hate you now. </l>
            <l>And for the men, if you'l laugh at e'm, do; </l>
            <l>They mind themselves so much, they'l ne're mind you.— </l>
            <l>But why do I descend to lose a Prayer </l>
            <l>On those small Saints in Wit, the God sits there. </l>
            <l>To you (Great Sir) my Message hither tends, </l>
            <l>From Youth and Beauty your Allies and Friends. </l>
            <l>See my Credentials written in my Face, </l>
            <l>They challenge your Protection in this place: </l>
            <l>And hither come with such a Force of Charms, </l>
            <l>As may give check even to your prosp'rous Armes: </l>
            <l>Millions of Cupids hovering in the Rear, </l>
            <l>Like Eagles following fatal Troops, appear. </l>
            <l>All waiting for the slaughter, which draws nigh, </l>
            <l>Of those bold Gazers, who this Night must dye. </l>
            <l>Nor can you 'scape our soft Captivitie, </l>
            <l>From which old Age alone must set you free. </l>
            <l>Then tremble at the fatal Consequence— </l>
            <l>Since, 'tis well known for your own part (Great Prince) </l>
            <l>'Gainst us you still have made a weak Defence.— </l>
            <l>Be generous, and wise, and take our part; </l>
            <l>Remember we have Eyes, and you a Heart. </l>
            <l>Else you may find, too late, that we are things </l>
            <l>Born to kill Vassals, and to conquer Kings, </l>
            <l>But oh! to what vain Conquest I pretend, </l>
            <l>Whil'st Love is our Commander, and your Friend. </l>
            <l>Our Victory your Empire more assures, </l>
