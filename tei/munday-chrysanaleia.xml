        <head>Chrysanaleia: THE GOLDEN FISHING. </head>
        <head type="sub">Or, Honour of Fishmongers. </head>
        <p>I Finde it faithfully recorded in Authors of reuerend Antiquity, that when Godfrey, Duke of Boloigne (beeing chosen Generall of the Christian Army, for the freedome and deliuerance of Ierusalem from Saladine, and al his other heathen miscreants;) Euery Christian Kingdome did ayde him with their best assistance: because it was a businesse to Gods high honour, and generall comfort of poore distressed Christians. As from all other Kingdomes, so from England (among other bands of worthy men) went the Merchants (trading in fish, oyle, flaxe, silkes and other commodities) most frequently then termed Fishmongers, and the Goldsmithes, then in a late begun league of loue and amity, by many friendly helpes and furtherances each to other, in diuers dangerous aduentures, as well on the Seas, as the land, no men being more forward in those affaires, and in those times then they. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000796-004-a"/>
        <p>After the most glorious victory obtained against the Pagans, &amp; Ierusalem regained, they ioined together in as glorious an action, of helping to build the ruined Wall againe, from the Water-gate of comfort, to the Sheepe-gate of innocencie, or holinesse. And so much the rather, because there was then much necessity of their paines and endeuour, not only (by Fishing and Shipping) to supply the daily wants of the Souldiours: but also for bringing Gold and Siluer thither, for beautifying Gods City and Temple. </p>
        <p>And as this league of loue and fellowship began vpon so good an occasion: So they continued, and declared it in Englands Ierusalem, our famous Metropolis London, building the Wall and two North Gates therein, Moore-gate, and Criples-gate, as yet their Armes and Memories on them do sufficiently testifie. The one performed by <hi>Thomas Faulconer, Fishmonger</hi>, and the other by <hi>William Shaw Goldsmith</hi>. </p>
        <p>Moreouer, Fish and Oyle, as well as Golde, Spices, Silkes, &amp;c. were first brought in by those forenamed Merchants: That the golden Lampe might not want holy and precious oyle, nor rich and orient Pearles (first found in shelles by painfull and industrious Fishermen) faile to be set in Iewels &amp; Rings of Gold, as beeing the purest mettall that the earth can affoord. And hereupon, honourable Antiquity thought meete, to bestow such armory on them, as (for euer) might continue their brotherly affection. First, Peters keies, he being called from the condition of a poore Fisherman, to be the prime Apostle: <pb xml:id="ep000796-004-b"/>and those supposed keyes, the Fishmongers beare in their Ensignes of Armes, not superstitiously any way, but to declare an earnest zeale, of entring into heauens Kingdome. Next, Dauids Cup of sauing health, which the Gold-Smiths also beare in their Banners. So much briefly, in approuing their long continued loue and amity. </p>
        <div type="part" xml:id="ep000796-e360">
          <head>The Reason of our present Shewe. </head>
          <p>TIme hauing turned his yearely Glasse, for election of a Magistrate, a Brother of the Fishmougers Societie, comming (by right of place, and general Sufferages of the Citizens) to the high dignitie of Lord Maior of this Citie for the yeere ensuing: our deuices for that solemne and Iouiall day, were and are accordingly proportioned, by the discreete and well aduised iudgement of the Gentlemen, thereto chosen and deputed, in manner and forme as followeth. </p>
          <p>First therefore, because Fishing is the absolute Embleme of our present intendement, and Fishmongers, hauing beene such worthy Merchants in those reuerend and authentique times: leauing their matter of Commerce and Merchandise, and ayming at their true Hierogliphical impresse for the dayes intended honour, thus we marshall the order of proceeding. </p>
          <p>Our first deuice that vshers and leades the way, is a very goodly and beautifull fishing Busse, called; the <hi>Fishmongers Esperanza</hi>, or Hope of London: being in her true old shape, forme and proportion, yet <pb xml:id="ep000796-005-a"/>dispensed withall in some beautie, for the dayes honour. It may passe (by generall sufferance) for the same fishing Busse, wherein S. Peter sate mending his Nets, when his best Master called him from that humble and lowly condition, and made him a Fisher of men. If not so; take her for one of those fishing Busses, which not only enricheth our kingdome with all variety of fish the Sea can yeelde: but helpeth also (in that kind) all other lands. Fishermen, in this fishing Busse are seriously at labour, drawing vp their Nets, laden with liuing fish, and bestowing them bountifully among the people. </p>
          <p>Next followeth a crowned Dolphin, alluding som way to the Lord Maiors coate of Armes, but more properly to the Companies, and therefore may serue indifferently for both. But because it is a Fish inclined much (by nature) to Musique: Arion, a famous Musicion and Poet, rideth on his backe, being saued so from death, when Robbers and Pirates on the Seas, would maliciously haue drowned him. </p>
          <p>Then commeth the King of Moores, gallantly mounted on a golden Leopard, he hurling gold and siluer euery way about him. Before, on either side, and behinde him, ride fixe other his tributarie Kings on horse-backe, gorgeously attired in faire guilt Armours, and apt furniutre thereto belonging. They carry Ingots of golde and siluer, and each one his dart, and in this order they attend on him: shewing thereby, that the Fishmongers are not vnmindfull of their combined brethren, the worthy Company of Golde-Smithes, in this solemne day of triumph. </p>
          <pb xml:id="ep000796-005-b"/>
          <p>We next present a singular Embleme, corresponding with the Creast and Cognizance of the Lord Maior, and bearing an especiall Morality beside. A <hi>Leman tree</hi>, in full and ample forme, richly laden with the fruite and flowers it beareth. Neere to the stocke or roote thereof, a goodly Pellicane hath built her nest, with all her tender brood about her. And because her loue and care (according to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle, Plinie, Gesner</hi>, and diuers other good writers) makes her extraordinarily iealous of them, as neuer daring to be absent from them (the sustenance she receiueth from the male Bird, being insufficient for their nourishing:) with her beake she launceth her brest, and so supplieth that want with her owne bloud. Our cited Authors variously affirme, that this loue and cherishing of them lasteth the space of a whole yeare, by which time, they become strong, and able for flight; and then, though they suruiue, the Damme dyeth. An excellent type of gouernment in a Magistrate, who, at his meere entrance into his yeares Office, becommeth a nursing father of the Family: which, though hee bred not, yet, by his best endeuour, hee must labour to bring vp. </p>
          <p>If his loue and delight be such to the Common-wealth, as that of the Pellican to her young ones, by broken sleeps, daily and nightly cares, that the very lest harm should not happen to his charge: then doth he iustly answere to our Embleme; and, as of her, so of him, it may well be sayd, his brest and bowels of true zeale and affection, are alwaies open, to feed and cherish them (euen with his best endeuor and <pb xml:id="ep000796-006-a"/>diligence) to the expiration of his yeare. And then, though the maine Authoritie of Gouernement (in him) may be sayd to dye: yet it suruiueth in other Pellicans of the same brood, and so it reacheth to them in the same manner. And because the <hi>Leman Tree </hi>(by the affirmation of <hi>Iulius Solinus Polyhistor, Dioscorides, Pomponius Mela, Petrus Mexius </hi>and <hi>Antonius Verdierus</hi>) both in fruite, flowers, rinde, pith, and iuyce, are admirable preseruers of the sences in man, restoring, comforting and relieuing any the least decay in them: wee seated the fiue Sences about the Tree, in their best and liueliest representations, as fitly iumping with our Morall methode. </p>
          <p>Our next deuice, before it be marshalled in due ranke and order, is a goodly Bower, shaped in forme of a flowrie Arbour, and adorned with all the Scutchions of Armes of so many worthy men, as haue beene Lord Maiors of the Fishmongers Company, and each mans name truely set downe on them. It is appointed first to stand in Paules Church-yard: And at such a place as is thoght most conuenient. In this Bower is a faire Tombe, whereon, in Armour lyeth the imaginary body of Sir <hi>William Walworth</hi>, sometime twise Lord Maior of London, and a famous Brother of the Fishmongers Company. The reason of this conceit, aimeth at that tempestuous and troublesome time of King Richard the Second, and the fourth yeare of his Raigne, whose life, Crowne and Dignitie (next vnder Gods omnipotent power) were manfully defended and preserued, by that worthy man Walworth. </p>
          <pb xml:id="ep000796-006-b"/>
          <p>Suppose his Marble Statue (after the manner of Knightly buriall) to lye vpon the Tombe, and both it and the Bower to be worthily attended, by those fiue Knights in Armour, and mounted on Horsebacke, that were Knighted with Sir William in the field, after he had slaine the proud insulting Rebell, Captaine and ring-leader to all the rest. Sixe Trumpetters well mounted and appointed, with Trumpet banners of the Companies Armes, and a gallant guard of Halberdiers, being 24. in number, with watchet silke Coats, hauing the Fishmongers Armes on the brest, Sir <hi>William Walworths </hi>on the backe, and the Citties on the left arme, white Hats and Feathers, and goodly Halbards in their hands: these likewise haue their rancke and place neere to the Tombe and <hi>Bower. Londons Genius</hi>, a comely Youth, attired in the shape of an Angell, with a golden Crowne on his head, golden Wings at his backe, bearing a golden Wand in his hand, sits mounted on Horsebacke by the Bower; with an Officer at Armes, bearing the Rebels head on Walworths Dagger. So soone as the Lord Maior is come neere, and way made for his better attention: the Genius speaketh, the Trumpets sound their seuerall Surden flourishes, Walworth ariseth, and is conuaid on Horsebacke from the Bower, as you may better perceiue by the speeches apted for the purpose. The Bower and Tombe are likewise borne along before him, for his more conuenient returne to rest againe. </p>
          <p>Wee come now to our last inuention in this our Triumphall Progresse, memorizing Londons great <pb xml:id="ep000796-007-a"/>day of deliuerance, and the Fishmongers Fame for euer, in Anno 1381. and on <foreign xml:lang="lat">Corpus Christi </foreign>day in West Smithfield, where the like number of Rebels (as then) were neuer assembled. Leauing the matter, a case of desperate Rebellion; the manner, a most base and barbarous kinde of proceeding, to the great disturbance of the King and State, and vnauoydable ruine of this Cittie, but for the good Angell of defence then guarding it, and the worthy Lord Maior made the second instrument: let vs imagine (though not in the magnificent forme as then it was done, yet according to our compasse of performance) that whatsoeuer hath formerly been sayd concerning Walworths reuiuing at the Tombe, his Royall attending, and the beautifull Monument following, is all but a shaddow of that triumphant victorie in our aptest allusion. </p>
          <p>Our Pageant Chariot, is drawne by two Mare-men, &amp; two Mare-mayds, as being the supporters to the Companies coate of Armes. In the highest seate of eminence, sits the triumphing Angell, who that day smote the enemy by Walworths hand, and laid all his proud presuming in the dust. With one hand (King Richard sitting in a degree beneath her) she holds his Crowne on fast, that neither forraine Hostilitie, nor home-bred Trecherie should euer more shake it. In the other hand hee holds his striking Rodde, inferring thus much thereby: <hi>By mee Kings reigne, and their enemies are scattered. </hi>All the forefront is beautified with Royall Vertues, as Truth, Vertue, Honor, Temperance, Fortitude, Zeale, Equity, Conscience, beating downe <pb xml:id="ep000796-007-b"/>Treason and Mutinie. Behind, and on the sides, sits Iustice, Authority, Lawe, Vigilancy, Peace, Plentie and Discipline, as best props and pillers to any Kingly estate. These, as all the rest, are best obserued by their seuerall Emblems and properties, borne by each one, and their adornments answerable to them in like manner. </p>
          <p>Hauing thus briefly described the order of the daies seruice, insomuch as appertaineth to my charge and place, (not omitting the Fishing-Busse, Dolphine, Mer-man and Mer-mayd vpon the water first, and afterward marshalled in such forme as you haue heard on land:) wee come to set downe the Speeches, according as they are appointed to be spoken, beginning first at the Bower and Tombe in Paules-Church-yard, after my Lords returne from Westminster, where the Citties Genius thus beginneth. </p>
