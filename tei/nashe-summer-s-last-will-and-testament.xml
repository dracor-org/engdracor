        <p>NOctem peccatis, &amp; fraudibus obiice nubem. There is no such fine time to play the knaue in, as the night. I am a Goose or a Ghost at least; for what with turmoyle of getting my fooles apparell, and care of being perfit, I am sure I haue not yet supt to night. Will Summers Ghost I should be, come to present you with Summers last will, and Testament. Be it so, if my cousin Ned will lend me his Chayne and his Fiddle. Other stately pac't Prologues vse to attire themselues within: I that haue a toy in my head, more then ordinary, and vse to goe without money, without garters, without girdle, without a hat-band, without poynts to my hose, without a knife to my dinner, and make so much vse of this word without, in euery thing, will here dresse me without. Dick Huntley cryes, Begin, begin: and all the whole house, For shame come away; when I had my things but now brought me out of the Lawndry. God forgiue me, I did not see my Lord before. Ile set a good face on it, as though what I had talkt idly all this while, were my part. So it is, boni viri, that one foole presents another; and I a foole by nature, and by arte, do speake to you in the person of the Idiot our Play-maker. He like a Foppe &amp; an Asse, must be making himselfe a publike laughing stock, &amp; haue no thanke for his labor; where other Magisterij, whose inuention is farre more exquisite, are content to sit still, and doe nothing. Ile shewe you what a <pb xml:id="ep000216-003-a"/>scuruy Prologue he had made me in an old vayne of similitudes: if you bee good fellowes, giue it the hearing, that you may iudge of him thereafter. </p>
        <p>The Prologue. </p>
        <p>AT a solemne feast of the Triumuiri in Rome, it was seene and obserued, that the birds ceased to sing, &amp; sate solitarie on the house tops, by reason of the sight of a paynted Serpent set openly to view. So fares it with vs nouices, that here betray our imperfections: we, afraid to looke on the imaginary serpent of Enuy, paynted in mens affections, haue ceased to tune any musike of mirth to your eares this tweluemonth, thinking, that as it is the nature of the serpent to hisse: so childhood and ignorance would play the goslings, contemning, and condemning what they vnderstood not. Their censures we wey not, whose sences are not yet vnswadled. The little minutes will be continually striking, though no man regard them. Whelpes will barke, before they can see, and striue to byte, before they haue teeth. Politianus speaketh of a beast, who, while hee is cut on the table, drinketh, and represents the motions &amp; voyces of a liuing creature. Such like foolish beasts are we, who, whilest we are cut, mocked, &amp; flowted at, in euery mans common talke, will notwithstanding proceed to shame our selues, to make sport. No man pleaseth all, we seeke to please one. Didymus wrote foure thousand bookes, or as some say, six thousand, of the arte of Grammar. Our Authour hopes, it may be as lawfull for him to write a thousand lines of as light a subiect. Socrates (whom the Oracle pronounced the wisest man of Greece) sometimes daunced. Scipio and Lelius by the sea-side played at peeble-stone. Semel insaniuimus omnes. Euery man cannot, with Archimedes, make a heauen of brasse, or dig gold out of the iron mynes of the lawe. Such odde trifles, as Mathematicians experiments be, Artificiall flyes to hang in the ayre by themselues, daunsing balles, an egge-shell that shall clyme vp to the top of a speare, fiery breathing goares, Poetae noster professeth not to make. Placeat sibi quisque heebit. What's a foole but his bable? Deepe reaching wits, heere is no deepe <pb xml:id="ep000216-003-b"/>streame for you to angle in. Moralizers, you that wrest a neuer meant meaning, out of euery thing, applying all things to the present time, keepe your attention for the common Stage: for here are no quips in Characters for you to reade. Vayne glozers, gather what you will. Spite, spell backwards, what thou canst. As the Parthians fight, flying away: so will wee prate and talke, but stand to nothing that we say. </p>
        <p>How say you, my masters, doe you not laugh at him for a Coxcombe? Why, he hath made a Prologue longer then his Play: nay, 'tis no Play neyther, but a shewe. Ile be sworne, the figge of Rowlands God-sonne, is a Gyant in comparison of it. What can be made of Summers last will &amp; Testament? Such another thing, as Cyllian of Braynfords will, where shee bequeathed a score of farts amongst her friends. Forsooth, because the plague raignes in most places in this latter end of summer, Summer must come in sicke: he must call his officers to account, yeeld his throne to Autumne, make Winter his Executour, with tittle tattle Tom boy: God giue you good night in Watling street. I care not what I say now: for I play no more then you heare; &amp; some of that you heard to (by your leaue) was extempore. He were as good haue let me had the best part: for Ile be reueng'd on him to the vttermost, in this person of Will Summer, which I haue put on to play the Prologue, and meane not to put off, till the play be done. Ile sit as a Chorus, and flowte the Actors and him at the end of euery Sceane: I know they will not interrupt me, for feare of marring of all: but looke to your cues, my masters; for I intend to play the knaue in cue, and put you besides all your parts, if you take not the better heede. Actors, you Rogues, come away, cleare your throats, blowe your noses, and wype your mouthes e're you enter, that you may take no occasion to spit or to cough, when you are non plus. And this I barre ouer and besides, That none of you stroake your beardes, to make action, play with your cod-piece poynts, or stand fumbling on your buttom, when you know not how to bestow your fingers. Serue God, and act cleanly; a fit of mirth, and an old song first, if you will. </p>

          <p>Tell me, I pray, wherefore was gold layd vnder our feete in the veynes of the earth, but that wee should contemne it, and treade vpon it, and so consequently treade thrift vnder our feete? It was not knowne, till the Iron age, donec facinus inuasit mortales, as the Poet sayes; and the Scythians alwayes detested it. I will proue it, that an vnthrift, of any, comes neerest a happy man, in so much as he comes neerest to beggery. Cicero saith, summum bonum consistes in omnium rerum vacatione, that it is the chiefest felicitie that may be, to rest from all labours. Now, who doeth so much vacare à rebus, who rests so much? who hath so little to doe, as the begger? Who can sing so merry a note, as he that cannot change a groate? Cui nil est, nil deest: hee that hath nothing, wants nothing. On the other side, it is said of the Carle, Omnia habeo, nec quicquam habeo: I haue all things, yet want euery thing. Multi mihi vitio vertunt, quia egeo, saith Marcus Cato in Aulus Gellius, at ego illis, quia nequeunt egere: Many vpbrayde me, sayth he, because I am poore: but I vpbrayd them, because they cannot liue if they were poore. It is a common prouerbe, Dinesque miserque, a rich man, and a miserable: nam natura paucis contenta, none so contented as the poore man. Admit that the chiefest happines were not rest or ease, but knowledge, as Herillus, Alcidamas, &amp; many of Socrates followers affirme; why, paupertas omnes perdocot artes, pouerty instructs a man in all arts, it makes a man hardy and venturous; and therefore it is called of the Poets, Paupertas audax, valiant pouerty. It is not so much subiect to inordinate desires, as wealth or prosperity. Non habet vnde suum paupertas pascat amorem: pouerty hath not wherewithall to feede lust. All the Poets were beggers: all Alcumists, and all Philosophers are beggers: Omnia mea mecum porto, quoth Bias, when he had nothing, but bread and cheese in a letherne bagge, and two or three bookes in his bosome. Saint Frauncis, a holy Saint, &amp; neuer had any money. It is madnes to dote vpon mucke. That young man of Athens, (Aelianus makes mention of) may be an example to vs, who <pb xml:id="ep000216-007-a"/>doted so extremely on the image of Fortune, that when hee might not inioy it, he dyed for sorrow. The earth yelds all her fruites together, and why should not we spend them together? I thanke heauens on my knees, that haue made mee an vnthrift. </p>

What cheere, what cheere, my hearts? are not you thirsty with listening to this dry sport? What haue we to doe with scales, and hower-glasses, except we were Bakers, or Clock-keepers? I cannot tell how other men are addicted, but it is against my profession to vse any scales, but such as we play at with a boule, or keepe any howers, but dinner or supper. It is a pedanticall thing, to respect times and seasons: if a man be drinking with good fellowes late, he must come home, for feare the gates be shut; when I am in my warme bed, I must rise to prayers, because the bell rings. I like no such foolish customes. Actors, bring now a black Iack, and a rundlet of of Renish wine, disputing of the antiquity of red noses; let the prodigall childe come out in his dublet and hose all greasy, his shirt hanging forth, and ne're a penny in his purse, and talke what a fine thing it is to walke summerly, or sit whistling vnder a hedge and keepe hogges.

Troth, I am of opinion, he is one of those Hieroglificall writers, that by the figures of beasts, planets, and of stones, expresse the mind, as we doe in A. B. C. or one that writes vnder hayre, as I haue heard of a certaine Notary Histions, who following Darius in the Persian warres, and desirous to disclose some secrets of import, to his friend Aristagoras, that dwelt afarre off, found out this meanes: He had a seruant that had bene <pb xml:id="ep000216-011-a"/>long sicke of a payne in his eyes, whom, vnder pretence of curing his maladie, he shau'd from one side of his head, to the other, and with a soft pensill wrote vpon his scalpe, (as on parchment) the discourse of his busines, the fellow all the while imagining, his master had done nothing but noynt his head with a feather. After this, hee kept him secretly in his tent, till his hayre was somewhat growne, and then wil'd him to go to Aristagoras into the countrey, and bid him shaue him, as he had done, and he should haue perfit remedie. He did so: Aristagoras shau'd him with his owne hands, read his friends letter; and when hee had done, washt it out, that no man should perceyue it else, and sent him home to buy him a night-cap. If I wist there were any such knauery, or Peter Bales Brachigraphy, vnder Sols bushy hayre, I would haue a Barber, my hoste of the Murrions head, to be his Interpretour, who would whet his rasor on his Richmond cap, and giue him the terrible cut, like himselfe, but he would come as neere as a quart pot, to the construction of it. To be sententious, not superfluous, Sol should haue bene beholding to the Barbour, and not the beard-master. Is it pride that is shadowed vnder <ref target="A08009-e104180-b"/>

          <l>Which no one of experience will deny, </l>
          <l>They heare, they smell, they see better then we, </l>

          <l>They barke as good old Saxon as may be, </l>
          <l>And that in more varietie then we: </l>
          <l>For they haue one voice when they are in chase, </l>
          <l>Another, when they wrangle for their meate, </l>
          <l>Another, when we beate them out of dores. </l>
          <l>That they haue reason, this I will alleadge, </l>
          <l>They choose those things that are most fit for them, </l>
          <l>And shunne the contrarie all that they may, </l>
          <l>They know what is for their owne diet best, </l>
          <l>And seeke about for't very carefully. </l>
          <l>At sight of any whip they runne away, </l>
          <l>As runs a thiefe from noise of hue and crie: </l>
          <l>Nor liue they on the sweat of others browes, </l>
          <l>But haue their trades to get their liuing with, </l>
          <l>Hunting and conie-catching, two fine artes: </l>
          <l>Yea, there be of them as there be of men, </l>
          <l>Of euerie occupation more or lesse: </l>
          <l>Some cariers, and they fetch, some watermen, </l>
          <l>And they will diue and swimme when you bid them: </l>
          <l>Some butchers, and they worrie sheep by night: </l>
          <l>Some cookes, and they do nothing but turne spits. </l>
          <l>Chrisippus holds, dogs are Logicians, </l>
          <l>In that by studie and by canuasing, </l>
          <l>They can distinguish twixt three seuerall things, </l>
          <l>As when he commeth where three broad waies meet, </l>

          <l>By which he gesseth that the game went not, </l>
          <l>Without more pause he runneth on the third, </l>
          <l>Which, as Chrisippus saith, insinuates, </l>
          <l>As if he reason'd thus within himselfe: </l>

          <l>But whether they Logicians be or no, </l>
          <l>Cinicks they are, for they will snarle and bite, </l>
          <l>Right courtiers to flatter and to fawne, </l>
          <l>Valiant to set vpon the enemies, </l>
          <l>Most faithfull and most constant to their friends; </l>
          <l>Nay they are wise, as Homer witnesseth, </l>
          <l>Who talking of Vlisses comming home, </l>
          <l>Saith all his houshold, but Argus his Dogge, </l>

          <l>Nor his base weeds, nor absence twenty yeares, </l>
          <l>Could go beyond, or any way delude. </l>
          <l>That Dogges Phisicians are, thus I inferre, </l>
          <l>They are ne're sicke, but they know their disease, </l>
          <l>And finde out meanes to ease them of their griefe, </l>
          <l>Speciall good Surgions to cure dangerous wounds: </l>
          <l>For strucken with a stake into the flesh, </l>
          <l>This policie they vse to get it out: </l>
          <l>They traile one of their feet vpon the ground, </l>
          <l>And gnaw the flesh about where the wound is, </l>
          <l>Till it be cleane drawne out: and then, because </l>
          <l>Vlcers and sores kept fowle, are hardly cur'de, </l>
          <l>They licke and purifie it with their tongue, </l>
          <l>And well obserue Hipocrates old rule, </l>
          <l>The onely medicine for the foote, is rest: </l>
          <l>For if they haue the least hurt in their feet, </l>
          <l>They beare them vp, and looke they be not stird: </l>
          <l>When humours rise, they eate a soueraigne herbe, </l>
          <l>Whereby what cloyes their stomacks, they cast vp, </l>

If I had thought the ship of fooles would haue stayde to take in fresh water at the Ile of dogges, I would haue furnisht it with a whole kennell of collections to the purpose. I haue had a dogge my selfe, that would dreame, and talke in his sleepe, turne round like Ned foole, and sleepe all night in a porridge pot. Marke but the skirmish betweene sixpence and the foxe, and it is miraculous, how they ouercome one another in honorable curtesy. The foxe, though he weares a chayne, runnes as though hee were free, mocking vs (as it is a crafty beast) because we hauing a Lord and master to attend on, runne about at our pleasures, like masterles men. Young sixpence, the best page his master hath, playes a little, and retires. I warrant, he will not be farre out of the way, when his master goes to dinner. Learne of him, you deminitiue vrchins, howe to behaue your selues in your vocation, take not vp your standings in a nut-tree, when you should be waiting on my Lords trencher. Shoote but a bit at buttes, play but a span at poyntes. What euer you doe, memento mori: remember to rise betimes in the morning. </p>

          <p>Why, Summer, Summer, how would'st doe, but for rayne? What is a faire house without water comming to it? Let mee see how a smith can worke, if hee haue not his trough standing by him. What sets an edge on a knife? the grindstone alone? no, the moyst element powr'd vpon it, which grinds out all gaps, sets a poynt vpon it, &amp; scowres it as bright as the firmament. So, I tell thee, giue a soldier wine before he goes to battaile, it grinds out all gaps, it makes him forget all scarres and wounds, and fight in the thickest of his enemies, as though hee were but at foyles, amongst his fellows. Giue a scholler wine, going to his booke, or being about to inuent, it sets a new poynt on his wit, it glazeth it, it scowres it, it giues him acumen. Plato saith, vinum esse fomitem quendam, et incit abilem ingenij virtutisque. Aristotle saith, Nulla est magna scientia absque mixtura dementiae. There is no excellent knowledge without mixture of madnesse. And what makes a man more madde in the head then wine? Qui bene vult poyein, debet axtá pinyen, he that will doe well, must drinke well. Prome, prome, potum prome: Ho butler, a fresh pot. Nunc est bibendum, nunc pede libero terra pulsanda: a pox on him that leaues his drinke behinde him; hey Rendouow. </p>

Me thinkes these are good houshold termes; Wil it please you to be here, sir? I commend me to you: shall I be so bold as trouble you? sauing your tale I drink to you. And if these were put in practise but a yeare or two in tauernes, wine would soone fall from six and twentie pound a tunne, and be beggers money, a penie a quart, and take vp his Inne with wast beere in the almes tub.

          <p>No other reason, but that Gluttony is a sinne, &amp; too many dunghils are infectious. A mans belly was not made for a poudring beefe tub: to feede the poore twelue dayes, &amp; let them starue all the yeare after, would but stretch out the guts wider then they should be, &amp; so make famine a bigger den in their bellies, then he had before.

The scraping of trenchers you thinke would put a man to no charges. It is not a hundreth pound a yeare would serue the scullions in dishclouts. My house stands vpon vaults, it will fall if it be ouer-loden with a multitude. Besides, haue you neuer read of a city that was vnderminde and destroyed by Mowles? So, say I keepe hospitalitie, and a whole faire of beggers bid me to dinner euery day, what with making legges, when they thanke me at their going away, and setling their wallets handsomly on their backes, they would shake as many lice on the ground, as were able to vndermine my house, and vndoe me vtterly: It is their prayers would builde it againe, if it were ouerthrowne by this vermine, would it? I pray, who begun feasting, and gourmandize first, but Sardanapalus, Nero, Heliogabalus, Commodus, tyrants, whoremasters, vnthrifts? Some call them Emperours, but I respect no crownes, but crownes in the purse. Any man may weare a siluer crowne, that hath made a fray in Smithfield, &amp; lost but a peece of his braine pan. And to tell you plaine, your golden crownes are little better in substance, and many times got after the same sort. </p>

The court accepts of your meaning; you might haue writ in the margent of your play-booke, Let there be a fewe rushes laide in the place where Back-winter shall tumble, for feare of raying his cloathes: or set downe, Enter Back-winter, with his boy, bringing a brush after him, to take off the dust if need require. But you will ne're haue any ward-robe wit while you liue. I pray you holde the booke well, we be not nonplus in the latter end of the play. </p>

        <p>VLisses a Dwarffe, and the prolocutor for the Graecians, gaue me leaue that am a Pigmee, to doe an Embassage to you from the Cranes: Gentlemen (for Kings are no better) certaine humble Animals, called our Actors, commend them vnto you; who, what offence they haue committed, I know not (except it be in purloyning some houres out of times treasury, that might haue beene better imployde; but by me (the agent for their imperfections) they humbly craue pardon, if happily some of their termes haue trodde awrye, or their tongues stumbled vnwittingly on any mans content. In much Corne is some Cockle; in a heape of coyne heere and there a peece of Copper; wit hath his dregs as well as wine; words their waste, Inke his blots, euery speech his Parenthesis, Poetical fury, as well Crabbes as Sweetings for his Summer fruites. Nemo sapit omnibus horis. Their folly is deceased, their feare is yet liuing. Nothing can kill an Asse but colde: colde entertainement, discouraging scoffes, authorized disgraces, may kill a whole litter of young Asses of them heere at once, that haue traueld thus farre in impudence, onely in hope to sit a sunning in your smiles. The Romanes dedicated a Temple to the feuer quartane, thinking it some great God, because it shooke them so: and another, to Ill fortune in Exquilliis a Mountaine in Roome, that it should not plague them at Cardes and Dice. Your Graces frownes are to them shaking feuers, your least disfauours, the greatest ill fortune that may betide them. They can builde no Temples, but themselues and their best indeuours, with all prostrate reuerence, they here dedicate and offer vp, wholy to your seruice. Sis bonus, O faelixque tuis. To make the gods merry, the coelestiall clowne Vulcan tun'de his polt foote, to the measures of Apolloes Lute, and daunst a limping Gallyard in Ioues starrie hall. <pb xml:id="ep000216-030-a"/>To make you merry that are the Gods of Art, and guides vnto heauen, a number of rude Vulcans, vnweldy speakers, hammer-headed clownes (for so it pleaseth them in modestie to name themselues) haue set their deformities to view, as it were in a daunce here before you. Beare with their wants, lull melancholie asleepe with their absurdities, and expect hereafter better fruites of their industrie. Little creatures often terrifie great beasts: the Elephant flyeth from a Ramme, the Lyon from a Cock and from fire; the Crocodile from all Sea-fish, the Whale from the noyse of parched bones; light toyes chase great cares. The great foole Toy hath marde the play: Good night, Gentlemen; I go, let him be carryed away. </p>
        <p>WilSummer. Is't true Iackanapes, doo you serue me so? As sure as this coate is too short for me, all the Points of your hoase for this are condemnde to my pocket, if you and I e're play at spanne Counter more. Valete, spectatores, pay for this sport with a Plaudite, and the next time the winde blowes from this corner, we will make you ten times as merry. </p>
