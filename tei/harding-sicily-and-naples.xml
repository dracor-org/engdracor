        <p>IN Publishing this Tragoedy I have so farre sinn'd against the modesty of my friend, that there is nothing sufficient to to excuse mee, but thy favour: Those that have dar'd dislike it already, would grow proud, if by presenting it to the common view, I did not shew for what a nothing I esteeme their censures; whatsoever syllable there be, that they ever cavill'd at, is therefore not omitted, that thou may'st have wherein, or to laugh at their vaine Criticising, or to shew thine owne candour; I doubt not but in thy approbation they shall see, what poore imaginary Hercules's they were that had no other Monsters to combat here, but what themselves made. That it was envy'd the glory which it might have receiv'd from the Stage, may be one reason to commend it to thee, since in this kinde there is little now adaies not applauded, but what is good: And for mine owne part I was never so maliciously uncharitable, as to goe about to undoe at once, the Stationer, and my Friend's credit. Thou shalt pardon mee this onely fault, that I have hereby dull'd that praise, which thy selfe might'st have receiv'd in making a good play, since I have layd before thee so faire a copy to write by. I dare not hope but it will be equally unexpected, and unwelcome to the Authour, to see the world acquainted with this toy, (as hee usually termes it,) which himselfe hath by this even learn'd to forget: Thy acceptance shall be my apology to him, and indeed I may justly challenge of thee a more than ordinary good will, since I have hazarded the losse of his love, onely that I might shew my selfe </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
