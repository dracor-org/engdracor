        <p>HOw much I acknowledge my selfe bound for your so many, &amp; extraordinary fauors confer'd vpon me, as farre as it is in my power posterity shall take notice, I were most vnworthy of such noble friends, if I should not with all Thankefulnesse, professe, and owne em. In the composition of this Tragaedie you were my only Supporters, and it being now by your principall encouragement to be turn'd into the world, it cannot walke safer, then vnder your protection. It hath beene happie <pb xml:id="ep000172-003-a"/>in the suffrage of some learned, and judicious Gentlemen when it was presented, nor shall they find cause I hope in the pervsall, to repent them of their good opinion of it. If the grauity and height of the subject distaste such as are onely affected with Iigges, and ribaldrie (as I presume it will,) their condemnation of me, and my Poem, can no way offend me: my reason teaching me such malicious, and ignorant detractors deserue rather cöntempt, then satisfaction. I euer held it the most perfit birth of my Minerua; and therefore, in justice offer it to those that haue best deseru'd of me, who I hope in their courteous acceptance will render it worth their receiuing, and euer, in their gentle construction of my imperfections, beleeue they may at their pleasure dispose of him, that is wholly, and sincerelie </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
