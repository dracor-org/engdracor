        <p>SIr, I have long cherished a desire, by some worthy testimony, to expresse how much I honour you: But after a tedious expectation, hopelesse to meete with an occasion to make me so fortunate; I resolued, rather then to hazard the censure of neglect, to snatch any opportunity of presenting my seruices. This (which to me hath no name, but what your bounty shall bestow) hauing pleased you vpon <pb xml:id="ep000279-003-a"/>the Stage, comming into the world, offereth it selfe to kisse your hand. If you be merciful, I am vpon euen termes with the world beside, and will study next to reach your minde with imaginations of a higher nature. In the meane time, grow you vp, and ripen your selfe for Honour; the flowings of your blood will instruct you how to merit; while I rest content with my ambition, if I may still write my selfe, </p>
        <signed>Your deuoted Seruant, I. SHERLEY. </signed>
