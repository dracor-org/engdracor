        <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>THIS Play was Written by the Author in France above twelve Years past, without any design of becoming Publick, but only as an Exercise to learn to Write, at an Age when many are but beginning to Spell. It was afterwards accidentally communicated to some Persons, and begg'd by a Friend, who propos'd to make some Advantage by it, which was consented to upon Promise that the Author should never be nam'd. Thus it remain'd for some Years in other Hands, till at last the Author was importun'd to own it, or his Friend had been <pb xml:id="ep000614-004-a"/>disappointed. Some few Alterations were made to suit it only to the present time of Acting; in every thing else the Play is the same as at first, even to the Songs, and the Epilogue as it is printed. If his Friend has had a Third Day to his Satisfaction, it is all the end that the Author propos'd to himself: And if before the ordinary Age of Manhood, he shall be allow'd not to have been wholly Impotent, it is all the Commendation he expects. Of which the Reader is left to judge as he thinks fit. </p>

        <head>Prologue to the SHE-GALLANTS, Spoke by Mr. BETTERTON. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>AS quiet Monarchs that on peaceful Thrones </l>
          <l>In Sports and Revels long had Reign'd like Drones: </l>
          <l>Rousing at length, reflect with Guilt and Shame, </l>
          <l>That not One Stroke had yet been giv'n for Fame; </l>
          <l>Wars they proclaim, and to redeem the past, </l>
          <l>To bold Attempts and rugged Labours haste. </l>
          <l>Our Poet so: with like Concern reviews </l>
          <l>The Youthful Follies of his Love-sick Muse. </l>
          <l>To Amorous Toils, and to the Silent Grove; </l>
          <l>To Beauty's Snares, and to deceitful Love, </l>
          <l>He bids Farewel: His Shield and Launce prepares, </l>
          <l>And mounts the Stage, to bid Immortal Wars. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Vice, like some Monster, suff'ring none t'escape, </l>
          <l>Has seiz'd the Town, and varies still her Shape. </l>
          <l>Here, like a General, she struts in State, </l>
          <l>While Crowds in Red and Blue her Orders wait. </l>
          <l>There, like some pensive Statesman, walks Demure, </l>
          <l>And smiles and huggs, to make Destruction sure. </l>
          <l>Now under high Commodes with Looks Erect, </l>
          <l>Bare-fac'd devours in gawdy Colours deck. </l>
          <l>Then in a Vizard, to avoid Grimace, </l>
          <l>Allows all Freedom but to see the Face. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>In Pulpits and at Bar, she wears a Gown; </l>
          <l>In Camps a Sword, in Palaces a Crown. </l>
          <l>Resolv'd to Combat with this Motly Beast, </l>
          <l>Our Poet comes to strike One Stroke at least. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>His Glass he means, not for this Iilt or Beau, </l>
          <l>Some Features of you all he hopes to shew </l>
          <l>On chosen Heads; nor lets the Thunder fall, </l>
          <l>But scatters his Artillery at All. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Yet to the Fair he sain wou'd Quarter show, </l>
          <l>His tender Heart recoils at every Blow. </l>
          <l>If unawares he give too smart a Stroke, </l>
          <l>He means but to Correct, and not Provoke. </l>

And what may seem yet more Bizarre, the Man in the World whom I have always us'd worst, is he whom I have lov'd best. I know what Dissemblers are Men, and am resolv'd to enquire thorowly into my Lover, before I discover my Inclinations. If I find Frederick loves me sincerely, and is a Man of Honour, I will then explain my self in his favour: But if I prove him unworthy, my Aversion, that is now but Pretence, shall be real, and he shall never so much as suspect that I have had the least good thought of him. </p>

Thus have I many opportunities to pry into his most secret affections, to examin his humour, and sound him to the bottom: But the Jest on't is, that he has propos'd a cross Match to me, proffering me the choice of his four Sisters, provided I will undertake to persuade Constantia to relent; to which I have agreed, and have accordingly made formal Address to all four. </p>

As these are a Prey to Age and Infirmities, so are those to every frivolous Interest and idle Temptation. Their Love is never so firm and well-establish'd, but it is sacrific'd every hour to their Folly, or their Pride.&#8212; </p>

In the Park, I turn as she turns; I go out, when she goes out; I drive by her Coach, then stop, and go softly, till she goes by again; then gallop, Beged, till I overtake her once more; and so twenty times together, ogling like a Devil, till I see where she alights, there I alight too; and, Beged, she never makes a Visit, but I am up Stairs as soon as she. The World takes notice of these Assiduities, and being always glad of any opportunity to defame, my happiness is every where publisht; my Friends give me joy of my success, which I receive with an O Gad, why shou'd you think so? What can a Woman see in me? This Town is a strange place, that a man can do nothing in secret, Geddemme, I can't imagin how this came to be found out; for, beged, I took all the care in the World to be discreet, but these foolish Women always betray themselves&#8212; And so, Geddemme, half avowing, and half denying, I palm my self upon a Woman&#8212; </p>
