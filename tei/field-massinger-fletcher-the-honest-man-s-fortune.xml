              <p>You are a merry man sir, and I am glad you take your crosses so temperately; fare you well sir, and yet I have something more to say to ye, a word in your eare I pray; to be plaine with you I did lay this plot to arrest you to enjoy this money I have of yours, with the more safety. I am a foole to tell you this now; but in good faith I could not keepe it in. And the money wo'd a done me little good else. An honest Citizen cannot wholly enjoy his own wife for you, they grow old before they have true use of them, which is a lamentable thing, and truely much hardens the hearts of us Citizens against you: I can say no more, but am heartily sorry for your heavinesse, and so I take my leave. </p>

        <head>Vpon an Honest Mans Fortune. </head>
        <byline>By Mr. John Fletcher. </byline>
        <l>YOu that can look through Heaven, and tell the Stars, </l>
        <l>Observe their kind conjunctions, and their wars; </l>
        <l>Find out new lights, and give them where you please, </l>
        <l>To those men honors, pleasures, to those ease; </l>
        <l>You that are Gods surveyers, and can show </l>
        <l>How far, and when, and why the wind doth blow; </l>
        <l>Know all the charges of the dreadfull thunder, </l>
        <l>And when it will shoot over, or fall under: </l>
        <l>Tell me, by all your art I conjure ye, </l>
        <l>Yes, and by truth, what shall become of me? </l>
        <l>Find out my star, if each one, as you say, </l>
        <l>Have his peculiar Angel, and his way; </l>
        <l>Observe my fate, next fall into your dreames, </l>
        <l>Sweep clean your houses, and new line your sceames, </l>
        <l>Then say your worst: or have I none at all? </l>
        <l>Or is it burnt out lately? or did fall? </l>
        <l>Or am I poor, not able, no full flame? </l>
        <l>My star, like me, unworthy of a name? </l>
        <l>Is it, your art can only work on those </l>
        <l>That deale with dangers, dignities, and cloaths? </l>
        <l>With love, or new opinions? you all lye, </l>
        <l>A fishwife hath a fate, and so have I, </l>
        <l>But far above your finding; he that gives, </l>
        <l>Out of his providence, to all that lives, </l>
        <l>And no man knowes his treasure, no not you: </l>
        <l>He that made Egypt blind, from whence you grew </l>
        <l>Scaby and lowsy, that the world might see </l>
        <l>Your calculations are as blind as ye, </l>
        <l>He that made all the stars, you dayly read, </l>
        <l>And from thence filtch a knowledge how to feed; </l>
        <l>Hath hid this from you, your conjectures all </l>
        <l>Are drunken things, not how, but when they fall; </l>
        <l>Man is his own star, and the soule that can </l>
        <l>Render an honest, and a perfect man </l>
        <l>Command all light, all influence, all fate, </l>
        <l>Nothing to him fals early or too late. </l>
        <l>Our acts our Angels arc, or good or ill, </l>
        <l>Our fatall shadowes that walke by us still, </l>
        <l>And when the stars are labouring, we believe </l>
        <l>Jt is not that they govern, but they grive </l>
        <l>For stubborn ignorance; all things that are </l>
        <l>Made for our generall uses are at war, </l>
        <l>Even we among our selves, and from the strife </l>
        <l>Your first unlike opinions got a life. </l>
        <l>O man, thou image of thy makers good, </l>
        <l>What canst thou fear, when breath'd into thy blood </l>
        <l>His spirit is, that built thee? what dull sence </l>
        <l>Makes thee suspect, in need, that providence? </l>
        <l>Who made the morning, and who plact the light </l>
        <l>Guid to thy labours? who cal'd up the night, </l>
        <l>And bid her fall upon thee, like sweet showers </l>
        <l>In hollow murmurs, to lock up thy powers? </l>
        <l>Who gave thee knowledge, who so trusted thee, </l>
        <l>To let thee grow so neer himselfe, the Tree? </l>
        <l>Must he then be distrusted? shall his frame </l>
        <l>Discourse with him, why thus, and thus I am? </l>
        <l>He made the Angels thine, thy fellowes all, </l>
        <l>Nay even thy servants, when devotions call. </l>
        <l>Oh canst thou be so stupid then, so dim, </l>
        <l>To seek a saving influence, and loose him? </l>
        <l>Can Stars protect thee? or can poverty, </l>
        <l>Which is the light to Heaven, put out his eye? </l>
        <l>He is my star, in him all truth I find, </l>
        <l>All influence, all fate, and when my mind </l>
        <l>Is furnished with his fullnesse, my poor story </l>
        <l>Shall outlive all their Age, and all their glory. </l>
        <l>The hand of danger cannot fall amisse, </l>
        <l>When I know what, and in whose power it is. </l>
        <l>Nor Want, the cause of man, shall make me groan, </l>
        <l>A holy hermit is a mind alone. </l>
        <l>Doth not experience teach us all we can </l>
        <l>To work our selves into a glorious man? </l>
        <l>Love's but an exhalation to best eyes </l>
        <l>The matter spent, and then the fooles fire dyes? </l>
        <l>Were I in love, and could that bright star bring </l>
        <l>Increase to wealth, honour, and every thing: </l>
        <l>Were she as perfect good as wee can aime, </l>
        <l>The first was so, and yet she lost the Game. </l>
        <l>My mistris then be knowledge and faire truth; </l>
        <l>So I enjoy all beauty and all youth, </l>
        <l>And though to time her lights and lawes she lends, </l>
        <l>She knowes no Age that to corruption bends. </l>
        <l>Friends promises may lead me to believe, </l>
        <l>But he that is his own friend knowes to live. </l>
        <l>Affliction when J know it is but this, </l>
        <l>A deep allay whereby man tougher is </l>
        <l>To bear the hammer, and the deeper still, </l>
        <l>We still arise more image of his will. </l>
        <l>Sicknesse an humorous cloud twixt us and light, </l>
        <l>And Death, at longest but another night. </l>
        <l>Man is his own Star, and that soule that can </l>
        <l>Be honest is the only perfect man. </l>
