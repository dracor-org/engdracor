        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>AS a brisk Gallant dancing to his Glass, </l>
        <l>Does here and there in nimble fleurets pass; </l>
        <l>Likes every step, and wishes for a Ball, </l>
        <l>Where he at once may shew his Parts to all: </l>
        <l>So Poets (with the like conceit) undone, </l>
        <l>Think that dull Verse which pleas'd 'em when alone, </l>
        <l>Must have the like effect on the whole Town. </l>
        <l>Our Poet all such hopes of Praise disclaimes, </l>
        <l>Like a true Lover of the Sport, he Games, </l>
        <l>And to come off a Saver only aimes. </l>
        <l>Did he affect to be esteem'd a Wit, </l>
        <l>Like you, he'd take an easier way to it: </l>
        <l>Write Songs, and Prologues, shew 'em up and down, </l>
        <l>And tear applause from every Fool in Town; </l>
        <l>Make Love to Vizards in a Wit-like Noise, </l>
        <l>Dull in his Sense, yet aiery in his Voice, </l>
        <l>Catch at each Line that grates, and keep ten good, </l>
        <l>With his damn'd Noise, from being understood. </l>
        <l>'Tis well most Wits have something of the Mad, </l>
        <l>Or where shou'd Poets for the Stage be had? </l>
        <l>Cripples may judge of Vaulting he well knows, </l>
        <l>Cowards of Courage; and of Verse and Prose </l>
        <l>They that know neither; yet if too severe </l>
        <l>Damning those Gifts of which they have no share, </l>
        <l>Their Envy more than Iudgement will appear. </l>
        <l>He none excepts, no, not his Enemies; </l>
        <l>For those he hopes his Friends will counterpoise: </l>
        <l>And spight of Faction on both sides he knows, </l>
        <l>There is an honest Party in this House. </l>
