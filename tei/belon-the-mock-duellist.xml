        <p>THe French Vallet, according to his natural Insolence, throws himself at your feet; not in his broken English, with a <hi>Begar Madam, mee voul ave it de so, </hi>but in that Dialect used by the most refin'd Wits,— <hi>Vous supplye tres humblement Le regarder d'un aspect favorable. </hi>
        </p>
        <p>Which blessing he vows is a sufficient saveguard against those three Fatalities of Books; Envy, Spight, and Malice. I know, Madam, that to have shrowded under your generous protection all that the greatest Gallantry of the two most Polite Nations of the world could have wound up to the highest sublimity of Wit, had worn some face of Justice, which might have rendred the presumption excusable; it being so generally known, that none with more reason <pb xml:id="ep000453-003-a"/>than your self, could undertake the Censure of what is so much your own; I mean <hi>La parfaite cognoissance du beau Monde. </hi>But Champagne's Crime can plead no excuse; and being beyond the reach of ordinary Clemencie, can have no other hopes, than in that goodness which shines with so much Lustre throughout all your actions. Take pitty of him, Madam; and while your hand is in, pardon also the liberty which his Advocate takes, of subscribing himself, </p>

        <l>YE who will judge, and ye that can indeed, </l>
        <l>(And Right, rather than long Prescription plead,) </l>
        <l>To both we equally do bow this night, </l>
        <l>Owning the Power of one and th'other's right. </l>
        <l>Our Poet says, h'as brought you a new Play, </l>
        <l>Or if no new dish— dress'd another way, </l>
        <l>And better too, he thinks— Plot, Humour, Wit, </l>
        <l>(The Devil's in it if it do not hit) </l>
        <l>Leading you not through horrid rugged ways; </l>
        <l>Knows better how to please, than to amaze. </l>
        <l>Of Lines of Wonder you have had enow, </l>
        <l>That pose your Intellect, and th' Authors too; </l>
        <l>And to this Ages spight will live perplex't, </l>
        <l>To dare the Vnderstanding of the next. </l>
        <l>His easier Scene no big-swoln rumbling speaks, </l>
        <l>That while you look on't, like a Bubble breaks, </l>
        <l>Tumbling along with an amazing noise; </l>
        <l>But his accoast is gentle Nature's voice. </l>
        <l>In this conceit he brisks, begins to swell, </l>
        <l>And swears he shall come off at least as well </l>
        <l>As some applauded Freemen of the Trade, </l>
        <l>Whom neither Art nor Nature Poets made. </l>
        <l>'Twere brave if 't would go thus, and you should be </l>
        <l>Perswaded to believe't as well as he. </l>
        <l>But he'll go less; for all this little Huff, </l>
        <l>At other intervals he's tame enough, </l>
        <l>And wisely then considers what is due▪ </l>
        <l>From his bold weakness, to such Powers as you; </l>
        <l>You whose Prerogative is understood </l>
        <l>To give the stamp, and make the Mettle good, </l>
        <l>With Priviledge as great and unconfin'd </l>
        <l>As his, who Leather into Money coin'd. </l>
