        <l>THe Tamer's tam'd, but so, as nor the men </l>
        <l>Can finde one just cause to complaine of, when </l>
        <l>They fitly do consider in their lives, </l>
        <l>They should not raign as Tyrants o'r their wives. </l>
        <l>Nor can the women from this president </l>
        <l>Insult, or triumph: it being aptly meant, </l>
        <l>To teach both Sexes due equality; </l>
        <l>And as they stand bound, to love mutually. </l>
        <l>If this effect, arising from a cause </l>
        <l>Well layd, and grounded, may deserve applause, </l>
        <l>We something more then hope, our honest ends </l>
        <l>Will keep the men, and women too, our friends. </l>
