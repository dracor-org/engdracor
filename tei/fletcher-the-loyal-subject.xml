              <l>Fashion their bodies new to thy direction; </l>
              <l>Then draw thou up, and shew the Prince his errours. </l>
              <l>My Sire obey'd, and did so; with all duty </l>
              <l>Inform'd the Prince, and read him all directions: </l>
              <l>This bred distaste, distaste grew up to anger, </l>
              <l>And anger into wilde words broke out thus: </l>
              <l>Well Archus, if I live but to command here, </l>
              <l>To be but Duke once, I shall then remember, </l>
              <l>I shall remember truely, trust me, I shall, </l>
              <l>And by my Fathers hand; the rest his eyes spoke. </l>
              <l>To which my Father answer'd (somewhat mov'd too) </l>
              <l>And with a vow he seal'd it: Royall sir, </l>
              <l>Since for my faith and fights, your scorne and anger </l>
              <l>Onely pursue me; if I live to that day, </l>
              <l>That day so long expected to reward me, </l>
              <l>By his so ever noble hand you swore by, </l>
              <l>And by the hand of Justice, never Armes more </l>

              <l>The Conflicts I will doe you service then in, </l>
