        <head>To His GRACE The Duke of ORMOND, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>IT is an old Observation that one Misfortune always attends another. I have sufficiently experimented it; and I may as justly say the same thing of my folly, in the Conduct of my Life, and in what relates to this Play. It was folly in me to Write at all, greater to Write no better, and chiefly to Print what I have Writ. If in any thing I have acted with Conduct and Prudence, 'tis in begging Protection for this from your Grace, who are so able to shield both this and its Author from their Enemies. And indeed, I may say it is natural in me, to claim this from you; because your Family have vouchsafed to be the Patrons of mine for several Generations. Nor shou'd I doubt your proving so to me, since you are replete with Goodness, and inherit all the Virtues of your Ancestors, had I the least Pretence to say so of my self; but I can only boast the same Zeal and Affection for your Service and Interests. </p>
        <p>I perceive that the Characters of Alboino and Rosamund are not agreeable to the present Taste of the Town; the best defence I can make is, that I have follow'd the truth of the Story, as any one will find, who will take the Pains to read it in the Fourth or Fifth Page of Machiavel's History of Florence: There are, without doubt, other faults in it, I wish, those who have the Wit to observe them, wou'd have the Candour to inform me of them, that if ever I am <pb xml:id="ep000668-004-a"/>Idle enough to write again, I might indeavour to avoid them: And tho' this shou'd abound with more, yet I fancy, there are many in this Town, who will have good or ill Nature enough to acknowledge, there are great Allowances to be made to a Man's first Play, and to a Man of Ireland. </p>
        <p>A considerable time after this was Writ, I was inform'd, That Sir <hi>William Davenant </hi>had made a Play on the same Story; I knew it not before, nor have I yet seen it: It was very unhappy for me to happen on the same Subject with so Ingenious a Person; I suppose no one will think me designedly guilty of such Confidence; that is a Vice, I hope I shall never be justly tax'd with; and yet I have now insensibly slid into it; for it does not argue greater assurance in one so weak as I am, to write after him, than to write to you. And therefore tho' I allow the Errors the Criticks may please to find in this Trifle, and tho' I slight no one's Opinion or Censures; yet they must excuse me, if I declare, I dread not those so much, as that your Grace will not Pardon this Presumption in, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>AS a Pale Virgin coyly do's refuse, </l>
        <l>To grant the Favour which she longs to lose; </l>
        <l>Faintly contending, that she may remove </l>
        <l>The actual Consummation of her Love; </l>
        <l>Fain wou'd she have her Dreams unridled to her, </l>
        <l>Yet bashfully resists him, that wou'd shew her: </l>
        <l>Seems to desire no farther Prosecution, </l>
        <l>Yet wishes for the Hour of Execution; </l>
        <l>At length she understands the full Intent, </l>
        <l>Partly by Rape, and partly by Consent. </l>
        <l>So this Day's Author between Hope and Fear, </l>
        <l>Hopes to succeed, yet trembles to appear. </l>
        <l>He struggl'd long against his Muse's force, </l>
        <l>(Jades are more headstrong, than a Well-bred Horse) </l>
        <l>His Phillis first, by Songs, he try'd to move, </l>
        <l>Two curst Diseases, Poetry and Love! </l>
        <l>And having once giv'n loose to her dull Rage, </l>
        <l>She now has Impudence to mount the Stage. </l>
        <l>Just so the Nymph, no more by Honor aw'd, </l>
        <l>She turns Pit-Whore, then Gallery, then Bawd. </l>
        <l>Too like are Poets to a common Whore, </l>
        <l>As being much despis'd, and very Poor. </l>
        <l>No better Evidence can I'm sure be found, </l>
        <l>Where there are some kind Masks, where Wits abound. </l>
        <l>How happy were't wou'd both leave off in time! </l>
        <l>Scribling and Loving quit, while in their Prime. </l>
        <l>But being pleas'd at first, they still go on, </l>
        <l>And never leave, till they are both undone. </l>
        <l>Till one is swing'd, and till the other's damn'd. </l>
        <l>Oh Jove avert from both what I have nam'd! </l>

        <head type="sub">Spoke by Miss Dennis Chock. </head>
        <l>OF all the Actors you have seen this day, </l>
        <l>Our Scribbler culls out me, t' excuse his Play, </l>
        <l>I cry'd I was too young; be said, he knew </l>
        <l>The likeliest way to please, was to be new. </l>
        <l>I cou'd not choose but laugh, to find the Fool </l>
        <l>Shou'd think Ine're was try'd, bred in this School: </l>
        <l>And therefore, to remove his gross mistake, </l>
        <l>I told I'd been us'd before to speak. </l>
        <l>But since I was't address to you, he swore, </l>
        <l>It was no fault, to have been us'd, Before. </l>
        <l>Tho he has taken after all wrong measure, </l>
        <l>Either to give the Men, or Ladies Pleasure. </l>
        <l>Gladly he wou'd divert yon beauteous Row; </l>
        <l>In vain he strives, for by my self I know, </l>
        <l>They hate, what they admir'd an hour ago. </l>
        <l>Yet, since they are not always of one mind, </l>
        <l>Some, at some minutes, may perhaps be kind. </l>
        <l>One tender look from them will please him more </l>
        <l>Than when the Pit applauds, or Gall'ries roar. </l>
        <l>And for the Men, I m told there was a time, </l>
        <l>When nothing mov'd like Virgins in their Prime. </l>
        <l>But Time alas is chang'd; now 'tis not so, </l>
        <l>Nothing will please the Beaux now, but a Beau. </l>
        <l>They come not now with Masks to keep a pother, </l>
        <l>But from Side-boxes ogle one another. </l>
        <l>But I forget for what I am come here. </l>
        <l>Well, 'tis not yet too late, because I hear, </l>
        <l>For all your forward boasts, you love the Rear. </l>
        <l>I come, to beg for Mercy for the Play, </l>
        <l>Yet do not think, I'll for your Judgment stay. </l>
        <l>No, I'll be gone, because such gen'rous Youths, </l>
        <l>When my Back's turn'd, will speak the kindest Truths. </l>
