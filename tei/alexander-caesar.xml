        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>AT that time when the Romans trauelled with an vnsatiable ambition to subdue all Nations, by whose ouerthrow they could conceaue any exspectation, either of glory, or profit: Caius Iulius Caesar, a man of a loftie minde, and giuen to attempt great things, ascending by seuerall degrees to the Consullship, procured a power to warre against the Gaules: amongst whom, after a number of admirable battels and victories (by the approbation of all the world; hauing purchased a singular reputation, both for his courage and skill in Armes) he being long accustomed to command, was so drunken with a delight of soueraigntie, that disdaining the simplicitie of a priuate life, he was so farre from denuding himselfe of the authoritie that he had, that altogether transported with a desire of more; hee sent to the Senate, to haue his gouernment of the Gaules, prorogated for fiue years which sute being repugnant to the Lawes, (as directly tending to tyrranie) was by the people publikely repelled. By which occasion, and some others, rising from an aemulation betweene him and Pompey the great, pretending a high indignation, hee incontinent crossed the Alpes, with such forces (though few) as he had in readinesse, and with a great celeritie came to Rome, which hee found abandoned by Pompey, in whom the Senate had reposed their trust, whom shortly after, by a memorable battell in the fields of Pharsalia he discomfited: and hauing by the ouerthrow of Scipio, death of Cato, and flight of Pompeys sonnes, <pb xml:id="ep000318-147-a"/>as it were, rooted out all the contrary faction, hee returned to Rome, and indirectly by the meanes of Antonius, laboured to be proclaimed king: which hauing rendred him altogether odious; Caius Cassius, Marcus Brutus, Decius Brutus, Publius Casca, and diuers others (Noble men) conspired his death, and appointed a day for the same: at which time, notwithstanding that Caesar was disswaded from going foorth, by many monstrous apparitions, and ominous presages; yet being perswaded by Decius Brutus Albinus, hee went towards the fatall place, where the Senate was assembled. </p>
        <p>The Conspirators in like maner, had many terrors amongst others, Portia the wife of Marcus, Brutus, although she had insinuated her selfe in her husbands secret, by a notable proofe of extraordinary magnanimitie, yet on the day dedicated for the execution of their designe, through the apprehension of his danger she fainted diuers times, whereof Brutus was aduertised, yet shrinked not, but went forward with his confederats to the appointed place, where they accomplished their purpose, euery one of them giuing Caesar a wound, and me a ground wherevpon to build this present Tragedie. </p>

                <l>Great Catoes mangled entrailes made them weepe, </l>
                <l>And desprate Scipio whilst he leap'd at last, </l>
                <l>To seeke a Sanctuarie amidst the depth. </l>
              </lg>

                <l>Then all those great men that in seuerall partes, </l>
                <l>Bent for Romes freedome Caesar did ouerthrow, </l>
                <l>Did by their pictures pierce the peoples harts, </l>
                <l>And made a pitteous (though a pompous) show. </l>

                <l>Whilst he that onely by their losse did gaine </l>
                <l>Of their calamitie but made a sport. </l>
              </lg>
              <lg>
                <l>But yet his purpose grieues them most of all, </l>
                <l>Since that he striues to be proclaimd a King, </l>
                <l>And not contents himselfe to make vs thrall, </l>
                <l>But to perpetuall bondage would vs bring. </l>

          <l>With raging accents and with dreadfull sounds, </l>
          <l>To draw dead Monarkes out of ruin'd herses, </l>
          <l>T'affright th'applauding world with bloudie wounds: </l>
          <l>Raze all the monuments of horrours past, </l>

        <lg>
          <l>And pardon (olde Heroes) for O I finde, </l>
          <l>I had no reason to admire your fates: </l>
          <l>And with rare guiftes of body and of minde, </l>
          <l>Th'vnbounded greatnesse of euill-conquerd states. </l>
          <l>More glorious actes then were atchieu'd by you, </l>

        <lg>
          <l>For yee the Potentates of former times, </l>
          <l>Making your will a right, your force a law: </l>
          <l>Staining your conquest with a thousand crimes, </l>
          <l>Still raign'd like tyrants but obey'd for awe: </l>
