        <head>The Printer to the Reader. </head>
        <p>IT hath bin an old saying, that vvhiles tvvo doggs do striue for a bone, the thirde may come and carie it avvay. And this prouerbe may (as I feare) be wel verefied in me which take in hand the imprinting of this poeticall Poesie. For the case seemeth doubtful, and I vvill disclose my coniecture. Master. H. VV. in the beginning of this worke, hath in his letter (vvritten to the Readers) cunningly discharged himselfe of any such misliking, as the grauer sort of grey heared iudgers mighte (perhaps) conceiue in the publicatiō of these pleasant Pamphlets. And nexte vnto that learned preamble, the letter of. G. T. (by vvhome as seemeth, the first coppie hereof vvas vnto the same. H. VV. deliuered, doth with no lesse clerkly cūning seeke to persvvade the readers, that he (also) vvoulde by no meanes haue it published. Novv I feare very muche (all these vvords notvvithstāding) that these tvvo gentlemen vvere of one assent compact to haue it imprinted: And yet, finding by experiēce that nothing is so vvel hādled nowadayes, but that some malicious minds may either take occasion to mislike it themselues, or else finde meanes to make it odious vnto others: They haue therefore (each of them) politiquely preuented the daunger of misreport, and suffered me the poore Printer to runne avvay vvith the palme of so perillous a victorie. Notwithstanding, hauing vvel perused the vvorke, I find nothing therein amisse (to my iudgemente) vnlesse it be tvvo or three vvanton places passed ouer in the discourse of an amorous enterprise: The vvhich for as much as the vvords <pb xml:id="ep000826-003-a"/>are cleanly (although the thing ment be somevvhat naturall) I haue thought good also to let them passe as they came to me, and the rather bicause (as master. H. VV. hath vvell alleadged in his letter to the Reader) the well minded mā may reape some commoditie out of the most friuolous vvorks that are vvritten. And as the venemous spider vvil sucke poison out of the most holesome herbe, and the industrious Bee can gather hony out of the most stinking vveede: Euen so the discrete reader may take a happie exāple by the most lasciuious histories, although the captious and harebraind heads can neither be encoraged by the good, nor forevvarned by the bad. And thus muche I haue thought good to say in excuse of some sauours, which may perchance smell vnpleasantly to some noses, in some part of this poeticall poesie. Novv it hath vvith this fault a greater commoditie than common poesies haue ben accustomed to present, and that is this, you shall not be constreined to smell of the floures therein cōteined all at once, neither yet to take them vp in such order as they are sorted: But you may take any one flowre by it selfe, and if that smell not so pleasantly as you vvold wish, I doubt not yet but you may find some other which may supplie the defects thereof. As thus, he vvhich wold haue good morall lessons clerkly handled, let him smell to the Tragedie translated out of Euripides. He that wold laugh at a prety conceit closely conueyed, let him peruse the comedie translated out of Ariosto. He that vvould take example by the vnlavvfull affections of a louer bestovved vppon an vnconstant dame, let them reade the report in verse, made by Dan Bartholmevv of Bathe, or the discourse in prose of the aduentures passed by master <pb xml:id="ep000826-003-b"/>F. I. vvhome the reader may name Freeman Iones, for the better vnderstanding of the same: he that vvould see any particuler pang of loue liuely displayed, may here approue euery Pamphlet by the title, and so remaine contented. As also diuers godly himnes and Psalmes may in like manner be founde in this recorde. To conclude, the worke is so vniuersall, as either in one place or other, any mans mind may therevvith be satisfied. The vvhich I aduenture (vnder pretext of this promise) to present vnto all indifferent eyes as follovveth. </p>

          <hi>IN August last </hi>passed my familiar friend Master <hi>G. T. </hi>bestowed vppon me the reading of a written Booke, wherin he had collected diuers discourses &amp; verses, inuented vppon sundrie occasions, by sundrie gentlemē (in mine opinion) right commendable for their capacitie. And herewithal my said friend charged me, that I should vse them onely for mine owne particuler commoditie, and eftsones safely deliuer the originall copie to him againe, wherein I must confesse my selfe but halfe a marchant, for the copie vnt● him I haue safely redeliuered. But the worke (for I thought it worthy to be publilished) I haue entreated my friend <hi>A. B. </hi>to emprint: as one that thought better to please a number by common commoditie then to féede the humor of any priuate parson by nedelesse singularitie. This I haue aduentured, for thy contentation (learned Reader.) And further haue presumed of my selfe to christen it by the name of <hi>A hundreth sundrie Flowers</hi>: In which poeticall posie are set forth manie trifling fantasies, humorall passions, and straunge affects of a Louer. And therin (although the wiser sort wold turne ouer the leafe as a thing altogether fruitlesse) yet I my selfe haue reaped this commoditie, to sit and smile at the fond deuises of such as haue enchayned them selues in the golden fetters of fantasie, and hauing bewrayed them <pb n="202" xml:id="ep000826-084-a"/>selues to the whole world, do yet coniecture that they walke vnséene in a net. Some other things you may also finde in this Booke, which are as voyde of vanitie, as the first are lame for gouernement. And I must confesse that (what to laugh at the one, &amp; what to learne by the other) I haue contrary to the chardge of my said friend <hi>G. T. </hi>procured for these trifles this day of publication. Wherat if the aucthors onely repyne, and the number of other learned mindes be thankfull: I may then boast to haue gained a bushell of good will, in exchange for one pynt of péeuish choler. But if it fal out contrary to expectatiō that the readers iudgements agrée not with myne opinion in their commendacions, I may then (vnlesse their curtesies supplie my want of discretion) with losse of some labour, accompt also the losse of my familier friendes, in doubt whereof, I couer all our names, and referre you to the well written letter of my friende <hi>G. T. </hi>next following, whereby you may more at large consider of these occasions. And so I cōmend the praise of other mens trauailes together with the pardon of mine owne rashnes, vnto the well willing minds of discrete readers.

            <head>The letter of G. T. to his very friend H. W. concerning this worke. </head>
            <p>REmembring the late conference passed betwene vs in my lodging, and how you séemed to estéeme some Pamphlets, which I did there shew vnto you farre aboue their worth in skill, I do straightwaye conclude the same your iudgment to procede of two especiall causes, one (and principall) the stedfast good will, which you haue euer hitherto sithens our first <pb n="203" xml:id="ep000826-084-b"/>familiaritie borne towardes mée. An other (of no lesse weight) the exceding zeale and fauour that you beare to good letters. The which (I agrée with you) do no lesse bloome and appeare in plea●aunt ditties or compendious Sonets, deuised by gréen youthful capacities, than they do fruitefully florish vnto perfection in the ryper workes of graue and grayheared writers. For as in the last, the yonger sort maye make a mirror of perfecte life: so in the first, the most frosty bearded Philosopher, maye take iust occasion of honest recreation, not altogether without holsome lessons, tending to the reformation of manners. For who doubteth but that Poets in their most feyned fables and imaginations, haue metaphorically set forth vnto vs the right rewardes of vertues, and the due punnishments for vices? Marie in déede I may not compare Pamphlets vnto Poems, neither yet may iustly aduant for our natiue countrimen, that they haue in their verses hitherto (translations excepted) deliuered vnto vs any such notable volume, as haue bene by Poets of antiquitie, left vnto the posteritie. And the more pitie, that amongst so many toward wittes no one hath bene hitherto encouraged to followe the trace of that worthy and famous Knight <hi>Sir Geffrey Chaucer</hi>, and after many pretie deuises spent in youth, for the obtayning a worthles victorie, might consume and consummate his age in discribing the right pathway to perfect felicitie, with the due preseruation of the same. The which although some may iudge ouer graue a subiect to be handled in stile metrical, yet for that I haue found in the verses of eloquent Latinists, learned Gréekes, &amp; pleasant <hi>Italians▪ </hi>sundrie directions, whereby a man may be guided toward thattayning of that vnspeakeable treasure, I haue thus farre lamented, that our countreymen, haue chosen rather to winne a passouer praise by the wanton penning of a few louing layes, than to gayne immortall fame, by the Clarkely <pb n="204" xml:id="ep000826-085-a"/>handlinge of so profitable a Theame. For if quicknes of inuencion, proper vocables, apt Epythetes, and store of monasillables may help a pleasant brayne to be crowned with Lawrell. I doubt not but both our countreymen &amp; coun●rie language might be entronised amonge the olde foreleaders vnto the mount Helicon. But nowe let mée returne to my first purpose, for I haue wandred somwhat beside the path, and yet not cleane out of the way. I haue thoug●t good (I say) to present you with this writtē booke, wherein you shall find a number of <hi>Sonets▪ </hi>layes, letters, Ballades, Rondlets, verlayes and verses, the workes of your friend and myne Master <hi>F. I. </hi>and diuers others, the which when I had with long trauayle confusedly gathered together, I thought it then <foreign xml:lang="lat">Opere precium</foreign>, to reduce them into some good order. The which I haue done according to my barreyne skill in this written Booke, commending it vnto you to read and to peruse, and desiring you as I onely do aduenture thus to participate the sight therof vnto your former good will, euen so that you will by no meanes make the same common: but after your owne recreation taken therin that you wil safely redeliuer vnto me the originall copie. For otherwise I shall not onely prouoke all the aucthors to be offended with mée, but further shall léese the opertunitie of a greater matter, halfe and more graunted vnto mée alreadie, by the willing consent of one of them. And to be playne (with you my friend) he hath written (which as farre as I can learne) did neuer yet come to the reading or perusinge of any man but himselfe: two notable workes. The one called, the <hi>Sundry lots of loue</hi>. The other of his owne inuencion entituled. <hi>The clyming of an Eagles neast. </hi>These thinges (and especially the later) doth séeme by the name to be a work worthy the reading. And the rather I iudge so because his fantasie is so occupied in the same, as that contrary to his wonted vse, he hath hitherto withhelde <pb n="205" xml:id="ep000826-085-b"/>it from sight of any his fa●iliers, vntill it be finished, you may gesse him by his Nature. And therfore I requier your secresie herein, least if he hear the contrary, we shall not be able by any meanes to procure these other at his handes. So fare you wel, </p>

        <p>WHen I had with no small entreatie obteyned of Master <hi>F.

        <p>I Haue heard the Aucthor saye, that these were the first verses that euer he wrote vppon like occasion. The which cōsidering the matter precedent, may in my iudgement be well allowed, and to iudge his doings by the effectes he declared vnto me, that before he coulde put the same in legible writinge, it pleased the sayd Mystresse Elinor of hir curtesie thus to deale with him.

        <p>MY friend <hi>F. I. </hi>hath tolde me diuers times, that imediatly vppon receit hereof, he grew in ielosy, that the same was not her owne deuise. And ther in I haue no lesse allowed his iudgment, then cōmended his inuention of the verses, and letters before rehersed. For as by the stile this letter of hirs bewrayeth that it was not penned by a womans capacitie, so the sequell of hir doings may discipher, that she had me ready clearkes then trustie seruants in store. Well yet as the perfect hound, when he hath chased the hurt deere, amidde the whole heard, wil neuer giue ouer till he haue singled it againe. Euen so <hi>F.

Wherfore he thought not best to commit the sayde verses willingly into hir custodie, but priuily lost them in hir chamber, written in counterfeit.

            <p>THE much that you haue answered is very much, and much more than I am able to replye vnto: neuerthelesse in myne owne defence, thus I alleage: that if my sodein departure pleased not you, I cannot my selfe therwith be pleased, as one that seeketh not to please many, and more disirous to please you then any. The cause of myne affection, I suppose you behold dayly. For (self loue auoyded) euery wight may iudge of themselues as much as reason perswadeth: the which if it be in your good nature suppressed with bashfulnes, then mighty loue graunt, you may once behold my wan cheekes wasshed in woe, that therein my salt teares may be a myrrour to represent your owne shadow, and that like vnto Narcissus you may bee constrayned to kisse the cold waues, wherein your coūterfait is so liuely portrayed. For if aboundance of other matters fayled to drawe my gazing eyes in contemplacion of so rare excellency, yet might these your letters both frame in me an admiration of such diuine esprit, and a confusion to my dull vnderstanding, which so rashly presumed to wander in this endles Laberinthe.

        <p>THis letter finished and fayre written ouer, his chaūce was to méete hir alone in a Gallery of the same house: where (as I haue heard him declare) his manhood in this <pb n="210" xml:id="ep000826-088-a"/>kind of combat was first tryed, and therein I can compare him to a valiant Prince, who distressed with power of enemies had committed the safegard of his person to treaty of Ambassade, and sodenly (surprised with a Camnassado in his own trenches) was enforced toyéeld as prisoner. Euen so my friend F.I. lately ouercome by the beautifull beames of this Dame Elynor, and hauing now cōmitted his most secrete intent to these late rehearsed letters, was at vnwares encountred with his friendly foe, and constrayned either to prepare some new defence, or else like a recreant to yéeld himself as already vāquished. Wherfore (as in a traunce) he lifted vp his dazled eyes, &amp; so continued in a certen kind of admiration, not vnlike the Astronomer, who (hauing after a whole nights trauayle, in grey morning found his desired starre) hath fixed his hungry eies to behold the Comete long looked for: wherat this gracious Dame (as one that could discerne the sun before hir chāber windowes were wide opē) did deign to embolden the feinting with these or like words. </p>
        <p>I perceiue now (quod she) how mishap doth follow me, that hauing chosen this walke for a simple solace, I am here disquieted by the man that meaneth my distructiō▪ &amp; therwithal, as half angry, began to turne hir back, when as my friend F.I. now awaked, gan thus salute hir. </p>
        <p>Mystres (quod he) and I perceiue now, that good hap haūts me, for being by lack of oportunitie constreined to cōmit my welfare vnto these blabbing leaues of bewraying pape (shewing that in his hand) I am here recōforted with happy view of my desired ioye, &amp; therewithall reuerētly kissing his hand, did softly distreine hir slender arme &amp; so stayed hir departure. The first blow thus profered &amp; defended, they walked &amp; talked trauersing diuers wayes, wherein I doubt not but that my friend. F.I. could quit himself resonably well. And though it stood not with duty of a friend that I should therin require to know hir secrets, yet of <pb n="211" xml:id="ep000826-088-b"/>him self he declared thus much, that after long talke shée was contented to accept his proferd seruice, but yet still disabling hir self, and séeming to maruell what cause had moued him to subiect his libertie so wilfully, or at least in a prison (as she termed it) so vnworthy. Whereunto I néede not rehearse his answere, but suppose now, that thus they departed: sauing I had forgotten this, shée required of him the last rehearsed letter, saying that his frist was lost, &amp; now she lacked a new bottome for hir silke, the which I warrāt you, he graūted: and so profering to take an humble congé by <hi>Bezo las manos</hi>, shée graciously gaue him the <hi>zuccado dez labros</hi>: and so for then departed. And therupō recōpting hir words, he cōpyled these following, which he termed <hi>Terza sequenza</hi>, to swéet Mystres SHE. </p>

At which newes <hi>F. I. </hi>tooke small comfort: neuerthelesse Dame Venus with good aspect dyd yet thus much furder his enterprise. The Dame (whether it were by sodain chaunge, or of wonted custome) fell one day into a great bléeding at the nose. For which accident the said <hi>F. I. </hi>amongst other prety cōceits, hath a present remedy, wherby he tooke occasion (when they of the house had all in vayne sought many ways to stop hir bléeding) to worke his feate in this wyse: First he pleaded ignorance, as though he knewe not hir name, and therefore demaunded the same of one other Gentlewomā in the house, whose name was Mistres Frances, who when shée had to him declared that hir name was Elinor, hée said these wordes or very lyke in effect: If I thought I should not offend Mystres Elynor, I would not doubt to stop hir bléeding, without eyther payne or difficulty. This gentlewoman somewhat tyckled wyth hys words, did incontinent make relacion thereof to the sayd Mystres Elynor, who immediately (declaring that <hi>F. I. </hi>was hir late receyued seruaunt) returned the sayd messanger vnto him with especiall charge, that hée shoulde employ his de●oyre towards the recouery of hir health, with whom the same <hi>F. I. </hi>repayred to the chamber of his desired: and finding hir sette in a chayre, leaning on the one side ouer a siluer bason: After his due reuereuce, hée layd his hand on hir temples, and priuily rounding hir in hir eare, desired hir to commaund a Hazell sticke and a knyfe: the which being brought, hée deliuered vnto hir, saying on this wyse. Mystres I wil speak certen words in secret to my selfe, and doe require no more: but when you heare me saie openly this word Amen, that you with this knyfe will make a nycke vppon this hasell stycke: and when you haue made fyue nickes, commaunde mée also to cease. The Dame partly of good wil to the knight, and partly to be stenched of hir bléeding, commaunded <pb n="214" xml:id="ep000826-090-a"/>hir mayd, and required the other gentils, somewhat to stand asyde, which done, he began his oraisons, wherein he had not long muttered before he pronounced Amen, wherewith the Lady made a nyck on the stick with hir knyfe. The said <hi>F. I. </hi>continued to an other Amen, when the Lady hauing made an other nyck felt hir bléeding, began to steynch: and so by the third Amen throughly steinched. <hi>F. I. </hi>then chaunging his prayers into priuate talk, said softly vnto hir. Mystres, I am glad that I am hereby enabled to do you some seruice, and as the staunching of your own bloud may some way recōfort you, so if the shedding of my bloud may any way content you, I beséech you commaund it, for it shalbe euermore readily employed in your seruice, and therwithal with a loud voyce pronounced Amen: wherwith the good Lady making a nyck did secretly answere thus. Good seruaunt (quod shée) I must néeds think my self right happy to haue gained your seruice and good will, and be you sure, that although ther be in me no such desert as may draw you into this depth of affection, yet such as I am, I shalbe alwayes glad to shewe my self thankfull vnto you, and now, if you think your self assured, that I shall bléede no more, doe thē prononce your fifth Amen, the which pronounced, shée made also hir fifth nicke, and held vp hir head, calling the company vnto hir, and declaring vnto them, that hir bléeding was throughly steinched. Well, it were long to tell, what sundry opinions were pronounced vpon this acte, and I doe dwell ouerlong in the discourses of this <hi>F. I. </hi>especially hauing taken in hand only to copie out his verses, but for the circumstāce doth better declare the effect, I will returne to my former tale. <hi>F. I. </hi>tarying a while in the chamber found oportunitie to loose his sequence néere to his desired Mistres: And after congé taken departed. After whose departuer the Lady arose out of hir chayre, &amp; hir mayd going about to remoue the same, espied, &amp; tooke <pb n="215" xml:id="ep000826-090-b"/>vp the writing: the which hir mistres perceiuing, gan sodenly cōiecture that the same had in it some like matter to the verses once before left in like maner, &amp; made semblāt to mistrust that the same shuld be some words of cōiuration: and taking it frō hir mayd, did peruse it, &amp; immediatly said to the cōpany, that she would not forgo the same for a great treasure. But to be plain, I think that (<hi>F. I. </hi>excepted) she was glad to be rid of all cōpany, vntill shée had with sufficient leasure turned ouer &amp; retossed euery card in this sequēce. And not long after being now tickled thorough all the vaines with an vnknown humour, aduentured of hir self to cōmit vnto a like Ambassadour the discyphring of that which hitherto she had kept more secret, &amp; therupō wrot with hir own hand &amp; head in this wyse. </p>

        <p>THis letter I haue séene, of hir own hand writing: and as therin the Reader may finde great difference of Style, from hir former letter, so may you nowe vnderstand the casue. Shée had in the same house a friend, a seruaunt, a Secretary: what should I name him? such one as shée estéemed in time past more than was cause in tyme present, and to make my tale good, I will (by report of my very good friend <hi>F. I.</hi>) discribe him vnto you. Hée was in height, the proportion of twoo <pb n="216" xml:id="ep000826-091-a"/>Pigmeys, in bredth the thicknesse of two bacon hogges, of presumption a Gyant, of power a Gnat, Apishly wytted, Knauishly mannerd, &amp; crabbedly fauord, what was there in him then to drawe a fayre Ladies liking? Marry sir euen all in all, a well lyned pursse, wherwith he could at euery call, prouide such pretie conceytes as pleased hir péeuish fantasie, and by that meanes he had throughly (long before) insinuated him selfe with this amorous dame. This manling, this minion, this slaue, this secretary, was nowe by occasion rydden to London forsothe: and though his absence were vnto hir a disfurnishing of eloquence: it was yet vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>an opertunitie of good aduaūtage, for when he perceiued the change of hir stile, and therby grew in some suspicion that the same proceded by absence of hir chiefe Chauncellor, he thought good now to smyte while the yron was hotte, and to lend his Mistresse such a penne in hir Secretaries absence, as he should neuer be able at his returne to amende the well writing thereof, wherfore according to hir commaund he repayred once euery daye to hir chamber, at the least, whereas he guided him selfe so wel, and could deuise such store of sundry pleasure and pastymes, that he grew in fauour not onely with his desired, but also with the rest of the gentlewomen. And one daye passing the time amongst them, their playe grew to this end, that his Mistresse, being Quéene, demaunded of him these thrée questions. Seruaunt (quod she) I charge you, aswell vppon your allegiance being nowe my subiect, as also vppon your fidelitie, hauing vowed your seruice vnto mée that you aunswere me these thrée questions, by the very truth of your secret thought. First, what thing in this vniuersall world doth most reioyce and comforte you? <hi>F. I. </hi>abasing his eyes towardes the ground, toke good aduisement in his aunswere, when a fayre gentlewoman of the company clapped him on the shoulder, saying, how <pb n="217" xml:id="ep000826-091-b"/>now sir, is your hād on your halfpeny? To whom he aunswered, no fayre Lady, my hand is on my harte, and yet my hart is not in myne owne handes: wherewithall abashed turning towardes dame Elinor he sayed. My souereigne &amp; Mistresse, according to the charge of your commaund, and the dutie that I owe you, my tongue shal bewraye vnto you the truth of myne intent. At this present a rewarde giuen me without desert▪ doth so reioyce mée with continuall remembraunce therof, that though my mind be so occupied to thinke thereon, as that daye nor night I can be quiet from that thought, yet the ioye and pleasure which I conceiue in the same is such, that I can neither be cloyed with continuaunce therof, nor yet afrayde, that any mishap can counteruayle so great a treasure. This is to me such a heauen to dwell in, as that I féede by day, and repose by night, vpon the fresh record of this reward, this (as he sayeth) he ment by the kysse that she lent him in the Gallery, and by the profession of hir last letters and wordes. Well, though this aunswere be somewhat mistie, yet let my friendes excuse be: that taken vppon the sodeyne he thought better to aunswere darkely, then to be mistrusted openly. Hir second questiō was, what thing in this life did moste greue his harte, and disquiet his mind, whereunto he answered. That although his late rehersed ioye were incomparable, yet the greatest enimie that disturbed the same, was the priuie worme of his owne giltie conscience, which accused him euermore with great vnworthinesse: and that this was his greatest grief. The Lady byting vppon the bit at his cunning answeres made vnto these two questions, gan thus replie, Seruant, I had thought to haue touched you yet nearer with my third question, but I will refrayne to attempt your pacience: and now for my third demaūd, aunswere me directly in what manner this passion doth handle you? and howe these contraries maye hang together <pb n="218" xml:id="ep000826-092-a"/>by any possibilitie of concorde? for your wordes are strauunge. <hi>F. I. </hi>now rowsing him selfe boldly toke occasion thus to handle his aunswere. Mistresse (quod he) my wordes in dede are straunge, but yet my possion is is much straunger, and theruppon this other day to content mine owne fātasie I deuised a Sonet, which although it be a péece of Cocklorells musicke, and such as I might be ashamed to publish in this company, yet because my truth in this aunswere may the better appeare vnto you, I pray you vouchsafe to receiue the same in writing: and drawing a paper out of his packet presented it vnto hir, wherin was written this Sonet. </p>

        <p>THis Sonet was highly commended, and in my iudgement it deserueth no lesse, I haue heard <hi>F. I. </hi>saye, that he borowed th'inuentiun of an Italian: but were it a translation or inuention (if I be Iudge) it is both prety and pithy. His dutie thus perfourmed, their pastimes ended, <pb n="219" xml:id="ep000826-092-b"/>and at their departure for a watch worde hée counselled his Mistresse by little and little to walke abrodesayinge that the Gallery neare adioyning was so pleasaunt, as if he were halfe dead hée thought that by walking therin he might bée halfe and more reuiued. Think● you so seruaunt (quod she?) and the last tyme that I walked there I suppose I toke the cause of my mallady, but by your aduise (and for you haue ●o clerkly steynched my bleeding) I will assaye to walke there to morow. Mistres quod he, and in more ful accomplishment of my duetie towards you, and in sure hope that you wil vse the same one lie to your owne priuate cōmoditie, wil there awaite vppon you, &amp; betwene you &amp; me wil teach you the ful order how to steynch the bléeding of any creature, wherby you shall be as cuning as my selfe. Gramercy good seruaunt, <abbr>qd </abbr>she, I thinke you lost the same in writing here yesterday, but I cannot vnderstand it, and therfore to morrowe (if I féele my selfe any thing amended) I wil send for you thither to enstruct me throughly: thus they departed. And at supper time, the Knight of the Castel finding fault that his gestes stomacke serued him no better, began to accuse the gro●enes of his vyands, to whom one of the gentlewomen which had passed the afternoone in his company, aunswered. Nay sir <abbr>qd </abbr>she, this gentleman hath a passiō, the which once once in a daye at the least doth kill his appetite. Are you so well acquainted with the disposition of his body <abbr>qd </abbr>the Lord of the house? by his owne saying, <abbr>qd </abbr>she, &amp; not otherwise. Fayre Ladie <abbr>qd </abbr>
          <hi>F. I. </hi>you either mistoke me or ouerheard me then, for I told of a comfortable humor which so ●ed me with continual remēbrance of ioye, as that my stomack being ful therof doth desire in maner none other vittayles. Why sir, <abbr>qd </abbr>the host, do you then liue by loue? God forbid Sir quod <hi>F. I. </hi>for then my chéekes wold be much thinner then they be, but there are diuers other greater causes of ioy, then the doubtful lottes <pb n="220" xml:id="ep000826-093-a"/>of loue, and for myne owne part, to be playne, I cannot loue, and I dare not hate. I would I thought so, quod the gentlewoman. And thus with prety nyppes, they passed ouer their supper: which ended, the Lord of the house require● <hi>F. I. </hi>to daunce and passe the tyme with the gentlewoman, which he refused not to doe. But sodenly, before the musicke was well tuned, came out Dame Elynor in hir night attyre, and said to the Lord, that (supposing the solitarinesse of hir chāber had encreased hir maladie) she came out for hir better recreaciō to sée them daūce, Wel done daughter (quod the Lord.) And I Mistres (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) would gladly bestowe the leading of you about this great chamber, to dryue away the fayntnesse of your feuer. No good seruaunt, quod the Lady, but in my stéede, I pray you daunce with this fayre Gentlewoman, pointing him to the Lady that had so taken him vp at supper. <hi>F. I. </hi>to auoyde mistrust, did agrée to hir request without furder entreaty. The daunce begon, this Knight marched on with the Image of S. Fraunces in his hand, and S. Elynor in his hart. The violands at ende of the pauion staied a whyle: in which time this Dame sayde to <hi>F. I. </hi>on this wyse. I am right sorry for you in two respects, although the familiarity haue hytherto had no great continuance betwene vs: and as I do lament your case, so doo I reioyce (for myne own contentation) that I shall now sée a due triall of the experiment which I haue long desired. This sayd, she kept silence. When <hi>F. I. </hi>(somewhat astonied with hir straunge spéeche) thus aunswered: Mystres although I cannot conceyue the meaning of your wordes, yet by curtesy I am constrayned to yeelde you thankes for your good will, the which appeareth no lesse in lamenting of mishaps, than in reioycing at good fortune. What experiment you meane to trye by mée, I know not, but I dare assure you, that my skill in experiments is very simple. Herewith the Instruments sounded <pb n="221" xml:id="ep000826-093-b"/>a new Measure, and they passed forthwardes leauing to talke, vntill the noyse ceassed: which done, the gentlewoman replied. I am sory sir, that you did erewhile, denie loue and all his lawes, and that in so open audience. Not so quod <hi>F. I. </hi>but as the word was roundly taken, so can I readely aunswere it by good reason. Wel quod she, how if the hearers will admit no reasonable aunswere? My reason shall yet be neuerthelesse (quod he) in reasonable iudgement. Herewith she smyled, and he cast a glance towardes dame Elinor askances art thou pleased? Againe the vyols called them forthwardes, and againe at the end of the braule sayd <hi>F. I. </hi>to this gentlewoman: I pray you Mistres, and what may be the second cause of your sorow sustained in my behalfe? Nay soft quod she, percase I haue not yet told you the first, but content your selfe, for the second cause you shall neuer know at my handes, vntill I sée due trial of the experiment which I haue long desired. Why then (quod she) I can but wish a present occasion to bring the same to effect, to the end that I might also vnderstād the mistery of your meaning. And so might you fail of your purpose (quod she) for I meane to be better assured of him that shall know the depth of mine intent in such a secrete, than I do suppose that any creature (one except) may be of you. Gentlewomā (quod he) you speak Greeke, the which I haue now forgotten, and myne instructers are to farre from mée at this present to expound your words. Or els to neare (quod she) and so smiling stayed hir talke, when the musick called them to another daūce. Which ended, <hi>F. I. </hi>halfe afrayd of false suspect, and more amazed at this straunge talke, gaue ouer, and bringing Mistresse Fraunces to hir place was thus saluted by his Mistresse. Seruaunt (quod she) I hadde done you great wrong to haue daunced with you, con●●dering that this gentlewoman and you had former occasion of so waighty conference. Mistresse sayd <hi>F. I. </hi>you had done mée great <pb n="222" xml:id="ep000826-094-a"/>pleasure, for by our conference I haue but brought my braynes in a busie coniecture. I doubt not (sayd his Mistresse) but you wil end that busines easely. It is hard said <hi>F. I. </hi>to end the thing, wherof yet I haue founde no beginning. His Mistresse with change of countenaunce kept silence, whereat dame Fraunces reioycing, cast out this bone to gnawe on. I perceyue (quod she) it is euill to halt before a Creple. <hi>F. I. </hi>perceyuing now that his Mistresse waxed angry thought good on hir behalfe thus to aunswere: and it is euill to hop before them that runne for the Bell: his Mistresse replied, and it is euill to hang the Bell at their héeles which are alwayes running. The L. of he Castle ouerhearing these proper quippes, rose out of his chayre, and comming towards <hi>F. I. </hi>required him to daunce a Gallyard. Sir sayd <hi>F. I. </hi>I haue hitherto at your apoyntment but walked about the house, now if you be desirous to sée one tomble a turne or twayne, it is like ynough that I might prouoke you to laugh at mée, but in good faith my dauncing dayes are almost done, and therfore sir (quod he) I pray you speake to them that are more nymble at tripping on the toe. Whilest hée was thus saying dame Elynor had made hir Congey, and was now entring the doore of hir chamber: when <hi>F. I. </hi>all amazed at hir sodeyne departure followed to take leaue of his Mistresse: but she more then angrie, refused to heare his good night, and entring hir chamber caused hir mayde to clappe the doore. <hi>F. I. </hi>with heauie cheare returned to his company, and Mistresse Fraunces to toutch his sore with a corosiue sayd to him softly in this wise. Sir you may now perceyue that this our countrie cannot allowe the French maner of dauncing, for they (as I haue heard tell) do more commonly daunce to talke, then entreate to daunce. <hi>F. I. </hi>hoping to driue out one nayle with another, and thinking this a meane most conuenient to suppresse all ielous supposes, toke Mistresse Fraunces by the hand● <pb n="223" xml:id="ep000826-094-b"/>and with a heauie smyle aunswered. Mistresse and I (because I haue séene the french maner of dauncing) will eftsones entreat you to daunce a Bargynet: what meane you by this quod Mistresse Fraunces. If it please you to followe (quod he) you shall sée that I can iest without ioye, and laugh without lust, and calling the musitions, caused them softly to sound the Tyntarnell, when he clearing his voyce did <hi>Alla Napolitana </hi>applie these verses following, vnto the measure. </p>

        <p>THese verses are more in number than do stand with contentation of some iudgements, and yit the occasiō throughly considered, I can commend them with the rest, for it is (as may be well fermed) <hi>continua or at ●o▪ </hi>declaring a full discourse of his first loue: wherin (ouer and besides that the Epythetes are aptly applied, &amp; the verse of it self pleasant enough) I note that by it he ment in cloudes to discipher vnto Mistres Fraunces such matter as she wold snatch at, and yit could take no good hold of the same. Furthermore, it aunswered very aptly to the note which the musike sounded, as the skilfull reader by due triall may approue. This singing daunce, or daunsing song ended, Mistres Fraunces giuing due thanks, séemed weary also of the company, and profering to departe, gaue yit this farewell to <hi>F. I. </hi>not vexed by choller, but pleased with contentation, and called away by heauy sléepe: I am constreyned (quod she) to bid you good night, and so turning to the rest of the company, tooke hir leaue. Then the Maister of the house commaunded a torch to light <hi>F. I. </hi>to his lodging, where (as I haue heard him saye) the sodeyn chaunge of his Mistres countenance, togither with the straungenes of Mistresse Fraunces talke, made such an encounter in his mynde, that he could take no reste that night: wherefore in the morning rysing very earely (although it were farre before his mistres hower) he rooled his choller by walking in the Gallery neare to hir lodging, and there in this passion compyled these vers●s following. </p>

        <p>THis is but a rough 〈◊〉, and reason, for it was deuised in great disquiet of mynd, and written 〈◊〉 rage, yet haue I séene much worse passe the mustors, yea and where both the Lieutenant and Prouost Marshall were 〈◊〉 of rype iudgement: and as it is, I pray you 〈…〉 here, for the truth is that <hi>F. I. </hi>himselfe had so 〈…〉 therin, that he neuer presented it, but to the matter. Whē he had long (and all in vayn) looked for the cōming of his Mistres into hir appointed walk: he wandred into the park néere adioyning to the Castle wall; where his chaunce was to méete Mistresse Fraunces, accompanied with one other Gentlewoman, by whom he passed with a reuerēce <pb n="227" xml:id="ep000826-096-b"/>of curtesie: and so walking on, came into the side of a thicket▪ where he sat down vnder a trée to allay his sadnesse with solitarines. Mistres Fraunces, partly of curtesie and affection, and partly to content hir mind by continuance of such talk as thei had commenced ouer night, entreated hir companion to goe with hir vnto this trée of reformacion, whereas they found the Knight with his armes vnfolded in a heauy kind of contemplation, vnto whom Mistres Fraunces stepped apace, (right softly) &amp; at vnwares gaue this salutation. I little thought Syr Knight (quod she) by your euensong yesternight, to haue found you presently at such a morrow masse, but I perceiue you serue your Saint with double deuotion: and I pray God graūt you treble méede for your true intent. <hi>F. I. </hi>taken thus vpon the sodeine, could none otherwise answer but thus: I told you Mistresse (quod he) that I could laughe without lu●●, and iest without ioye: and there withall starting vp, with a more bolde countenance came towardes the Dames, profering vnto them his seruice, to wayte vpon thē homewards. I haue heard say oft times (<abbr>qd </abbr>Mistres Fraunces) that it is hard to serue two Maisters at one time, but we wilbe right glad of your company. I thank you (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) and so walking on with them, fell into sundry discourses, still refusing to touch any part of their former communicacion, vntill Mistresse Frauuces sayd vnto him: by my troth (quod thée) I would bee your debtour these two dayes, to aunswer me truely but vnto one question that I will propound: fayre Gentlewoman (quod hée) you shall not neede to becomme my debtour, but if it please you to quit question by questiō, I wil be more ready to gratifie you in this request, than either reason requireth, or than you would be willing to worke my cōtentatiō. Master <hi>F. I. </hi>(<abbr>qd </abbr>she, &amp; that sadly) peraduētur you know but a litle how willing I would be to procure <pb n="228" xml:id="ep000826-097-a"/>your contentation, but you know that hitherto familiaritie hath taken no déepe roote betwixt vs twayne. And though I find in you no maner of cause whereby I might doubt to commit this or greater matter vnto you, yit haue I stayed hitherto so to doe, in doubt least you might thereby iustly condempne mée both of arrogancy and lack of discretion, wherwith I must yit foolishly affirm, that I haue with great payne brydeled my tonge from disclosing the same vnto you. Such is then the good will that I beare towards you, the which if you rather iudge to bée impudencie, than a friendly meaning, I may then curse the hower that I first concluded thue to deale with you: herewithall being now red for chaste bashefulnesse, shée abased hir eyes, and stayed hir talke, to whom <hi>F. I. </hi>thus aunswered. Mistresse Fraunces, if I should with so excéeding villanie requite such and so excéeding courtesie, I might not onely séeme to digenerate from all gentry, but also to differ in behauiour from all the rest of my lyfe spent: wherefore to be playne with you in few wordes, I thinke my selfe so much bound vnto you for diuers respects, as if abilitie doe not fayle mée, you shall fynde mée myndfull in requitall of the same: and for disclosing your mind to mée, you may if so please you aduenture it without aduenture, for by this Sunne, quod hée, I will not deceyue such trust as you shall lay vppon mée, and furthermore, so farre foorth as I may, I wilbe yours in any respect: wherfore I beséech you accept me for your faithfull friend, and so shall you surely find mée. Not so, quod shée, but you shalbe my Trust, if you vouchsafe the name, and I wilbe to you as you shall please to terme mée: my H●pe (quod hée) if you so be pleased and: thus agreed, they two walked a parte from the other Gentlewoman, and fell into sad talke, wherein Mistresse Fraunces dyd very curteousely declare vnto him, that in déed, one cause of <pb n="229" xml:id="ep000826-097-b"/>hir sorrow susteyned in his behalfe, was that he had sayd so openly ouer night, that hée could not loue, for shée perceyued very well the affection betwéene him and Madame Elynor, and she was also aduertised that Dame Elynor stood in the portall of hir chamber, harkening to the talke that they had at supper that night, wherefore she séemed to be sory that such a woord (rashely escaped) might become great hinderaunce vnto his desire: but a greater cause of hir grief was (as she declared) that hys hap was to bestowe his lyking so vnworthely, for shee séemed to accuse Dame Elynor, for the most vnconstant woman lyuing: In full profe whereof, she bewrayed vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>how she the same Dame Elynor, had of long time ben yéelded to the Mynion Secretary, whom I haue before described: in whom though there bee (quod shée) no one point of worthynesse, yit shameth she not to vse him as h●●●ea●est friend, or rather hir holyest Idoll, and that this not withstanding Dame Elynor had bene also sundry tymes woone to choyce of chaunge, as she named vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>two Gentlemen whereof the one was named <hi>H. D. </hi>and that other <hi>H. K. </hi>by whom shee was during sundry tymes of their seuerall aboad in those parties, entreated to like ●urteousie, for these causes the Dame Fraunces séemed to mislike <hi>F. I. </hi>choice, and to lament that she doubted in processe of time to sée him abused. The experiment she ment was this, for that she thought <hi>F. I. </hi>(I vse hir wordes) a man in euery respect very woorthy to haue the seuerall vse of a more commodious common, she hoped nowe to sée if his enclosure thereof might be defensible against hir sayd Secretary, and such like. These things and diuers other of great importance, this courteouse Lady Fraunces did friendly disclose vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>and furthermore, did both instruct and aduise him how to procéede in his enterprise. Now to make my talke good, and least the Reader might bee drawen in a <pb n="230" xml:id="ep000826-098-a"/>ielouse suppose of this Lady Fraunces; I must let you vnderstand that shée was vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>a kinswoman, a virgin of rare chastitie, singular capacitie, notable modestie, and excellent beauty: and though <hi>F. I. </hi>had cast his affection on the other (being a married woman) yit was ther in their beauties no great difference: but in all other good giftes a wonderfull diuersitie, as much as might be betwene constancie &amp; ●litting fantasie, betwene womāly coūtenance &amp; girlish garishnes, betwene hot dissimulacion &amp; temperate fidelitie. Now if any man will curiously aske the question why <hi>F. I. </hi>should chuse the one and leaue the other, ouer and besides the cōmon prouerbe? (<hi>So many men so many minds</hi>) thus may be answered: we sée by cōmon experience, that the highest flying fa●con, doth more cōmonly pray vpō the corn fed crow, &amp; the simple shiftles doue, then on the mounting kyte: and why? because the one is ouercome with lesse difficultie then that other. Thus much in defence of this Lady Fraunces, &amp; to excuse the choice of my friend <hi>F. I. </hi>who thought himself now no lesse beholding to good fortune, to haue found such a trusty friend, then bounden to Dame Venus, to haue wonne such a Mistres. And to returne vnto my pretence, vnderstand you, the <hi>F. I. </hi>(being now with these two fair Ladies come very néer the castle) grewe in some ielouse doubt (as on his own behalf) whether he were best to break cōpany or not. Whē his assured Hope, perceiuing the same, gan thus recomfort him: Good sir (<abbr>qd </abbr>she) if you trusted your trusty friends, you should not néede thus cowardly to stand in dread of your friendly enimies. Well said in faith (quod <hi>F. I. </hi>and I must confesse, you were in my bosome before I wist, but yit I haue heard said often, that in Trust is treason. Wel spokē for your self quod his <hi>Hope. F. I. </hi>now remembring that he had but erewhile taken vpon him the name of hir Trust, came home <foreign xml:lang="lat">per misericordiam</foreign>, when his Hope entring the Castle gate, caught hold of his lay, and <pb n="231" xml:id="ep000826-098-b"/>half by force led him by the gallery vnto his Mistre● chāber: wheras after a little dissembling disdain, he was at last by the good helpe of his Hope, right thankfully receyued: and for his Mistres was now ready to dyne, he was therfore for that time arested there, &amp; a supersedias sent into the great chāber vnto the Lord of the house, who expected his cōming out of the parke. The dinner ended, &amp; he throughly contented with t welfare &amp; welcome, they fell into sundry deuices of pastime: at last <hi>F. I. </hi>taking into his hand a Lute that lay on his Mistres bed, did vnto the note of the Venetian galliard applie the <hi></hi>Italian dittie written by the woorthy Bradamant vnto the noble Rugier, as Ari●sto hath it. <hi>Rugier qual semper fui, &amp;c. </hi>but his Mistres could not be quiet vntil shée heard him repeat the Tyntarnell which he vsed ouer night, the which <hi>F. I. </hi>〈…〉 <pb n="232" xml:id="ep000826-099-a"/>nights roste, with the bruse thereof. Well, seruaunt (quod she) content your selfe, and for your sake, I will speake to hir to prouide him a playster, the which I my selfe will applye to his hurt: And to the ende it may woorke the better with him, I will puruey a lodging for him, where hereafter he may sléepe at more quiet. This layd the rosie hewe, distained hir sickly chéekes, and she returned to the company, leauing <hi>F. I. </hi>rauished betwene hope and dread, as one that could neyther co●●ecture the meaning of hir misticall wordes, nor assuredly ●rust vnto the knot of hir slyding affections. When the Lady Fraunces cōming to him, demaunded, what? dreame you sir? Yea mary do I fayre Lady (quod he). And what was your dreame, sir (quod she?) I drempt (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) that wa●●ing in a pleasaunt garden garnished with sundrie 〈◊〉, my hap was to espie hanging in the ayre, a hope wher in I might well behold the aspectes and face of the heauens, and calling to remembrance the day and hower of my natiuitie, I did therby (according to my small skill in Astronomy) trie the conclusions of myne aduentures. And what found you therin (quod dame Fraunces?) you awaked me out of my dreame (quod he) or ells paraduenture you should not haue knowne. I beleue you well (quod the Ladi Fraunces) and laughing at his quicke aunswere brought him by the hand vnto the rest of his companie: where he ●aried not long before his gracious Mistresse had him to farewell, and to kepe his hower there againe, when he should by hir be sommoned. Hereby <hi>F. I. </hi>passed the rest of that daye in hope awayting the happy time when his Mistresse shoulde sende for him. Supper time came and passed ouer, and not long after came the handmayd of the Lady Elynor into the great chamber, desiring <hi>F. I. </hi>to repayre vnto their Mistresse, the which hée willingly accomplished: and being now entred into hir <pb n="233" xml:id="ep000826-099-b"/>chamber, he might perceyue his Mistresse in hir nightes attyre, preparinge hir selfe towardes bed, to whom <hi>F. I. </hi>sayed: Why howe now Mistresse? I had thought this night to haue sene you daunce (at least or at last) amongst vs? By my troth good seruaūt (<abbr>qd </abbr>she) aduentured so soone vnto the great chamber yesternight, that I find my selfe somewhat sickly disposed, and therfore do streyne curtesie (as you sée) to go the soner to my bed this night: but before I slepe (quod she) I am to charge you with a matter of waight, and taking him apart from the rest, declared that (as that present night) she would talke with him more at large in the gallery néere aioyning to hir chamber. Here vppon <hi>F. I. </hi>discretely dissimuling his ioye, toke his leaue and returned into the great chamber, where he had not long continued before the Lord of the Castell commaūded a torch to light him vnto his lodging, whereas he prepared himselfe and went to bed, commaunding his seruant also to go to his rest. And when he thought aswell his seruaunt, as the rest of the houshold to be safe, he arose again, &amp; taking his night gowne, did vnder the same conuey his naked sword, and so walked to the gallerie, where he found his good Mistresse walking in hir night gowne and attending his comming. The Moone was now at the full, the skies cleare, and the weather temperate, by reason wherof he might the more playnely and with the greater contentation behold his long desired ioyes, and spreding his armes abrode to embrace his louing Mistresse, he sayd: oh my deare Lady when shall I be able with any desert to counteruayle the least parte of this your bountifull goodnesse? The dame (whether it were of feare in déede, or that the wylynes of womanhode had taught hir to couer hir conceites with some fyue dissimulation) stert backe from the Kning●, and shriching (but softly) sayd vnto him. Alas seruaunt what haue I deserued, that you come against me with naked sword <pb n="234" xml:id="ep000826-100-a"/>as against an open enimie. <hi>F. I. </hi>perceyuing hir entent excused himselfe, declaring that he brought the same for their defence, &amp; not to offend hir in any wise. The Ladie being therwith somwhat apeased, they began w t more cōfortable gesture to expell the dread of the said late affright, and sithens to become bolder of behauiour, more familier in spéech, &amp; most kind in accomplishing of comon comfort. But why hold I so long discourse in discribing the ioyes which (for lacke of like experience) I cannot set out to the ful? Were it not that I knowe to whom I write, I would the more beware what I write. <hi>F. I. </hi>was a man, and neither of vs are sencelesse, and therfore I shold slaunder him, (ouer and besides a greater obloquie to the whole genealogie of Enaeas) if I should imagine that of tender hart he would forbeare to expresse hir more tender limbes against the hard floore. Suffised that of hir curteouse nature she was content to accept bords for a bead of downe, mattes for Camerike shéetes, and the night gowne of <hi>F. I. </hi>for a counterpoynt to couer them, and thus with calme cōtent, in stéede of quiet sléepe, they be●uiled the night, vntill the proudest sterre began to abandon the fyrmament, when <hi>F. I. </hi>and his Mistresse, were constrayned also to abandon their delightes, and with ten thousand swéet kisses and straight embracings, did frame themselues to play loth to depart. Wel, remedie was there none, but dame Elynor must returne vnto hir chamber, and <hi>F. I. </hi>must also conuey himselfe (as closely as might be) into his chamber, the which was hard to do, the day being so farre sprong, and hée hauing a large base court to passe ouer before he could recouer his staire foote doore. And though he were not much perceyued, yet the Ladie Fraunces being no lesse desirous to sée an issue of these enterprises, then <hi>F. I. </hi>was willing to couer them in secresy, did watch, &amp; euen at the entring of his chamber doore, perceyued the poynt of his naked sworde glistring <pb n="235" xml:id="ep000826-100-b"/>vnder the skyrt of his night gowne: wherat she smyled &amp; said to hir selfe, this geare goeth well about. Wel, <hi>F. I. </hi>hauing now recouered his chamber, he went to bedde, &amp; there let him sléepe, as his Mistresse did on that otherside. Although the Lady Fraunces being throughly tickled now in all the vaynes, could not enioye such quiet rest, but arising, toke another gentlewoman of the house with hir, and walked into the parke to take the freshe ayre of the morning. They had not long walked there, but they retorned, and though <hi>F. I. </hi>had not yet slept sufficiently, for one which had so farre trauayled in the night past, yet they went into his chamber to rayse him, and comming to his beds side, found him fast on sléepe. Alas ●uod that other gentlewoman, it were pitie to awake him: euen so it were quod dame Fraunces, but we will take awaye somewhat of his, wherby he may perceyue that we were here, and loking about the chamber, his naked sworde presented it selfe to the handes of dame Fraunces, who toke it with hir, and softly shutting his chamber doore againe, went downe the stayres and recouered hir owne lodging, in good order and vnperceyued of any body, sauing onely that other gentlewoman which accompanied hir. At the last <hi>F. I. </hi>awaked, and apparreling himselfe, walked out also to take the ayre, and being throughly recomforted aswell with remembraunce of his ioyes forepassed, as also with the pleasaunt hermony which the Byr●es made on euery side, and the fragrant smel of the redolent flowers and blossomes which budded on euery braunche: hée did in these delightes compyle these verses following. </p>
        <p>¶ The occasion (as I haue heard him rehearse) was by encoūter that he had with his Lady by light of the moone: and forasmuch, as the moone in middes of their delights did vanish away, or was ouerspred with a cloud, thereuppon <pb n="236" xml:id="ep000826-101-a"/>he toke the subiect of his theame. And thus it ensueth, called a imooneshine Banquet. </p>

        <p>THis Ballade, or howsoeuer I shall terme it, percase you will not like, and yet in my iudgement it hath great good store of déepe inuention, and for the order of the verse, it is not common, I haue not heard many of like proporcion, some will accompt it but a dyddeldome: but who so had heard <hi>F. I. </hi>sing it to the lute, by a note of his owne deuise, I suppose he would esteme it to bée a pleasaunt diddeldome, and for my part, if I were not parciall, I woulde saye more in commendacion of it than nowe I meane to do, leauing it to your and like iudgementes. And nowe to returns to my tale, by that time, that <hi>F. I. </hi>retorned out of the parke, it was dynner time, and at dynner they all met, I meane both dame Elynor, dame Fraunces, and <hi>F. I. </hi>I leaue to discribe that the Lady Fraunces was gorgeously attired, and set forth with very braue apparell, and <hi>Madame Elynor </hi>onely in hir night gowne gyrt to hir, with a coyfe trymmed <hi>Alla Piedmonteze</hi>, on the which she ware a little cap crossed ouer the crowne with two bends of yellowe Sarcenet or Cipresse, in the middest whereof she had placed (of hir owne had writing) in paper this word, Contented. This attyre pleased hir then to vse, and could not haue displeased Mistresse Fraunces, had she not bene more priuy to the cause, than to the thing it selfe: at least the Lord of the Castle of ignoraunce, and dame Fraunces of great temp●rance, let it passe without offence. At dynner, bicause the one was pleased with all former reconninges, and the <pb n="239" xml:id="ep000826-102-b"/>other made priuie to the accompt, there passed no word of taunt or grudge, but <foreign xml:lang="lat">omnia bene</foreign>. After dynner dame Elinor being no lesse desirouse to haue <hi>F. I. </hi>company, then dame Fraunces was to take him in some pretie trippe, they began to questiō how they might best passe the day: the Lady Elynor séemed desirous to kepe her chamber, but Mistresse Fraunces for another purpose séemed desirous to ryde abrode thereby to take the open ayre: they agréed to ryde a myle or twayne for sollace, and requested <hi>F. I. </hi>to accompany them, the which willingly graunted. Eche one parted from other, to prepare themselues, and now began the sporte, for when <hi>F. I. </hi>was booted, his horses sadled, and he ready to ryde, he gan mysse his Rapier, wherat al astonied he began to blame his man, but blame whom he would, found it could not be. At last the Ladies going towardes horsebacke called for him in the base Court, and demaunded if he were readie: to whom <hi>F. I. </hi>aunswered. Madames I am more than readie, and yet not so ready as I would be, and immediatly taking him selfe in trip, he thought best to vtter no more of his conceipt, but in hast more than good spéede mounted his horse, &amp; comming toward the dames presented him self, turning, bounding, &amp; taking vp his courser to the vttermost of his power in brauery: after suffering his horse to breath him selfe, he gan also allay his owne choller, &amp; to the dames he sayd. Fayre Ladies I am ready when it pleaseth you to ryde where so you commaund. How ready soeuer you be seruaunt, quod dame Elinor, it séemeth your horse is readier at your commaunde then at oures. If he bée at my commaund Mistresse (quod hée,) he shalbe at yours. Gramercy good seruaunt (quod shée) but my meaning is, that I feare he be to stirring for our cōpany. If he proue so Mistres <abbr>qd </abbr>
          <hi>F. I. </hi>I haue here a soberer palfrey to serue you on. The Dames being mounted they rode forthwardes by the space of a myle or very neare, and <hi>F. I. </hi>
          <pb n="240" xml:id="ep000826-103-a"/>(whether it were of his horses corage or his own choler) came not so neare them as they wished, at last the Lady Fraunces said vnto him: Maister I. you said that you had a soberer horse, which if it be so, we wold be glad of your company, but I beleue by your coūtinance, your horse &amp; you are agréed. <hi>F. I. </hi>alighting called his seruaunt, chaūged horses with him, and ouertaking the Dames, said to Mistres Fraunces: And why doe you thinke faire Lady that my horse and I are agréed? Bicause by your countenance (quod she) it seemeth your pacience is stirred. In good faith, quod <hi>F. I. </hi>you haue gessed a right, but not with any of you. Then we care the lesse seruaunt, quod Dame <hi>Elinor▪ </hi>By my troth Mistres. <abbr>qd </abbr>
          <hi>F. I. </hi>(looking well about him that none might heare but they two) it is with my seruaunt, who hath lost my sword out of my chamber. Dame Elinor little remembring the occasion, replied it is no matter seruaunt, quod shee, you shall heare of it againe, I warrant you, and presently wée ryde in Gods peace, and I turst shall haue no néede of it: yet Mistresse quod he, a weapon serueth both vses, aswell to defend, as to offend. Now by my troth, quod Dame Fraunces, I haue now my dream, for I dreamt this night that I was in a pleasaunt meadow alone, where I met with a tall Gentleman, apparelled in a night gowne of silke all embroadered about with a gard of naked swords, and when he came towardes me I séemed to be afraide of him, but he recomforted me saying, be not afrayd fayre Lady, for I vse this garment onely for myne own defence: and in this sort went that warlicke God Mars what time hée taught dame Venus to make Vulcan a hamer of the newe fashion. Notwithstanding these comfortable wordes the fright of the dreame awaked me, and sithens vnto this hower I haue not slept at al. And what tyme of the night dreamt you this quod <hi>F. I</hi>? In the grey morning about daw●ing of the day, but why aske you quod dame <hi>Fran̄ces? <pb n="241" xml:id="ep000826-103-b"/>F. I. </hi>with a great sigh answered, because that dreames are to be marched more at some hower of the night, then at some other, why are you so cunning at the interpretation of dreames seruaunt (quod the Lady Elynor?) not very cunning Mistresse quod F.I. but gesse, like a young scholler. The dames continued in these and like pleasant talkes: but <hi>F. I. </hi>could not be mery, as one that estemed the preseruation of his Mistresse honor no lesse then the obtayning of his owne delightes: and yet to auoyde further suspicion, he repressed his passions, asmuch as hée could. The Lady Elynor more carelesse then consideratiue of hir owne case, pricking forwardes said softly to <hi>F. I. </hi>I had thought you had receiued small cause seruaunt to bée thus dumpish, when I would be mery. Alas déere Mistresse quod <hi>F. I. </hi>it is altogether for your sake, that I am pensife: dame Fraunces with curtesie withdrewe hir sel●e and gaue them leaue when as <hi>F. I. </hi>declared vnto his Mistresse, that his sword was taken out of his chamber, and that he dreaded much by the wordes of the Lady Fraunces, that she had some vnderstanding of the matter. Dame Elynor now calling to remembraunce what had passed the same night, at the first was abashed, but immediatly (for these women be redely wyt●ed) chered hir seruaunt, and willed him to commit vnto hir the saluing of that s●re. Thus they passed the rest of the waye in pleasaunt talke with dame Fraunces, and so returned towards the Castle where <hi>F. I. </hi>suffered the two dames to go together, and he alone vnto his chamber to bewayle his owne misgouernement. But dame Elynor (whether it wer according to olde custome, or by wylie pollicie) found meane that night, that the sword was conueyed out of Mistres Fraunces chamber and brought vnto hirs and after redeliuerie of it vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>she warned him to be more wary from that time forthwards: well I dwell too long vppon these particular poynts in discoursing this trif●ing history, but <pb n="242" xml:id="ep000826-104-a"/>that the same is the more apte meane of introduction to the verses, which I meane to reherse vnto you, and I think you wil not disdaine to read my conceipt with his inuention about declaration of his commedie. The next that euer <hi>F. I. </hi>wrote thē, vpon any aduēture hapned betwene him and this fayre Lady, was this as I haue heard him say, and vppon this occasion. After he grew more bold &amp; better acquaynted with his Mistresse disposition, he aduentured one Fryday in the morning to go vnto hir chāber, and theruppon wrote as followeth: which he termed a Frydayes Breakefast. </p>

When these verses were by the negligence of his Mistresse dispersed into sundry hands, and so at last to the reading of a Courtier. Well <hi>F. I. </hi>had his desire if his Mistresse lyked them, but as I haue heard him declare, she grew in ieolosie, that the same were not written by hir, because hir name was Elynor and not Hellen. And about this poynt haue bene diuers and sundry opinions, for this and diuers other of his most notable Poems, haue come to view of the world, althogh altogether wtout his cōsent. And some haue attributed this prayse vnto a Hellen, who deserued not so well as this dame Elynor should séeme to deserue by the relation of <hi>F.

        <p>OF this Sonet I am assured that it is but a t●anslation, for I my selfe haue séene the inuention of an Italian, and Master I. hath a little dylated the same, but not much besides the sence of the first, and the addicion very aptly applied: wherfore I cannot condempne his doing therin, and for the Sonet, were it not a little to much prayse (as the Italians do most commonly offend in the superlatiue) I could the more commend it: but I hope the partie to whom it was dedicated, had rather it were much more, than any thing lesse. Well, thus these two Louers passed many dayes in exceding contentation▪ ● more than speakeable pleasures, in which time <hi>F. I. </hi>did compyle very many verses according to sundrie occasions proffred, whereof I haue not obteyned the most at his handes▪ and the reason that he denied me the same, was that (as he alleged) they were for the most part sauced with a taste of glory, as you know that in such cases a louer being charged with ine●priuable ioyes, and therewith enioyned both by dutie and discretion to kepe the same couert, can by no meanes deuise a greater consolation, than to commit it into some cyphred wordes and figured spéeches in verse, whereby he féeleth his harte halfe (or more than halfe) eased of swelling. For as sighes are some present ease to the pensife mind, euen so we find by experience, that such secrete of ioyes doth encrease delight. I would not haue you conster my wordes to this ●ffecte, that I thinke a man cannot sufficiently reioyce in <pb n="247" xml:id="ep000826-106-b"/>the luckie lottes of loue, vnlesse he empart the same to others: God forbid that euer I should enter into such a● heresie, for I haue alwayes bene of this opinion, that as to be fortunate in loue, is one of the most inward contentatious to mans mynde of all earthly ioyes: euen so if hée do but once bewray the same to any liuing creature, imemdiatlye eyther dread of discouering doth bruse his brest with an intollerable burden, or els he léeseth the principall vertue which gaue effecte to his gladnes, not vnlike to a Potycaries pot which being filled with swéete oyntmentes or parfumes, doth reteyne in it selfe some sent of the same, and being powred out doth returne to the former state, hard, harshe, and of small sauour: So the minde being fraught with delightes, as long as it can kepe them secretly enclosed, may continually féede vppon the pleasaunt record thereof as the well willing and readie horse byteth on the brydle, but hauing once disclosed them to any other, strayghtway we loose the hidden treasure of the same, and are oppressed with sundry doubtfull opinions and dreadfull conceipts. And yet for a man to record vnto him selfe in the inward contemplation of his mynde the often remembrance of his late receiued ioyes, doth as it were ease the hart of burden, and ad vnto the mynd a fresh supplie of delight, yea and in verse principally (as I conceyue) a man may best contriue this way of comforte in him selfe. Therfore as I haue sayde <hi>F. I. </hi>swymming now in delightes did nothing but write such verse as might accumilate his ioyes, to the extremitie of pleasure, the which for that purpose he kept from mée, as one more desirous to séeme obscure and defectiue, than ouermuch to glory in his aduentures, especially for that in the end his hap was as heauie, has hitherto he had bene fortunate, amongst other I remembred one hapned vppon this occasion. The husband of the Lady Elynor be-being all this while absent from hir, gan now retorne, &amp; <pb n="248" xml:id="ep000826-107-a"/>kept Cut at home, with whom F.I. found meanes so to ensignuate himselfe, that familiaritie tooke déepe ●oot● betwene them, and seldome but by ●●elth you could ●●nde the one out of the others company. On a tyme the knight ryding on hunting desired <hi>F. I. </hi>to accompany him, the which he could not refuse to do, but like a lusty younker, readie at all assayes, apparrelled him selfe in gréene, and about his neck a Bugle, pricking &amp; gallowping amongst the formost, according to the mannor of that countrie. And it chaūced that the maried Knight thus gallowping lost his horn, which some deuines might haue interpreted to be but moulting, &amp; that by Gods grace, he might haue a newe come vp againe shortly in stéede of that. Wel, he came to <hi>F. I. </hi>requiring him to lend him his▪ Beugle, for (sayd the Knight) I hard you not blowe this daye, and I would fayne encourage the houndes, if I had a horne. Quod <hi>F. I. </hi>although I haue not ben ouer lauishe of my comming hitherto, I woulde you shoulde not doubt but that I can tell howe to vse a horne well enough, and yet I may little do if I maye not lende you a horne, and therewithall tooke his Beugle from his necke, and lent it to the Knight, who making in vnto the houndes, gan assaye to rechate: but the horne was to hard for him to wynde, whereat <hi>F.

        <p>THis Sonet treateth of a straung séede, but it tasteth most of Rye, which is more cōmon amongst mē nowadays: wel let it passe amōgst the rest, &amp; he that liketh it not, turn ouer the leaf to another, I dout not but in this register he may find some to content him, vnlesse he be to curious: and here I will surcease to rehearse any more of his verses, vntill I haue expressed how that his ioyes being now exalted to the highest degrée, began to bend towardes declination. For now the vnhappy Secretary whom I haue before remembred, was returned from London, on whō F.I. had no sooner cast his eyes, but immediatly he fel into a great passion of mynd, which might be compared vnto a feauer. This fruit grew of the good instructions that his Hope had planted in his mind, whereby I might take iust occasion to forwarn euery louer, how they suffer this venemous serpent ielousie to créepe into their conceipts: for surely, of all other diseases in loue, I suppose that to be vncurable, and would hold longer discourse therin, were <pb n="250" xml:id="ep000826-108-a"/>it not that both this tale and the verses of <hi>F. I. </hi>himselfe hereafter to be recited, shalbe sufficient to speak for me in this behalf. The louer (as I say vpon the sodein) was drouen into such a malladie, as no meate might nourish his body, no delights please his minde, no remembrance of ioyes forepassed content him, nor any hope of the lyke to come might recomfort him: hereat (some vnto whom I haue imparted this tale) haue takē occasion to discōmend his faynting hart, yit surely the cause inwardly, &amp; depely considered, I cannot so lightly condempne him, for an old saying is, that euery man can giue councell better than follow it: and néeds must the conflicts of his thoughts be straunge, betwene the remembraunce of his forepassed pleasure, and the present sight of this monster whom before (for lack of like instruction) he had not so throughly marked and beh●l●. Well, such was the grief vnto him, that he became sickly and kept his chamber. The Ladies hauing receyued the newes therof, gan al at once lament his misfortun, and of common consent agréed to visit him: they marched thither in good equipage, I warrant you, and found <hi>F. I. </hi>lying vpon his bed languishing, whō they all saluted generally, and sought to recomforte, but especially his Mistresse, hauing in hir hand a braunch of willow, wherewith thée defended hir from the whot ayre, gā thus say vnto him: Seruaunt (quod she) for that I suppose your mallady to procéede of none other cause but only slouthfulnesse, I haue brought this preaty rod to beate you a little: nothing doubting, but when you féele the smart of a twig or twayne, you will like a tractable yong scholler, pluck vp your quickned spirits, &amp; cast this drowsines apart. <hi>F. I. </hi>with a great sighe answered: Alas good Mistres (quod he) if any like chastisement might quicken me, how m●ch more might the presence of all you louely Dames? recomfort my dulled mynd whō to behold▪ were sufficien● to reuiue an eye now dazled with the dread of <pb n="251" xml:id="ep000826-108-b"/>death, and that not onely for the heauenly aspectes which you represent, but also much the more for your excéeding curtesie, in that you haue deigned to visit mée so vnworthy a seruaunt: But good Mistres (quod he) as it were shame for me to confesse that euer my hart could yéelde for feare, so I assure you that my minde cannot be content to induce infirmitie by sluggish conceyt: But in trueth Mistresse I am sicke (quod he), and there withall the trembling of his hart had sent vp such throbbing into his throte, as that his voyce (now depriued of breath) cōmaunded the tong to be still. When Dame Elynor for compassion distilled into teares, and drew towards the window, leauing the other Gentlewomē about his bed, who beinge no lesse sory for his grief, yit for that they were none of them so touched in their secrete thoughtes, they had bolder sprits and fréeer spéech to recomfort him: amongest the rest the Lady Fraunces, (who in deede loued him déepely, and could best coniecture the cause of his cōceipts) said vnto him: Good Trust (quod shée) if any helpe of Phisick may cure your maladie, I would not haue you hurt your selfe with these doubts which you séeme to retayne: If choice of Dyet may helpe, behold vs here (your cookes) ready to minister all things néedfull: if company may dryue away your anoye, wee meane not to leaue you solitary: if grief of mynde be cause of your infirmitie, wée all here will offer our deuoyre to turne it into ioye: if mishap haue giuen you cause to feare or dreade any thing, remember Hope, which neuer fayleth to recomfort an afflicted mind. And good Trust (quod she) (distreining his hand right hartely) let this simple profe of our poore good willes be so accepted of you, as that ●t may work therby the effect of our desires. <hi>F. I. </hi>(as one in a traunce) had marked very litle of hir curteouse talke, and yet gaue hir thanks, and so held his peace: whereat the <pb n="252" xml:id="ep000826-109-a"/>Ladies (being all amazed) there became a silence in the chamber on all sides. Dame Elynor fearing thereby that she might the more easely be espyed, and hauing nowe dryed vp hir teares, returned to <hi>F. I. </hi>recomforting him by al possible meanes of common curtesie, promising that since in hir sicknes he had not only staūched hir bléeding, but also by his gentle company and sundry deuices of honest pastime had dryuē away the pensiuenes of hir mind, she thought hir selfe bound with like willingnes to do hir best in any thing that might restore his health? and taking him by the hand sayd further: Good seruaunt, if thou beare in déed any true affection to thy poore Mistres, start vpon thy féet agayn, and let hir enioye thyne accustomed seruice to hir comfort, for sure (quod shée) I will neuer leaue to visite this chamber once in a day, vntill I may haue thée down with mée. <hi>F. I. </hi>hearing the harty words of his Mistres, and perceyuing the earnest maner of hir pronunciation, began to receyue vnspeakable comfort in the same, and sayde. Mistres, your excéeding curtesie were able to reuiue a man half dead, and to me it is both great comfort, and it doth also gald my remembraunce with a continuall smart of myn own vnworthinesse: but as I would desire no longer lyfe, than til I might be able to deserue some part of your bounty, so I will ende●our my selfe to liue, were it but onely vnto that ende, that I might merit some part of your fauour with acceptable seruice, and requite some deale the courtesie of all these other faire Ladies, who haue so farre (aboue my desertes) deigned to do me good. Thus said, the Ladies tarried not long before they were called to Euensong, when his Mistres taking his hand, kissed it saying: Farewell good seruaunt, and I pray thée suffer not the malice of thy sicknesse to ouercome the gentlenes of thy good hart. F.I. rauished with ioy, suffered them all to depart, and was not <pb n="253" xml:id="ep000826-109-b"/>able to pronounce one word. After their departure, hée gan cast in his mind the excéeding curtesie vsed towards him by them all: but aboue all other the bounty of his Mistresse, and therewithall tooke a sounde and firme opinion, that it was not possible for hir to coūterfeit so déeply (as in déed I beléeue that she then did not) whereby he sodenly felt his hart greatly eased, and began in himselfe thus to reason. Was euer man of so wretched a harte? I am the most bounden to loue (quod he) of all them that euer professed his seruice, I enioy one the fayrest that euer was found, and I find hir the kindest that euer was heard of: yit in myne owne wicked hart I could villaynously conceiue that of hir, which being compared with the rest of hir vertues is not possible to harbour in so noble a mind. Hereby I haue brought my self without cause into this féeblenes, and good reason that for so high an offence I should be punished with great infirmitie: what shall I then doe? yéeld to the same? no, but according to my late protestation I will recomfort this languishing mind of myne, to the end I may liue but onely to doe penaunce for this so notable a crime so rashly committed: and thus saying, he start from his bed, and gan to walke towards the window: but the venimous serpent which (as before I rehearsed) had stong him, could not bee content that these medicines applied by the mouth of his gentle Mistresse, should so soone restore him to guerison. And although in déed they were such Mythrydate to <hi>F. I. </hi>as that they had nowe expelled the rancour of the poyson, yit that ougly hellish monster had left behinde hir in the most secret of his bosome, (euen betwene the mynd and the man) one of hir familiars named Suspect, which gan work in the weake sprites of <hi>F. I. </hi>efects of no lesse perill than before hée had conceyued: his head swelling with these troublesome toyes, and his hart swimming in the tempests of tossing fantasie: he felt his legges so féeble, <pb n="254" xml:id="ep000826-110-a"/>that he was cōstrained to lye down on his bed again, and repeating in his own remembraunce euery woord that his Mistres had spoken vnto him, he gan to dreade, that she had brought the willow braunch to beate him with, in token that he was of hir forsaken: for so louers doe most commonly expound the will● we garland, and this to think, did cut his hart in twayne. A wonderfull chaunge: and here a little to stay you, I will discribe (for I think you haue not red it in Ariosto) the beginning, the fall, the retourne, and the bying of this hellish byrd, who in déed may well be counted a very limbe of the Diuill. Many yeares since, one of the most dreadful dastards in the world, and one of them that first deuised to weare his beard at length, least the barbor might do him a good turne sooner than he looked for it, and yit not so soone as he deserued, had builded for his securitie a pile on the hyghest and most inaccessible mount of all his Territories: the which being fortified with strong walles, and enuironed with déepe ditches, had no place of entrie, but one onely doore so streight and narrow, as might by any possibility receiue the body of one liuing man, from which he ascended vp a ladder, &amp; so créeping thorough a maruelous strayt hole, attained to his lodging, the which was so dark &amp; obscure, as scarcely either sunne or ayre could enter into it: thus hee deuised to lodge in safetie, and for the more suertie gan trust none other letting downe this ladder but only his wife, and at the foote therof kept alwaies by day light, a firce masti● close enkeneled which neuer sawe nor heard the face or voyce of any other creature but onely of them two, him by night he trusted with the scout of this prety passage, hauing neuerthelesse betwene him and this dogge, a double doore with treble locks, quadriple barres: and before all a port coulez of Iron: neyther yit could he be so hardy as to sléep vntil he had caused a gard of seruauntes (whome hée kept abroade for that purpose) to searche all the corners adioyning to his fortresse, <pb n="255" xml:id="ep000826-110-b"/>and then betwene fearfull sweate and chyuering cold, with one eye open and the other closed, he stole somtimes a broken sléepe, deuided with many terrible dream●s. In this sort the wretch liued all to long, vntill at last his wife being not able any longer to supporte this hellish life, grew so hardy, as with his owne knife to dispatch his carkas out of this earthly purgatory: the which being done his soule (and good reason) was quickly conueyed by Carone vnto hell: there Radamanthus Iudge of that benche, commaunded him quickly to be thrust into a boyling poole: and being therein plonged very often, he neuer shriked or cryed, I skalde, as his other companions there cried, but séemed so lightly to estéeme it, that the Iudge thought méete to condempne him vnto the most terrible place, where are such torments, as neyther penne can write, tongue expresse, or thought conceyue: but the myser (euen there) seemed to smyle and to make small accompt of his punishment. Radamanthus hereof enformed▪ sent for him, and demaunded the cause why he made so light of his durance? he aunswered that whyles he liued on earth, he was so continually afflicted and oppressed with suspicion, as that now (only to thinke that he was out of those meditacions) was sufficient armour to defend him from all other torments. Radamanthus a●●onied hereat, gan call togither the Senators of that kingdome, and propounded this question, how &amp; by what punishement they might deuise to touche him according to his deserts? and herupō fell great disputation, at last being cōsidered that he had already bin plonged in the most vnspeakable torments, &amp; therat litle or nothing had chaunged coūtenāce, therwithall that no soule was sent vnto thē to be relieued of his smart, but rather to be punished for his former delights: it was cōcluded by the general councel, that he shold be eftsones sent into the world &amp; restored to the same body wherein he first had his resiance, so to remain for perpetuity, and neuer to depart nor to perish. <pb n="256" xml:id="ep000826-111-a"/>Thus this body and soule being once againe vnited, and now eftsones with the same pestilence infected, hée became of a suspicious man Suspicion it selfe: and now the wretch remembring the treason of his wyfe, who had so willingly dispatched him once before, gan vtterly abhor hir and fled hir company, searching in all countries some place of better assurance: and when hée had in vayn trode on the most part of the earth, he embarked himself to find some vnknowen Iland wherein hée might frame s●me new habitacion, and finding none so commodious as hée desired, he fortuned (sayling along by the shoare) to espie a rock, more than sixe hundreth Cubits high, which hong so suspiciously ouer the seas, as though it would threaten to fall at euery little blast: this did Suspicion Imagine to be a fit foundacion whereon he might buyld his second Bower: hée forsooke his boate, and trauayled by land to espie what entrie or accesse might be made vnto the same, and found from land no maner of entrie or accesse, vnlesse it were that some curteouse Byrd of the ayre would be Ambassadour, or conuey some Engins, as whilom the Eagle did carrie Ganymedes into heauen. He then returned to Seas, and approching néere to his rock, founde a small streame of fresh water issuing out of the same into the Seas: the which, although it were so little and so straight, as might vnethes receiue a boate of bignes to carry one liuing creature at once, yit in his conceipt hée thought it more large and spacious than that broad way called of our forefathers <foreign xml:lang="lat">Via appia</foreign>, or than that other named Flaminia: hée abandoned his bark, and putting of hys clothes, aduētured (for he was now assured not to drown) to wade and swim against the streame of this vnknown brooke, the which (a wondrous thing to tell, and skarcely to be beléeued) came down from the very top and height of this rock: and by the way he found six straight &amp; dangerous places, wher the water séemed to stay his course, <pb n="257" xml:id="ep000826-111-b"/>passing vnder sixe straight and lowe bridges, and hard by euery of those places, a pyle raysed vp in manner of a Bulworke, the which were hollow, in such sort as lodginges and other places necessary might in them commodiously be deuised, by such one as coulde endure the hellishnes of the place. Passing by these hée attayned with much payne vnto the toppe of the Rocke, the which hée found hollowed as the rest, and farre more fit for his securitie, than otherwise apt for any cōmoditie. There gan suspicion determyne to nestle him selfe, and hauing now placed six chosen porters, to wit, <hi>(Dread, Mistrust, Wrath, Desperation, Frensie, and Fury:) </hi>at these six straunge Bulworks, he lodged him self in the vij. al alone, for he trusted no companye, but euer mistrustinge that his wyfe should eftsones find him out, therein he shrieketh continually like to a shrich owle to keepe the watch waking, neuer content to sléepe by day or by night. But to be sure that he shoulde not ouer sléepe him selfe, gan stuffe his ●ouch with Porpentines quilles, to the ende that when heauy sleepe ouercame him, and he therby should be constrayned to charge his pallad with more heauie burden, those plumes might then pricke through and so awake him. His garments were stéele vpon Iron, and that Iron vppon Iron, and Iron againe, and the more he was armed, the lesse he trusted to be out of daunger. He chopped and changed continually now this, now that, new keyes, new lockes, ditches newe skowred, and walles newly fortified, and thus alwayes vncontented liueth this wretched helhound Suspicion in this hellish dungion of habitation, from whence he neuer remoueth his foote, but only in the dead &amp; silent nights, when he may be assured that all creatures (but him selfe) are whelmed in sound sléepe. And then with stealing steps he stalketh about the earth, enfecting, tormēting, and ve●ing al kinds of people with some part of his afflictions, but especially such as either <pb n="258" xml:id="ep000826-112-a"/>do sit in chayre of greatest dignitie and estimation, or els such as haue atchiued some déere and rare emprise: Those aboue al others he contynually galdeth with fresh woūds of dread, least they might loose and forgo the roomes wherunto with such long trauayle and good happes they had atteyned, and by this meanes percase he had crept into the bosome of F.I. who (as is before declared) did earst swimme in the déepest seas of earthly delightes. Nowe then I must thinke it high time to retorne vnto him, who being now through feeblenes eftsones cast downe vppon his be●, gan cast in his inward meditations all thinges passed, and as one throughly puffed vp and filled with one péeuishe conceipt, could thinke vppon nothing elles, and yet accusing his owne giltie conscience to be infected with ielosie, did compyle this translation of Ariostoes xxxi. song as followeth. </p>

        <p>THis is the translation of Ariosto his xxxj. song, all but the last staffe, which séemeth as an allegory applied to the rest. It will please none but learned eares, hée was tyed to the inuention, troubled in mynd &amp;c. So I leaue it to your iudgment, and returne to F.I. who continued on his bed, vntill his bountifull Mistresse with the companie of the other curteous dames retorned after supper to his chamber, at their first entrie: Why how now seruāt (quod dame Elynor) we hoped to haue found you on foote? Mistresse quod F.I. I haue assayed my féete since your departure, but I find them yet vnable to suporte my heauy body, and therfore am constrayned as you sée, to acquaint my selfe with these pyllowes. Seruaunt sayd she I am right sory therof, but since it is of necessitie to beare sicknesse, I will employ my deuoyre to allaye some parte of your paynes, and to refreshe your weary limbes with some comfortable matter: and therwithall calling hir handmayde, deliuered vnto hir a bounche of pretie little keyes, and whispering in hir eare, dispatched hir towards hir chamber. The mayde taried not long, but returned with a little Casket, the which hir Mistresse toke, opened and drew out of the same much fyne lynnen, amongst the which she toke a pillowhere very fyne and swéete, which although it were of it selfe as swéete as might be, being of long time kept in that odoriferous chest, yet did shée with damaske water (and that the best that might bée I warrant you) all to sprinckle it with hir owne handes, which in my conceipt might much amende the matter. Then calling for a fresh pyllowe, sent hir mayde to ayre the same, and at hir returne put on this, thus perfumed pillowheare. In meane time also she had with hir owne hands attyred hir seruants head in a fayre wrought kerchif taken out of the same Casket, then layde him downe vppon this fresh and pleasaunt place, and pretely as it were in sporte, bedewed his temples with swéete <pb n="261" xml:id="ep000826-113-b"/>water which she had ready in a casting bottle of Gold, kissing his chéeke and saying: Good seruaunt be whole, for I might not longe endure thus to attende thée, and yit the loue that I beare towards thée, cannot be content to see thée languish: Mistres sayd F.I. (and that with a trembling voyce) assure your self, that if there remayn in mée any sparke of lyfe or possibilitie of recouery, then may this excellent bountie of yours be sufficient to reuiue me without any further trauayle or payn vnto your persone, for whom I am highly to blame, in that I do not spare to put you vnto this trouble: and better if were that such a wretch as I had dyed vnknowen, than thay by your exceding curtesie you should fall into any mallady, eyther by resorting vnto me, or by these your paynes taken about me. Seruaunt (quod she) all pleasures séeme paynefull to them that take no delight therin, and likewise all toyle séemeth pleasaunt to such as set their felicitie in the same, but for mee be you sure, I do it with so good a wyll that I can take no hurt therby, vnlesse I shall perceyue that it be reiected or neglected, as vnprofitable or vncomfortable vnto you. To me Mistresse quod F.I. it is such pleasure, as neither my féeble tongue can expresse, nor my troubled mind conceyue. Why? are you troubled in mynd then seruaunt quod dame <hi>Elynor? F. I </hi>now blushing answered, but euen as all sicke men be Mistresse. Herewith they staid their talke a while, and the first that brake silence was the Lady Fraunces, who sayde: and to driue away the troubles of your mynd good Trust, I wold be glad if we could deuise some pastime amongst vs to kepe you company, for I remember that with such deuises you did greatly recomfort this fayre Lady when shée languished in like sorte. She languished in déede gentle Hope, quod F.I. but God forbid that she had languished in like sort. Euery body thinketh their griefe greatest <abbr>qd </abbr>dame Elynor, but in déede whether my griefe were the <pb n="262" xml:id="ep000826-114-a"/>more or the lesse, I am right sorie that youres is such as it is: And to assay whither our passions proceded of like cause or not, I would we could (according to this Ladies saying) deuise some like pastimes to trie if your malladie would be cured with like medicines. A gentle woman of the company whom I haue not hitherto named, and that for good respects, least hir name might altogether disclose the rest, gan thus propound. We haue accustomed (quod she) heretofore in most of our games to chuse a Kyng or Quéene, and he or she during their gouernement haue charged euery of vs eyther with commaundementes or questions as best séemed to their maiestie: wherein to speake mine opinion we haue giuen ouer large a skope, neyther séemeth it reasonable that one shoulde haue the power to discouer the thoughts▪ or at least to brydle the affects of all the rest. And though in déede in questioning (which doth of the twayne more nerely touche the mind) euery one is at free libertie to aunswere what they list: yet oft haue I heard a question demaunded in such sorte, and vppon such sodayne, that it hath bene hardly answered without mouing matter of contention. And in commaundes also, sometimes it happeneth one to bée commaunded vnto such seruice, as eyther they are vnfit to accomplish (and then the parties weakenes is therby detected) or els to do something that they would not, wherof ensueth more grutch then game. Wherefore in myne opinion, we shall do well to chuse by lot amongst vs a gouernour, who for that it shalbe sufficient preheminence to vse the chayre of maiestie, shalbe boūd to giue sentence vppon all such arguments and questions as we shall orderly propound vnto them, and from him or hir (as from an oracle) we will receiue aunswere, and decyding of our lytigious causes. This dame had stuffe in hir, an old courtier, and a wylie wench, whome for this discourse I will name Pergo, least hir name natural were to brode before, <pb n="263" xml:id="ep000826-114-b"/>and might not drinke of all waters. Wel this proportion of Pergo pleased them wel, and by lot it happened that F.I. must be moderator of these matters, and collector of these causes: the which being so constituted, the Lady Elynor said vnto this dame Pergo. You haue deuised this pastime (<abbr>qd </abbr>she) &amp; because we thinke you to be most expert in the handling therof, do you propound the first question, &amp; we shalbe both the more readye and able to followe your example: the Lady Pergo refused not, but began on this wise. Noble gouernor (<abbr>qd </abbr>she) amongst the aduentures that haue befallen me, I remember especially this one, that in youth it was my chaunce to be beloued of a very courtlike young gentleman, who abode neare the place wherin my parents had their resiaunce. This gentleman whether it were for beauty▪ or for any other respect that he sawe in me, I know not, but he was enamored of me, &amp; that with an exceding vehement passion, &amp; of such force were his affects, that notwithstanding many repulses which he had receiued at my hands, he séemed dayly to growe in the renewing of his desires. I on the otherside, although I could by no meanes mislike of him by any good reason, considering that hée was of byrth no waye inferior vnto me, of possessions not to bée disdeyned, of parson right comely, of behauyour Courtly, of manners modest, of mynde lyberall, and of verteous disposition: yet such was the gaitie of my mynd, as that I coulde not be content to lend him ouer large thongs of my loue, but alwayes daungerously behaued my selfe towardes him, and in such sorte, as hée coulde neyther take comforte of myne aunsweres, nor yet once finde him selfe requited with one good looke for all his trauayle. This notwithstanding, the worthy Knigh● continued his sute wyth no lesse vehement affection than earst hée hadde begone it, euen by the space of seuen yeares. At the last, whether discomfited by my dealinges, or tyred by long trauayle, <pb n="264" xml:id="ep000826-115-a"/>or that he had percase light vppon the lake that is in the forrest of Ardena, and so in haste and all thristie, had dronke some droppes of disdayne, whereby his hot flames were quenched, or that he had vndertaken to serue no longer but his iust terme of apprenticehode, or that the téeth of time had gnawen and tyred his dulled sprites in such sorte, as that all béenommed hée was constrayned to vse some other artificial balme for the quickning of his sences, or by what cause moued I know not, he did not onely leaue his long continued sute, but (as I haue since perceyed) grew to hate me more deadly than before I had disdayned him. At the first beginning of his retyre I perceiued not his hatred, but imagined that being ouer wearied he had withdrawen him self for a time. And considring his worthynes, therwithall his constancie of long time proued, I thought that I could not in the whole world find out a fitter match to bestowe my selfe, than on so worthy a person, wherefore I did by all possible meanes procure that he might eftsones vse his accustomed repayre vnto my parents: And further, in all places where I happened to méete him, I vsed all the curtes●es towardes him that might bée contayned within the bondes of modestie, but al was in vayne, for he was now become more daungerous to be wonne, than the haggard Faulcon. Our lottes being thus vnluckely chaunged, I grewe to burne in desire, and the more daungerous that he shewed him selfe vnto me, the more earnest I was by all meanes to procure his consent of loue. At the last I might perceiue that not onely he disdayned me, but as me thought boyled in hatred against me: and the time that I thus continued tormented with these thoughts, was also iust the space of seuen yeares. Finally when I perceiued no remedie for my parplexities, I assayed by absence to weare away this malladie, and therfore vtterly refused to come in his presence, yea or almost in any other company, <pb n="265" xml:id="ep000826-115-b"/>whereby I haue consumed in lost time the flower of my youth, and am become as you sée (what with yeares, and what with the tormēting passions of loue) pale, wan, and full of wrinkles, neuerthelesse, I haue therby gayned thus much, that at last I haue wond my self cléere out of Cupids cheines, and remain carelesse at libertie. </p>
        <p>Now marke to what end I tell you this: first vii. yeares passed in the which I could neuer be content to yéeld vnto his iust desires: next other vii. yeares I spent in séeking to recouer his lost loue: and sithens both those vii. yeares, there are euen now on saint Valentines day last, other vii. yeares passed, in the which (neither I haue desired to sée him) nor he hath coueted to heare of me. My parents now perceiuing how the crowes foot is crept vnder myne eye, and remembring the long sute that this gentlemā had in youth spent on me, considering therewithall that gréene youth is well mellowed in vs both, haue of late sought to perswade a marriage betwene vs, the which the Knight hath not refused to heare of, and I haue not disdained to thinke on: by their mediation we haue bin eftsoones brought to Parlee, wherein ouer and besides the ripping vp of many old griefes, this hath ben chiefly rehearsed &amp; obiected betwene vs, what wrong and iniury eche of vs hath done to other, and hereabouts wée haue fallen to sharpe contention: he alledged, that much greater is the wrong which I haue done vnto him, than that repulse which hée hath sithens vsed to me: and I haue affirmed the contrary, the matter yit hangeth in variance. Nowe, of you worthy Gouernour I would be most glad to heare this question decided, remembring that ther was no difference in the times betwene vs: and surely, vnles your iudgement helpe me, I am afraide my marriage wilbe marred, and I may goe lead Apes in hell. <hi>F. I. </hi>aunswered, good Pergo, I am sory to heare so lamentable a discourse of your luckles loue, and much the sorier, in that I <pb n="266" xml:id="ep000826-116-a"/>must néedes giue sentence against you: for surely great was the wrong that either of you haue done to other, and greater was the néedelesse grief which causelesse eche of you hath conceiued in this long time, but greatest in my iudgement hath ben both the wrong and the grief of the Knight, in that notwithstanding his deserts (which your self confesse) he neuer enioyed any guerdone of loue at your handes: And you (as you alledge) did enioy his loue of long time togither, so that by the reckoning, it will fall out (although being blinded in your owne conceypt) you sée it not, that of the one &amp; twenty yeares you enioyed his loue vii. at the least, but that euer he enioyed yours wee cannot perceiue. And much greater is the wrong that rewardeth euill for good, than that which requireth tip for tap: further, it séemed that where as you went about in time to trie him, you did altogither loose time which can neuer be recouered: and not onely lost your owne time, whereof you would séeme now to lament, but also compelled him to leese his time, which he might (be it spoken without offence to you) haue bestowed in some other worthy place: and therefore, as that grief is much greater which hath no kind of cōfort to allay it, so much more is that wrong which al●●gither without cause is offered. And I (said Pergo) must néedes think, that much easier is it for them to endure grief which neuer tasted of ioy, and much lesse is that wrong which is so willingly profered to be by recompence restored: for if this Knight will confesse that he neuer had cause to reioice in all the time of his s●ruice, then with better cōtentation might he abyde grief than I, who hauing tasted of the delight which I did secretly cōceiue of his deserts, do think ech grief a present death by the remembrance of those forepassed thoughts: &amp; lesse wrong séemeth it to be destitut of the thing which was neuer obteyned, than to be depriued of a iewell whereof we haue bin already possessed: so that vnder your correction <pb n="267" xml:id="ep000826-116-b"/>I might cōclude, that greater hath bin my grief &amp; iniury susteined, than that of the Knight. To whom F.I. replied, as touching delight, it may not be denied but that euery louer doth take delight in the inward cōtemplacion of his mind, to think of the worthines of his beloued, &amp; therfore you may not alledge that the Knight had neuer cause to reioice, vnlesse you will altogither cōdempne your self of vnworthines: Mary if you will say that he tasted not the delights that louers séeke, then mark, who was the cause but your self? And if you would accuse him of like ingratitude, for that he disdained you in the latter vii. yeres, whē as he might by accepting your loue, haue recōpenced him self of all former wrongs you must remēber ther withal, that the crueltie by you shewed towards him was such, that could by no meanes perceiue that your chaūge procéeded of good will, but rather eftsones to hold him enchained in vnknown links of subtil dealings, &amp; therfore not without cause he douted you: &amp; yit without cause you reiected him. He had oftē sought occasion, but by your refusals he could neuer find him: you hauing occasiō fast by the foretop did dally with him so long, til at last he slipped his head from you, &amp; then catching at the bald nodd●e, you foūd your self the cause, &amp; yit you would accuse another. To cōclude, greater is the grief that is susteined without desert, and much more is the wrong that is offred without cause. Thus <hi>F. I. </hi>decided the question propounded by Pergo, &amp; expected that some other Dame should propoūd another: but his mistres (hauing hir hand on another halfpeny) gan thus say vnto him. Seruant this pastime is good, and such as I must néeds like of, to driue away your pensiue thoughts: but sléeping time approcheth, &amp; I feare we disquiet you, wherefore the rest of this time we will (if so like you) bestowe in trimming vp your bed and to morrow we shall méete here and renew this new begon game with Madame Pergo. Mistres (<abbr>qd </abbr>
          <hi>F. I.</hi>) I must obey your will, and most humbly thanke you of your great goodnesse, and <pb n="268" xml:id="ep000826-117-a"/>all these Ladies for their curtesie: Euen so, requiring you that you will no further trouble your selues about me, but let my seruaunt alone with conducting me to bed. Yes seruaunt (quod she) I wil sée if you can sléepe any better in my shéetes: and therewith commaunded hir handmayd to fetch a paire of cleane shéetes, the which béeing brought (maruailous fine and swéete) the Ladies Fraunces and Elyn●r did curteously vnfold them, and layd them on the bed, which done, they also entreated <hi>F. I. </hi>to vncloth him and go to bed: being layd, his Mistres dressed and couched the clothes about him, sithens moistened his temples with rosewater, gaue him handkerchewes and other fresh linnen about him, in dooing wherof, she whispered in his eare, saying: Seruaunt, this night I will bée with thée, and after with the rest of the Dames gaue him good night and departed, leauing <hi>F. I. </hi>in a traunce betwene hope and dispayre, trust and mistrust. Thus he lay rauished, commaunding his seruaunt to goe to bed, and fayning that himself would assay if he could sléepe. About ten or eleauē of the clock came his Mistresse in hir night gowne, who knowing all priuy wayes in that house very perfectly, had conueied hir self into <hi>F. I. </hi>chamber, vnséene and vnperceyued, and being nowe come vnto his beds side knéeled down, and laying hir arme ouer him sayed these or like wordes: My good Seruaunt, if thou knewest what perplexities I suffer in beholding of thine infirmities, it might then suffise, eyther vtterly to dryue away thy mallady, or much more to augment thy griefs: for I know thou louest me, and I think also that thou hast had sufficient profe of myne vnfained good will, in remembrance whereof, I fall into sundry passions: First, I compt the happy lots of our first acquaintance, and therin I call to mynde the equalitie of our affections, for I think that there were neuer two louers conioyned with fréeer consent on both parties: and if my ouerhasty deliuery <pb n="269" xml:id="ep000826-117-b"/>of yéelding words be not wrested hereafter to my condempnacion, I can then assure my self to escape for euer without desert of any reprofe: herewithall I can not forget the sundry aduentures happened since we became one hart deuided in two bodies, all which haue ben both happily atchieued, and delectably enioyed: what resteth then to consider but this thy present state? The first corosiue that I haue felt, and the last cordiall that I looke for, the end of my ioyes, and the beginning of my torments, and hereat hir salt teares gan bathe the dying lips of hir seruaunt: who hearing these wordes, and well considering hir demeanor, began now to accuse him selfe of such and so haynous treason, as that his gilty harte was constreined to yéelde vnto a iust scourge for the same. Hée swooned vnder hir arme: the which when she perceyued, it were hard to tel what feares did most affright hir. But I haue heard my friend <hi>F. I. </hi>cōfesse, that he was in a happy traunce, and thought himself for diuers causes vnhappely reuiued. For surely I haue heard him affirme, that to dye in such a passion▪ had ben rather pleasant, than like to panges of death. It were hard now to rehearse how hée was reuiued, since there wer none present, but he dying, (who could not declare) &amp; she liuing, who wold not disclose so much as I meane to bewray. For my friēd F.I. hath to me emported, that returning to life, the first thing which he felt, was that his good mistres lay pressing his with the whole weight of hir body, and biting his lips with hir friendly téeth: and peraduenture shée refrayned (either of curtesie towards him, or for womanish feare, to hurt hir tender hand) to strik him on the chéekes in such sorte, as they doe that striue to call agayne a dying creature: and therefore thought this the aptest meane to reduce him vnto remembrance. F.I. now awaked, could no lesse do, than of his curteous nature receyue his Mistresse into his bed: Who, as one that knew that waye better, than <pb n="270" xml:id="ep000826-118-a"/>how to help his swooning, gan gently strip of hir clothes, and louingly embracing him, gan demaund of him in this sorte. Alas good Seruaunt (quod she) what kinde of maladie is this that so extréemely doth torment thée? F.I. with faynting spéech aunswered: Mistresse, as for my maladie, it hath ben easely cured by your bountifull medicines applied: But I must confesse, that in receiuing that guerison at your handes, I haue ben constreined to fall into an Extasie, through the galding remembrance of myne own vnworthines: Neuerthelesse good Mistresse, since I perceiue such fidelitie remayning betwene vs, as that fewe wordes will perswade such trust as louers ought to embrace, let these fewe wordes suffise to craue your pardon, and doe eftsoones powre vpon me (your vnworthy seruaunt) the haboundant waues of your accustomed clemency: for I must confesse, that I haue so highly offended you, as (but your goodnesse surpasse the malice of my conceipts) I must remayne (and that right woorthely) to the seuere punishment of my desertes: and so should you but loose him who hath cast away him self, and neither can accuse you, nor dare excuse him selfe of the crime. Dame Elynor, who had rather haue found hir seruaunt perfectly reuiued, than thus with straunge conceipts encombred: and musing much at his darke spéech, became importunat to know the certainty of his thoughts. And F.I. as one not maister of him selfe, gan at the last playnly confesse howe he had mistrusted the chaunge of hir vowed affections: Yea and (that more was) he playnly expressed with whom, of whom, by whom, and too whom shée bent hir better liking. </p>
        <p>Now, here I would demaund of you and such other as are expert: Is there any geater impediment to the fruition of a Louers delights, than to be mistrusted? or rather, is it not the ready way to race all loue and former <pb n="271" xml:id="ep000826-118-b"/>good will out of remembrance, to tell a gilty mynd that you doe mistrust it? It should séeme yes, by Dame Elynor, who began nowe to take the matter whottely, and of such vehemency were hir fancies, that shée nowe fell into flat defiance with <hi>F. I. </hi>who although hée sought by many faire wordes to temper hir chollerike passions, and by yeelding him selfe to ●et the conquest of an other, yet could hée by no meanes determine the quarrell. The softe pillowes being present at all these whot wordes, put forth themselues as mediatours for a truce betwene these enemies, and desired that (if they would néedes fight) it might be in their presence but onely one pusshe of the pike, and so from thenceforth to become friends again for euer. But the Dame denied flatly, alleadging that shée found no cause at all to vse such curtesie vnto such a re●reant, adding further many wordes of great reproche: the which did so encourage <hi>F. I. </hi>as that hauing now forgotten all former curtesies, he drewe vppon his new pr●fessed enimie, and bare hir vp with such a violence against the bolster, that before shée could prepare the warde, he thrust hir through both hands, and &amp;c. wherby the Dame swoning for feare, was constreyned (for a time) to abandon hir body to the enemies curtesie. At last when shée came to hir selfe, shée rose sodeinly and determined to saue hir selfe by flight, leauing <hi>F. I. </hi>with many dispytefull wordes, and swearing that hee should neuer (eftsoones) take hir at the like aduātage, the which othe she kept better than hir former professd good will: and hauing nowe recouered hir chamber (bicause shee founde hir hurt to be nothing daungerous) I doubt not, but shee slept quietly the rest of the night: As <hi>F. I. </hi>also perswading himselfe that hée should with conuenient leysure recouer hir from this hagger conceipt, tooke some better rest towardes the morning, than hee had done in many nights forepast. So let them both slèepe whyles <pb n="272" xml:id="ep000826-119-a"/>I turne my penne vnto the before named Secretary, who being (as I sayd) come lately from London, had made many proffers to renew his accustomed consultations: but the sorrow which his Mistresse had conceyued in F.I. his sicknesse, togither with hir continuall repayre to him during the same, had ben such lettes vnto his attempts, at is was long time before he could obtayne audience. </p>
        <p>At the last these newe accidentes fell so fauourably for the furtherance of his cause, that he came to his Mistresse presence, and there pleaded for himselfe. Nowe, if I should at large write his allegations, togither with hir subtile aunsweres, I should but comber your eares with vnpleasaunt rehearsall of feminine frayeltie. </p>
        <p>To be short, the late disdayneful moode which she had cōceyued against F.I. togither with a scrupule which lay in hir cōscience, touching the xi. article of hir beléeue, moued hir presently with better will to cōsult with this Secretary, aswel vpon a spéedy reueng of hir late receiued wrōgs as also vpon the reformation of hir religion. And in very déed, it fell out that the Secretary hauing bin of long time absēt, &amp; therby his quils &amp; pēnes not worn so néer as they were wont to be, did now prick such faire large notes, that his Mistres liked better to sing faburden vnder him, thā to descant any longer vppon <hi>F. I. </hi>playne song: and thus they continued in good accorde, vntill it fortuned that Dame Fraunces came into hir chamber vppon such sodeyn as shée had like to haue marred all the musick. Wel thei cōueied their clifs as closely as they could, but yit not altogither without some suspiciō giuen to the said dame Fraūces, who although shée could baue bin content to take any payn in F.I. behalf, yit otherwise she would neuer haue bestowed the watching about so wortheles a prise. After womāly salutacions they fel into sundry discourses, the Secretaty stil abyding in the chāber with them. At last two or <pb n="273" xml:id="ep000826-119-b"/>thrée other gentlewomē of the Castle came into Madam Elynors chamber, who after their <hi>Bon iour </hi>did all <foreign xml:lang="lat">(vna voce</foreign>) séeme to lament the sicknes of F.I. and called vpon the Dames Elinor and Fraunces, to go visite him againe. The Lady Fraunces curteously consented, but Madame Elinor first alledged that she hir selfe was also sickly, the which she attributed to hir late paynes taken about <hi>F. I. </hi>and sayd that onely for that cause she was constrayned to kepe hir bed longer than hir accustomed hower. The Dames (but especially the Lady Fraunces) gan streight waies coniecture some great cause of sodaine change, and so leauing dame Elynor, walked altogether into the parke to take the ayre of the morning: And as they thus walked it chaūced that Dame Pergo heard a Cuckoe chaunt, who (because the pride of the spring was now past) cried Cuck cuck Cuckoe in hir stameringe voyce. A ha (quod Pergo) this foule byrd begines to flye the countrie, and yet before hir departure, sée how spitefully she can deuise to salute vs. Not vs (quod Dame Fraunces) but some other whom she hath espyed: wherewith Dame Pergo looking round about hir, and espying none other company sayd. Why here is no body but we few womē <abbr>qd </abbr>she. Thanks be to God the house is not farre from vs (quod Dame Fraunces.) Here at the wylie Pergo partely perceyuing Dame Fraunces meaning replyed on this sort: I vnderstand you not (quod she) but to leape out of this matter, shall we go visite Maister <hi>F. I. </hi>and sée how he doth this morning? Why quod dame Fraunces, do you suppose that the Cuckoe called vnto him? Nay marry quod Pergo, for (as farre as I know) he is not maried. As who should say (quod Dame Fraunces,) that the Cuckoe enuieth none but maryed folkes. I take it so sayd Pergo: the Lady Fraunces aunswered. Yes suer I haue noted as euill lucke in loue (after the cuckoes call) to haue happened vnto diuers vnmaried folkes, as euer I did vnto the maried: but I can <pb n="274" xml:id="ep000826-120-a"/>be well content that we go vnto Master. I. for I promised on the behalfe of vs al, that we wold vse our best deuoyre to recomfort him vntill he had recouered health, and I do much meruayle that the Lady Elinor is now become so vnwilling to take any trauayle in his behalfe, especially remembring that but yesternigh she was so diligent to bring him to bed, but I perceyue that all earthly thinges are subiect vnto change. Euen so they be quod Pergo, for you may behold the trées which but euen this other daye were clad in gladsome gréene, and now their leaues begin to fa●e and change colour. Thus they passed talking and walking vntill they returned vnto the Castle, whereas they went straight vnto F.I. chamber, &amp; found him in bed: why how now Trust (quod Dame Fraunces,) w●ll it be no better? Yes shortly I hope quod F.I. The Ladies all saluted him &amp; he gaue them the gramercy: at the last Pergo popped this question vnto him. And howe haue you slept in your Mistres shéetes Master <hi>F. I. </hi>quod she? reasonable well quod <hi>F. I. </hi>but I pray you where is my Mistresse this morning? Mary sayd Pergo, wee left hir in bed scarce well at ease. I am the more sorye quod <hi>F. I. </hi>Why Trust (sayd Mistresse Fraunces) be of good comforte, and assure your selfe that here are others who would be as glad of your wel doing, as your Mistresse in any respect. I ought not to doubt therof (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) hauing the proofe that I haue had of your great curtesies, but I thought it my dutie to aske for my Mistresse being absent. Thus they passed some time with him vntill they were called away vnto prayers, and that being finished they went to dinner, where they met Dame Elynor attired in a night kerchief after the soolenest (the solempnest fashion I should haue sayed,) who loked very drowsely vpon all folkes vnlesse it were hir secretary, vnto whom she deigned sometime to lend a fréendly glaunce. The Lord of the Castle demaunded of hir howe F.I. did this <pb n="275" xml:id="ep000826-120-b"/>morning. She answered that she knew not, for she had not séene him that day. You may do wel then daughter (<abbr>qd </abbr>the Lord) to go now vnto him, &amp; to assay if he wil eate any thing, &amp; if here be no meates that like him, I pray you commaund (for him) any thing that is in my house. You must pardon me sir (quod she,) I am sickly disposed, and would be loth to take the ayre: why then go you Mistres Fraunce (quod he) and take some body with you: and I charge you sée that he lacke nothing. Mistresse Fraunces was glad of the ambassade, &amp; arysing from the table with one other gentlewoman, toke with hir a dishe of chickins boyled in white broth, saying to hir father: I thinke this meate méetest for Master I. of any that is here. It is so (qoud he) daughter, and if he like not that, cause somewhat els to be dressed for him according to his apetite. Thus she departed and came to <hi>F. I. </hi>who being plonged in sundry woes and thrilled with restlesse thoughtes, was now beginning to aryse: but seing the Dames, couched downe againe, and sayd vnto them. Alas fayre Ladies you put your selues to more paynes than eyther I do desire, or can deserue. Good Trust quod Dame Fraunces, our paines are no greater than dutie requireth, nor yet so great as we could vouchsafe in your behalfe, and presently my father hath sent vs vnto you (quod she) with this pittaunce, and if your apetite desire any one thing more than other, wée are to desire likewise that you will not refrayne to call for it. Oh my good Hope (quod hée) I perceiue that I shall not dye as longe as you maye make mée liue. And being nowe somedeale recomforted with the remembraunce of his Mistres words which shée hadde vsed ouer night at hir first comming, and also thinkinge that although shée parted in choller, it was but iustly prouoked by him selfe, and that at leasure hée shoulde fyn●e some salue for that soore also: hée determyned to take the comforte of his assured Hope, <pb n="276" xml:id="ep000826-121-a"/>and so to expell all venomnes of mistrust before receyued: wherfore raysing him selfe in his bed, he cast a night gowne about his shoulders saying: It shall neuer be sayd that my faynting hart can reiect the comfortable Cordialles of so fréendly phisitions. Nowe by my troth well sayed gentle Trust quod Dame Fraunces, and in so doing assure your selfe of guerison with spéed. This thus sayed, the curteous Dame became his keruer, &amp; hée with a bold spirite gan tast of hir cookery, but the late conflicts of his conceipts had so disaquainted his stomack from repastes, that he could not well away with meate: and yet neuerthelesse by little &amp; little receyued some nouryture. When his Hope had crammed him as long as she coulde make him féede, they deliuered the rest to the other gentlewoman, who hauing not dyned, fell to hir prouander. In which meane while the Lady Fraunces had much cōfortable spéech with F.I. and declared that she perceyued very well the cause of his malladie, but my Trust (quod she) be all whole, and remember what I foretold you in the beginning: neuerthelesse you must thinke that there are remedies for all mischiefes, and if you wilbe ruled by myne aduise, we will soone find the meane to ease you of this mishap. <hi>F. I. </hi>toke comforte in hir discretion, and fréendly kissing hir hand, gaue hir a cartlode of thankes for hir great good will, promising to put to his vttermost force, and euermore to be ruled by hir aduise. Thus they passed the dynner while, the Ladie Fraunces alwayes refusing to declare hir conceipt of the late change which she perceyued in his Mistresse, for shée thought best first to wynne his will vnto conformitie by little and little, and then in the end to persuade him with necessitie. When the other gentlewoman had vytayled hir, they departed, requiring F.I. to arise and boldly to resist the fayntnesse of his feuer, the which he promised and so bad them a Di●. The Ladyes at their returne found the courte in Dame <pb n="277" xml:id="ep000826-121-b"/>Elynors chamber, who had there assembled hir secretary, Dam Pergo, and the rest: there they passed an hower or twayne in sundry discourses, wherin Dame Pergo did alwaies cast out some bone for Mistresse Fraunces to gnaw vppon, for that in déede she perceyued hir harty affection towardes <hi>F. I</hi>: whereat Mistresse Fraunces changed no countenaunce, but reserued hir reuenge vntill a better oportunitie. At last (quod Dame Fraunces vnto Mistresse Elinor) and when will you go vnto your seruaunt fayre Lady? When he is sicke and I am whole quod Dame Elynor. That is euen now quod the other, for how sicke hée is your self can witnesse: and how well you are we must beare record. You may aswel be deceiued in my disposition (quod Dame Elynor) as I was ouerséene in his sodain alteration, and if he be sicke you are méetest to be his phisition: for you sawe yesterday that my paines did little profite towardes his recōfort. Yes surely sayd the other, not onely I but all the rest had occasiō to iudge that your curtesie was his chiefe comfort. Well quod Dame Elinor you know not what I know. Nor you what I think quod Dame Fraunces. Thinke what you list quod Elynor. In déede quod Fraunces I may not thinke that you care, neither will I die for your pleasure: and so halfe angry shée departed. At supper they met againe, and the Maister of the house demaūded of his daughter Fraunces how F.I. did? Sir (quod she) he did eate somewhat at dinner, and sithens I saw him not. The more to blame quod he, and now I would haue al you gentlewomen take of the best meates and go suppe with him: for company driueth away carefulnesse, and leaue you me here with your leauinges alone. Nay sir quod Mistresse Elynor, I pray you giue me leaue to beare you company, for I dare not aduenture thither. The Lord of the Castle was contented &amp; dispatched away the rest: who taking with them such vyandes as they thought méetest, went vnto F.I. chamber, <pb n="278" xml:id="ep000826-122-a"/>fynding him vp, and walking about to recouer strength, whereat Dame Fraunces reioysed, and declared how hir father had sent that company to attend him at supper. <hi>F. I. </hi>gaue great thankes, and missing now nothing but his Mistresse, thought not good yet to aske for hir, but because he partly gessed the cause of hir absence, he contented him selfe, hoping that when his lure was newe garnished, he shoulde easely reclayme hir from those coye conceiptes. They passed ouer their supper all in quiet, and sone after Mistresse Fraunces, being desirous to requite Dame Pergoes quippes, requested that they might continue the pastime which Dame Pergo had begon ouer night: whereunto they all consented, and the lot fell vnto Dame Fraunces to propounde the second question, who adressing hir spéeche vnto <hi>F. I. </hi>sayde in this wyse. Noble gouernor, I will reherse vnto you a straūge historie, not fayned, neither borowed out of any olde aucthoritie, but a thing done in déede of late daies, and not farre distant from this place where wee nowe remayne. It chaunced that a gentleman our neighbour being maried to a very fayre gentlewoman, liued with hir by the space of fower or fiue yeares in great contentation, trusting hir no lesse than he loued hir, and yet louing hir as much as any man coulde loue a woman. On that otherside the gentlewoman hadde woon (vnto hir beautie) a singular commendation for hir chast and modest behauiour. Yet it happened in time that a lustie younge gentleman (who very often resorted to them) obtayned that at hir handes▪ which neuer any man coulde before him attayne: and to be playne, he woon so much in hir affections, that forgetting both hir owne dutie and hir husbandes kindnes, she yéelded hir body at the commaundement of this louer, in which pastime they passed long time by their polliticks gouernement. At last the friendes of this Lady (and especially thrée sisters which she had) espied ouermuch familiaritie <pb n="279" xml:id="ep000826-122-b"/>betwene the two louers, and dreading least it might breake out to their cōmon reproch toke their sister apart, and declared that the worlde did iudge scarce well of the repayre of that gentleman vnto hir house: and that if she did not foresée it in time, she shoulde not onely leese the good credite which she hir selfe had hitherto possessed, but furthermore should distayne their whole race with common obloquy and reproch. These and sundry other godly admonitions of these sisters could not sinke in the mind of this gentlewoman, for she did not onely stand in defiaunce what any man coulde thinke of hir, but also séemed to accuse them, that because they saw hir estimation (being their yonger) to growe aboue their owne, they had therfore deuised this meane to set variance betwene hir husbande and hir. The sisters séeing their holesome counsell so reiected, and hir continue still in hir obstinate opinion, adressed their spéech vnto hir husbande, declaring that the worlde iudged not the best, neyther they themselues did very wel like of the familiaritie betwene their sister and that gentleman, and therfore aduised him to forecast all perils, and in time to forbid him his house. The husband (on that otherside) had also conceyued such a goo● opinion of his gest, &amp; had growen into such a stricte famyliaritie with him, that you might with more ease haue remoued a stone wall, than once to make him thinke amisse, eyther of his wyfe, or of hir louer: Yea and immediately after this conference he would not sticke thus to say vnto his wyfe. Besse: (for so in dée●e was hir name) thou hast thrée such busie bray●ed si●ters, as I thincke shortly their heads will breake: they woulde haue me to bée tellous of thée, no no Besse &amp;c. so that hee was not onely farre from any such beliefe, but furthermore dyd euery day encrease his curtesies towardes the louer. The sisters being thus on all sides reiected, and yet perceiuing more and more an vnseemely behauiour betwene their <pb n="280" xml:id="ep000826-123-a"/>sister and hir miniō, began to melt in their owne grease: and such was their enraged pretēce of reuenge, that they suborned diuers seruants in the house to watch so dilligently, as that this treason might be discouered. Amōgst the rest, one mayde of subtill spirite had so long watched them, that at last she espied them go into a chamber together, and locke the doore to them: whereuppon she ranne with all hast possible to hir Maister, and tolde him that if he would come with hir, shée woulde shewe him a very straunge sight. The gentleman (suspectinge nothinge) went with hir vntill he came into a chamber neare vnto that wherein they had shut themselues, and she poynting hir Maister to the keyhole, bad him looke through, where he sawe the thing which most might mislike him to behold. Where at he sodaynely drewe his Dagger, and turned towardes the mayde, who fled from him for feare of mischiefe: but when he could not ouer take hir in the heat of his choller, he commaunded that she should forthwith trusse vp that little which she had and to depart his seruice: and before hir departure he found meanes to talke with hir, threatening that if euer she spake any word of this mystery in any place where she should come, it shuld cost hir lyfe. The mayde for feare departed in silence, and the Master neuer changed coūtenance eyther to his wife or to hir peramour, but feyned vnto his wyfe that he had turned away the mayde vppon that sodaine, for that shée had throwen a Kitchin knife at him, whyles he went about to correct a fault in hir &amp;c. Thus the good gentleman dranke vp his owne swette vnséene euery day, encreasing curtesie to the louer, and neuer chaunging countenaunce to his wyfe in any thing, but onely that he refrayned to haue such knowlege of hir carnally as he in times past had, and other men haue of their wyues. In this sort he continued by the space all most of halfe a yeare, neuerthelesse lamenting his mishap in sollitary places. At last <pb n="281" xml:id="ep000826-123-b"/>(what moued him I know not) he fell agayn to company with his wife as other men doo, and as I haue heard it saied he vsed this pollicy: euery time that he had knowledge of hir, he would leaue either in the bed, or in hir cusshencloth, or by hir looking glasse, or in some place wher shée must néedes find it, a piece of mony which then was fallen to thrée halfpence: and I remember they called thē Slippes. Thus he dealt with hir continually by the space of foure or fiue monethes, vsing hir neuerthelesse very kindly in all other respectes, &amp; prouiding for hir al things necessary at the first call: But vnto his geast he still augmented his curtesie, in suche sorte, that you would haue thought them to be sworne brothers. Al this notwithstāding his wife much musing at these thrée half peny péeces which she founde in this sorte, and furthermore, hauing sundry times found hir husband in solitarie places making great lamentation, she grew enquisitiue, what should be the secret cause of these alteracions: vnto whō he would none otherwise answere, but that any mā shuld finde occasion to be more pensiue at one time than at another. The wife notwithstanding encreasing hir suspect, emported the same vnto hir louer, alledging therwithall that shée doubted very much least hir husband had some vehement suspiciō of their affaires. The louer encoraged hir, &amp; likewise declared, that if she would be importunate to enquire the cause, hir husband would not be able to kéepe it from hir: and hauing now throughly enstructed hir, she dealt with hir husband in this sorte. One day when shee knew him to be in his study alone, she came in to him, and hauing fast locked the dore after hir, and cōueyed the key into hir pocked, she began first with earnest entreaty, and then with teares to craue that he would no longer kéepe from hir the cause of his sodein alteration. The husband dissimuled the matter still: at last she was so earnest to know for what cause he left money in such sort at sundry <pb n="282" xml:id="ep000826-124-a"/>times, that he aunswered on this wise: Wyfe (quod he) thou knowest how long we haue ben maried togither, &amp; how long I made so deare accompt of thée as euer man made of his wife: since which dayes, thou knowest also how long I refreyned thy company, and how long again I haue vsed thy company leauing the mony in this sorte, and the cause is this. So lōg as thou didst behaue thy self faithfully towards me, I neuer lothed thy company, but sithens I haue perceiued thée to be a harlot, therfore did I for a time refreine and forbeare to lie with thée: &amp; now I can no longer forbeare it, I do giue thée euery time that I lye with thée a slip, which is to make thée vnderstande thine own whordome: and this reward is sufficient for a whore. The wife began stoutly to stand at defiance, but the husband cut off hir spéeche and declared when, where, and how he had séene it: hereat the womā being abashed, and finding hir conscience gilty of asmuch as he had alledged, fel down on hir knées, &amp; with most bitter teares craued pardon, confessing hir offence: whereat hir husband (moued with pitie) &amp; melting likewise in fluds of lamentation, recōforted hir promising that if from that day forwards she would be true vnto him, he wold not only forgiue al that was past, but become more tender &amp; louing vnto hir than euer he was. What do I tary so long? they became of accord: &amp; in full accōplishment therof, the gentlewoman did altogither eschew the company, the speech, &amp; (as much as in hir lay) the sight of hir louer, although hir husband did continue his curtesie to wars him, and often charged his wife to make him fair semblant. The Louer was now onely left in perpleritie, who knewe nothing what might be the cause of all these chaunges, &amp; that most greeued him, he could by no meanes obteyne agayn the spéech of his desired: hee watched all opportunities, hée suborned messangers, he wrote letters, but all in vayne. In the end shée caused to be declared vnto him a time and <pb n="283" xml:id="ep000826-124-b"/>place where she would méete him and speake with him. Being mett, she put him in remembrance of all that had passed betwene them: she layed also before him howe trusty shée had bin vnto him in all professions: she confessed also how faithfully hee had discharged the dutie of a friend in all respects, and therewithall she declared that hir late alteration and pensiuenes of mind was not with out great cause, for that she had of late such a mishap, as might change the disposition of any liuing creature: Yea and that the case was such, as vnlesse she found present remedy, hir death must néedes ensue and that spéedely: for the preuenting whereof, she alledged that she had beaten hir braynes with all deuises possible, and that in the end she could think of no redresse but one, the which lay only in him to accomplishe. Wherfore she besought him for all the loue and good will which passed betwene them, nowe to shew the fruites of true friendship, and to gratifie hir with a frée graunt to this request. The louer who had always ben desirous to pleasure hir in any thing, but now especially to recouer hir woonted kindnesse, gan frankly promise to accōplish any thing that might be to him possible, yea though it were to his great detriment: and therewithall did déepely blame hir in that she would so long torment hir selfe with any grief, considering that it lay in him to helpe it. The Lady aunswered, that she had so long kept it from his knowledge, bycause she doubted whether he would be contented to performe it or not, althogh it was such a thing as he might easely graūt without any maner of hurt to himself: &amp; yit that now in the end she was forced to aduēture vpon his curtesie, being no lōger able to bear the burdē of hir grief the louer solicited hir most earnestly to disclose it: and she (as fast) séemed to mistrust that he would not accōpl●sh it. In the end she tooke out a booke (which shée had brought for the no●ce) and bound him by oth to accōplish it. The louer mistrusting nothing <pb n="284" xml:id="ep000826-125-a"/>lesse than that ensued, tooke the othe willingly: which don she declared al that had passed betwene hir &amp; hir husband: his grief, hir repentance, his pardon, hir vow, &amp; in the ende of hir tale enioined the louer, that frō thenceforthwards, he should neuer attempt to break hir cōstant determination: the louer replied that this was vnpossible: but shée plainly assured him, that if he graūted hir that request, she would be his friend in all honest &amp; godly wise: if not, shée put him out of doubt that she would eschew his cōpany &amp; flie from his sight as from a scorpion. The louer considering that hir request was but iust, accusing his own gilty conscience, remembring the great curtesies always vsed by hir husband, &amp; therwithal séeing the case now brought to such an issue, as that by none other meanes than by this it could be conceiled frō knowledge of the world: but most of all, being vrged by his oth, did at last giue an vnwilling consent, &amp; yit a faithful promise to yéeld vnto hir wil in al things: and thus being become of one assēt, he remaineth the dearest friend &amp; most welcome gest that may be, both to the Lady &amp; hir husband, and the man &amp; wife so kind (ech to other) as if there neuer had bin such a breache betwene them. Now, of you noble Gouernor I would fayn learn, whether the perplexitie of the husband when he looked in at the key hole, or of the wife when she knewe the cause why the slippes were so scattered, or of the louer when he knew what was his Mistres charge, was greater of the thrée? I might haue put in also the troubled thoughts of the sisters &amp; the mayd, when they sawe their good will reiected, but let these thrée suffise. Gentle Hope (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) you haue rehearsed (&amp; that right eloquētly) a notable tale, or rather a notable history, bycause you séeme to affirme, that it was don in déed of late, &amp; not far hence. Wherein I note fiue especiall pointes: that is a maruelous pacience in the husband, no lesse repentance in the wyfe, no small boldnesse of the mayd, but much more rashnesse in the sisters, <pb n="285" xml:id="ep000826-125-b"/>and last of all, a rare tractabilitie in the louer. Neuerthelesse to returne vnto your question, I think the husbands perplexitie greatest, bicause his losses abounded aboue the rest, &amp; his iniuries were vncōparable. The Lady Fraunces did not séeme to contrary him, but rather smyled in hir sléeue at Dame Pergo, who had no lesse patience to heare the tale recited, than the Lady Fraūces had pleasure in telling of it, but I may not rehearse the cause why, vnlesse I shuld tell all. By this time the sléeping houre aproched, &amp; the Ladies prepared their departure, when as mistres Fraūces said vnto F.I. Although percase I shal not do it so handsomly as your mistres, yit good Trust (quod she) if you vouchsafe it, I can be content to trim vp your bed in the best maner that I may, as one who would be as glad as she to procure your quiet rest. I.F. gaue hir gret thāks desiring hir not to trouble hirself, but to let his mā alone with that charge: thus they departed, and how all parties tooke rest that night I know not: but in the morning F.I. began to cōsider w t himself that he might lye long enough in his bed before his mistres would be apeased in hir péewish cōceipts: wherfore he arose, &amp; being aparelled in his night gown, tooke occasion to walk in the gallery néer adioyning vnto his Mistres chāber: but ther might he walk long enough ere his mistres would come to walk with him. When dinner time came he wēt into the great chamber wheras the Lord of the castle saluted him being ioyful of his recouery. F.I. giuing dewe thanks, declared that his frendly entretainement togither with the great curtesie of the gentlewomē was such, as might reuiue a mā althogh he were half dead. I would be loth (<abbr>qd </abbr>the hoste) that any gentlemā cōming to me for good wil shuld want any curtesie of entertainmēt that lieth in my power. Whē the meat was serued to the table, the gentlewomē came in all but Dame Elynor &amp; mistres Pergo, the which F.I. marked very well, &amp; it did somewhat abate his apetit. After dinner, <pb n="286" xml:id="ep000826-126-a"/>his Hope came vnto him and demaunded of him howe hée would passe the day for his recreation? to whom he aunswered euen as it best pleased hir. She deuised to walke into the park, &amp; so by little &amp; litle to acquaint himself with the ayre: he agréed, &amp; they walked togither being accōpanied with one or two other gentlewomē. Here (least you shuld grow in some wrong cōceit of F.I.) I must put you out of dout, that although ther were now more cause that he shuld mistrust his mistres than euer he had before receiued, yit the vehemēt passions which he saw in hir whē the first came to visit him, &amp; moreouer, the earnest words which she pronoūced in his extremity, were such a refreshing to his mind, as that he determined no more to trouble himself with like conceipts: cōcluding further, that if his mistres wer not faulty, thē had he cōmittted a foule offēce in néedlesse ielousie, &amp; that if she were faulty (especially with the Secretary) thē no persuasion could amend hir, nor any passion help him: and this was the cause that enabled him after such passing pangs to abyde the doubtfull conclusion, thus manfully and valiātly to represse feintnesse of his mind: nothing doubting but that he should haue wonne his Mistres to pardon his presumption, &amp; louingly to embrace his seruice in wonted maner, but he was far deceyued, for she was now in another tewne, the which Mistres Fraūces began partly to discouer vnto him as they walked togither: for shée burdened him that his mallady procéeded only of a disquiet mind. And if it did so my gentle Hope (quod he) what remedy? My good Trust (quod she) none other but to plant quiet where disquiet began to grow. I haue determined so (<abbr>qd </abbr>he) but I must craue the helpe of your assured friēship. Therof you may make accoūpt (<abbr>qd </abbr>she) but wherin? F.I. walking apart with hir, begā to declare that ther was some contētion hapened betwene his mistres &amp; him: the Lady told him that she was not ignorant therof. Thē he desired hir to treat so much in the cause, <pb n="287" xml:id="ep000826-126-b"/>as they might eftsones come to Parlee: therof I dare assure you (<abbr>qd </abbr>Mistresse Fraunces, &amp; at their retorne she led F.I. into his Mistres chamber, whom thei found lying on hir bed, whether galded with any grief, or weary of the thing (which you wrot of) I know not, but there she lay: vnto whō F.I. gaue two or thrée salutatiōs before she séemed to mark him. At last said the Lady Fraunces vnto hir, your seruant hearing of your sicknes, hath aduētured thus far into the ayre to sée you. I thank him (<abbr>qd </abbr>Dame Elynor) &amp; so lay still, refusing to giue him any coūtenāce. Wherat <hi>F. I. </hi>perceyuing al the other gentlewomen fal to whispering, thought good, boldly to plead his own case: &amp; aproching the bed begā to enforce his vnwilling mistres vnto curtesie, wherin he vsed such vehemēce as she could not well by any meanes refuse to talke with him: but what their talk was I may not take vpō me to tell you, vnlesse you woul● haue me fill vp a whole volume only with his matters, and I haue dilated thē ouer largely already. Suffyseth this to be knowne, that in the ende shee pretended to passe ouer all old grudges, &amp; thenceforth to pleasure him as accasion might serue: the which occasion was so long in hapening, that in the end F.I. being now eftsones troubled with vnquiet fantasies, &amp; forced to vse his pen again as an Ambassadour betwene thē: one daye amongst the rest found oportunitie to thrust a letter into hir bosome, wherin he had earnestly requested another mooneshyne banquet or frydayes breakfast to recomfort his dulled spirits, wherunto the Dame yéelded this aunswer in writing, but of whose endyting iudge you. </p>

And it happened one day amongst others, that he resorted to his Mistresse chamber &amp; found hir (<foreign xml:lang="lat">allo solito</foreign>) lying vpon hir bed, &amp; the secretary with Dame Pergo &amp; hir handmayd keping of hir cōpany. Wherat F.I. somwhat repyning, came to hir and fell to dalliāce, as one that had now rather aduēture to be thought presumptious than yéeld to be accompted bashfull, he cast his arme ouer his Mistresse and began t● accuse hir of slogishnes, vsing some other bold partes, as well to prouoke hir, as also to gréeue the other. The Lady séemed little to delight in his dallying, but cast a glance at hir secretary and therwith smyled, when as the Secretary &amp; dame Pergo burst out into open laughter. The which F.I. perceyuing, and disdayning hir ingratitude, was forced to depart, and in that fantasie compyled this Sonet. </p>

        <p>THis Sonet declareth that he began nowe to accompt of hir as she deserued, for it hath a sharpe conclusion, and it is somewhat too generall. Wel, as it is he lost it where his Mistresse found it, and she immediatly emparted the same vnto Dame Pergo, and Dame Pergo vnto others: so that it quickely became common in the house. Amongst others Mistresse Fraunces hauing recouered a copie of it, did séeme to pardon the generallitie, and to be well pleased with the perticularitie therof, the which she bewrayed one day vnto F.I. in this wise. Of all the ioyes that euer I had (my good Trust quod she) there is none wherein I take more comforte than in your comformitie, and although your present rage is such that you can bée content to condemne a nomber vnknowen, for the transgression of one too well knowne: yet I do rather reioyce that you should iudge your pleasure ouer many, than to be abused by any. My good Hope (quod he) it were not reason that after such manifold proofes of your exceding curtesies, I should vse straunge or contentious spéech with so deare a friend, and in déede I must confesse that the opinion which I haue conceiued of my Mistresse, hath stirred my penne to write very hardly against all the feminine gender, but I pray you pardon me (quod he) &amp; if it please y●u I wil recant ●●tas also (percase) I was but ●loyed with Surquedry, and presumed to think more than may be proued. Yea but how if it were proued quod Dame Fraunces? If it were so (which God forbid quod he) then coulde you not blame me to conceiue that opinion. Howsoeuer I might blame you (quod she) I meane not to blame you, but I demaund further, if it be as I thinke &amp; you suspect, what will you then do? Surely (quod <hi>F. I.</hi>) I haue deter●ed to drinke vp mine owne sorowe secretely, and to bid them both a Dieu. I like your farewell better than your fantasie (quod she) and whensoeuer you can be content to take so much paynes, as the Knight (which had a night <pb n="291" xml:id="ep000826-128-b"/>gowne garded with naked swordes) dyd take, I thinke you may put your selfe out of doubt of all these thinges. By these wordes and other spéech which she vttered vnto him, F.I. smelt how the world went about, and therfore did one day in the grey morning aduēture to passe through the gallery towards his Mistres chamber, hoping to haue found the doore open, but he found the contrary, and there attending in good deuocion, heard the parting of his Mistresse and hir Secretary, with many kind words: wherby it appeared that the one was very loth to departe from the other. F.I. was enforced to beare this burden, and after he had attended there as long as the light wold giue him leaue, he departed also to his chamber, and aparaling himselfe, could not be quiet vntill he had spoken with his Mistresse, whom he burdened flatly with this despitefull trechery: and she as fast denied it, vntill at last being still vrged with such euident tokens as he alleged, she gaue him this bone to g●awe vppon. And if I did so (quod she) what than? Whereunto F.I. made none answere, but departed with this farewell. <hi>My losse is mine owne, and your gayne is none of yours, and soner can I recouer my losse than you enioye the gaine which you gape after. </hi>And whan he was in place sollitary, he compyled these following for a fynall end of the matter. </p>

Nowe, although there wanted no delicate viands to content them, yit their chief repast was by entreglancing of lookes. For G. G. being stoong with hot affection, could none otherwise relie●e his passion but by gazing. And the Dame of a curteous enclinatiō deigned (now and then) to requite the same with glancing at him. Hir old louer occupied his eyes with watching: and hir brother perceyuing all this could not absteyne from winking, wherby he might put his Sister in remēbrāce, least she should too much forget hirself. But most of all hir husband beholding the first, and being euill pleased with the second, scarse contented with the third, and misconstruing the fourth, was constreyned to play the fifth part in froward frowninge. This royall banquet thus passed ouer, G.G. knowing that after supper they should passe the tyme in propounding of Riddles, and making of purposes: contryued all this conceipt in a Riddle as followeth. The which was no sooner pronounced, but she could perfectly perceyue his intent, and draue out one nayle with another, as also enseweth. </head>

          <l>For where should we our lessons learne, but out of holy writte? </l>
          <l>First marke our only God, which ruleth all the rost, </l>
          <l>He sets a side all pompe and pride, wherein fond wordlings boast, </l>
          <l>He is not fedde with calues, as in the dayes of old, </l>
          <l>He cares but litle for their copes, that glister all of gold. </l>
          <l>His traine is not so great, as filthy Sathans band, </l>
          <l>A smaller heard may serue to féede, at our great masters hande. </l>
          <l>He likes no numbred prayers, to purchase popish méede, </l>
          <l>He askes no more but penitence, thereof <hi>Cur Lorde hath neede</hi>: </l>
          <l>Next marke the heathens Gods, and by them shall we sée, </l>
          <l>They be not now so good fellowes, as they were wont to be. </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Ioue, Mars</hi>, and Mercurie, Dame Venus and the rest, </l>
          <l>They banquet not as they were wont, they know it were not best: </l>
          <l>They shrinke into the cloudes, and there they serue out néede, </l>
          <l>As planets and signes moueable, by destenies decréede. </l>
          <l>So kings and princes both, haue lefte their halles at large, </l>
          <l>Their priuie chambers cost enough, they cut off euery charge: </l>
          <l>And when an office falles, as chance sometimes may be, </l>
          <l>First kéepe it close a yere or twayne, then geld it by the sée. </l>
          <l>And giue it out at last, but yet with this prouiso, </l>
          <l>(A bridle for a brainsicke Iade) <foreign xml:lang="lat">durante bene placito</foreign>. </l>
          <l>Some think these ladders low, to climbe alofte with spéede: </l>

          <l>A field bed in a corner coucht, a pallad on the floure. </l>
          <l>But what for that? no force, they make thereof no boast, </l>
          <l>They féede themselues with delycates, and at the princes cost. </l>
          <l>And as for all their men, their pages and their swaynes, </l>

          <l>And why? oh sir, because, both dukes &amp; lords haue néede, </l>
          <l>I mock not I, my text is true, beléeue it as your créede. </l>
          <l>Our prelates and our priests, can tell this text with me, </l>
          <l>They can hold fast their fattest fermes, and let no lease go frée. </l>
          <l>They haue both wife and childe, which may not be forgot, </l>
          <l>The scriptures say <hi>the Lord hath neeed</hi>, &amp; therfore blame thē not. </l>
          <l>Then come a litle lower, vnto the countrey knight, </l>
          <l>The squier and the gentleman, they leaue the countrey quite, </l>
          <l>Their halles were all to large, their tables were to long, </l>

          <l>And welcome there that will, but shall I tell you how? </l>

          <l>Side bords be laid aside, the tables end is gone, </l>

          <l>TO binde a bushe of thornes amongst swete smelling floures, </l>
          <l>May make the posie séeme the worse, and yet the fault is ours. </l>

          <l>For throw away the thorne, and marke what will ensew, </l>
          <l>The posie then will shew it selfe, swéete, faire, and freshe of hew. </l>
          <l>A puttocke set on pearche, fast by a falcons side, </l>
          <l>Will quickly shew it selfe a kight, as time hath often tride. </l>
          <l>And in my musing minde, I feare to finde like fall, </l>
          <l>As iust reward to recompence my rash attempts withall. </l>
          <l>Thou bidst, and I must bowe, thou wilt that I shall write, </l>
          <l>Thou canst command my wery muse some verses to endite. </l>
          <l>And yet perdie, thy booke is fraughte with learned verse, </l>
          <l>Such skill as in my musing minde I can none like reherse. </l>
          <l>What followes then for me? but if I must néedes write, </l>
          <l>To set downe by the falcons side, my selfe a sillie kight. </l>
          <l>And yet the sillie kight, well weyed in each degrée, </l>
          <l>May serue sometimes (as in his kinde) for mans commoditie. </l>
          <l>The kight can wéede the worme, from corne and costly ●éedes, </l>
          <l>The kight cā kill the ●●owl●iwarpe, in pleasant meads that bréeds: </l>
          <l>Out of the stately stréetes, the kight can clense the filth, </l>
          <l>As mē can clēse the worthlesse wéedes, frō fruteful fallowed tilth. </l>
          <l>And onely set aside the hennes poore progenie, </l>
          <l>I cannot see who can accuse the kight for fellonie. </l>
          <l>The falcon, she must féede on partritch, and on quaile, </l>
          <l>A pigeon, plouer, ducke and drake, hearne, lapwing, teale, &amp; ●aile, </l>
          <l>Hir hungrie throte deuours both foode and deintie fare, </l>
          <l>Whereby I take occasion, thus boldly to compare. </l>
          <l>And as a sillie kight, (not falcon like that flie, </l>
          <l>Nor yet presume to houer by mount Hellycon on hye) </l>
          <l>I frendly yet presume, vppon my frends request, </l>
          <l>In barreine verse to shew my skill, then take it for the best. </l>
          <l>And <hi>Douty Douglas●e </hi>thou, that arte of faulcons kinde, </l>
          <l>Giue willing eare yet to the kight, and beare his words in mind. </l>
          <l>Serue thou first God thy Lord, and praise him euermore, </l>

          <l>Thy Parents follow next, for honor and for awe, </l>
          <l>Thy frends vse alwayes faithfully, for so commands the lawe. </l>
          <l>Thy séemely selfe at last, thou shalte likewise regard, </l>
          <pb n="375" xml:id="ep000826-170-b"/>
          <l>And of thy selfe this lesson learne, and take it as reward: </l>
          <l>That loke how farre desertes, may seme in thée to shine, </l>
          <l>So farre thou maist set out thy selfe, without empeach or crime. </l>
          <l>For this I dare a●●w, without selfe loue (alight) </l>
          <l>It can scarce be that vertue dwell, in any earthly wight. </l>
          <l>But if in such selfe loue, thou séeme to wade so farre, </l>
          <l>As fall to fowle presumption, and iudge thy selfe a starre, </l>
          <l>Beware betimes and thinke, in our Etymologie, </l>
          <l>Such faults are plainly called pride, and in french Surquydrye. </l>
          <l>Lo thus can I pore kight, aduenture for to teach, </l>
          <l>The falcon flie, and yet forewarne, she row not past hir reach. </l>
          <l>Thus can I wéede the worme, which séeketh to deuoure </l>
          <l>The séeds of vertue, which might grow within thee euery houre. </l>
          <l>Thus can I kill the mowle, which else would ouerthrow </l>
          <l>The good foundacion of thy fame, with euery litle blowe. </l>
          <l>And thus can I conuey, out of thy comely brest, </l>
          <l>The sluttish heapes of p●euish pride, which might defile the rest. </l>
          <l>Perchance some falcons flie, which will not greatly grutch, </l>
          <l>To learne thée first to loue thy selfe, and then to loue to mutch. </l>
          <l>But I am none of those, I list not so to range, </l>
          <l>I haue mās meate enough at home, what néed I thē séeke change. </l>
          <l>I am no peacocke I: my fethers be not gay, </l>
          <l>And though they were, I sée my féete suche fonde affectes to stay. </l>
          <l>I list not set to sale a thing so litle, worth, </l>
          <l>I rather could kepe close my crease, than séeke to set it forth. </l>
          <l>Wherefore if in this verse, which thou commands to flowe, </l>
          <l>Thou chaunce to fall on construing, whereby some doubtes may grow, </l>
          <l>Yet grant this only boone, peruse it twise or thrise, </l>
          <l>Disgest it well eare thou condemne the depth of my deuise. </l>
          <l>And vse it like the nut, first cracke the outward shell, </l>
          <l>Then trie the kirnell by the tast, and it may please thée well. </l>
          <l>Do not as barbers do, which wash beards curiously, </l>
          <l>Then cut them off, then cast them out, in open stréetes to lie. </l>
          <l>Remember therewithall, my money is tied in chaines, </l>

          <l>It was thine owne request, remember so it was, </l>

          <head>Gascoignes Epitaph vppon capitaine Bourcher late slayne in the vvarres in Zel●●d●, the vvhiche hath bene termed the tale of a stone as follovveth. </head>
          <lg>
            <l>FYe Captaines fie, your tongs are tied to close, </l>
            <l>Your souldiers eke by silence purchase shame: </l>
            <l>Can no man penne in metre nor in prose, </l>
            <l>The life, the death, the valiante acts, the fame, </l>
            <l>The birth, behauioure, nor the noble name, </l>
            <l>Of such a féere as you in sight haue lost? </l>
            <l>Alas such paines would quickly quite the cost. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Bourcher is dead, whome each of you did knowe, </l>
            <l>Yet no man writes one word to painte his praise, </l>
            <l>His sprite on high, his carkasse here belowe, </l>
            <l>Do both condemne your doting idle dayes: </l>
            <l>Yet ceasse they not to sound his worthy wayes, </l>
            <l>Who liued to die, and died againe to liue, </l>
            <l>With death deere bought, he did his death forgiue. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>He might for birth haue boasted noble race, </l>
            <l>Yet were his manners meeke and alwayes m●lde, </l>
            <l>Who gaue a gesse by gazing on his face, </l>
            <l>And iudgde thereby, might quickly be beguilde: </l>
            <l>In fiel●e a lion and in towne a childe, </l>
            <l>Fierce to his foe, but courteouse to his friende. </l>
            <l>Alas the while, his life so soone should end? </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>To serue his Prince his life was euer prest, </l>
            <l>To serue his God, his death he thought but dew, </l>
            <l>In all attempts as frowarde as the best, </l>
            <l>And all to forwards whiche we all may rew, </l>
            <l>His life so shewed, his death eke tried it true: </l>
            <l>For where Gods foes in thickest prease did stande, </l>
            <l>Bourcher caught bane with bloudy sword in hande. </l>

            <l>And marke the courage of a noble harte, </l>
            <l>When he in bedde lay wounded wondrous sore, </l>
            <l>And heard allarme, he soone forgat his smarte, </l>
            <l>And callde for armes to shewe his seruice more: </l>
            <l>I will to fielde● quoth he) and God before. </l>
            <l>Which sayde, he sailde into more quiet coast, </l>
            <l>Still praysing God, and so gaue vp the ghost. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Now muze not reader though we stones can speake, </l>
            <l>Or write sometimes the déedes of worthy ones, </l>
            <l>I could not hold although my harte should breake, </l>
            <l>Bycause here by me buried are his bones, </l>
            <l>But I must tell this tale thus for the nones. </l>
            <l>When men crie mumme and keepe such silence long, </l>

          <head>Gascoignes deuise of a maske for the right honorable Viscount Mountacute, written (as I haue heard Master Gascoigne himselfe declare) vpon this occasion, when the sayde L. had prepa●ed to solemnise two mariages betwene his sonne and heire and the daughter of sir William Do●mer knighte, and betwene the sonne and heire of sir William Dormer, and the daughter of the saide L. Mountacute: there were eighte gentlemen (all of bloud or a●●iance to the saide L. Mountacute) which had determined to present a maske at the day appoynted for the sayd mariages, and so farre they had proceeded therin, that they had alredy bought furniture of silks. &amp;c. and had caused their garments to be cut of the Venetian fashion. Newe then they began to imagin● that (without some speciall demonstraciō) it would seeme somewhat obscure to haue Venetians presented rather than other countrey men. Wherevpon ●hey entreated Master Gascoigne to deui●e some verses to be vttered by an Actor wherein mighte be some discourse conuenient to render a good cause of the Ve●etians presence. Master Gascoigne calling to minde that there is a noble house of the Mountac●tes in Italie, and therewithall that the L. Mountacute here doth quarter the cote of an anciēt english gentlemā called Mounth●rme, and ●ath the inheritance of the sayde house, did therevppon deuise to bring in ● Boy of the age of twelue or xiiij. yeres, who shoulde fayne that he was a Mounthermer by the fathers side, and a Mou●tacute by the mothers side, and that his father being slayne at the last warres against the Tu●ke, and he there taken, he was recoue●ed by the Venetians to their last victorie, and with them sayling towardes Venice, they were driuen by tempest vppon these coasts, and so came to the mariage vppon report as followeth, and the said Boy pronounced the deuise in this ●orte. </head>

          <l>WHat wonder you my Lords? why gaze you gentlemen? </l>
          <l>And wherefore maruaile you <hi>mez Dames</hi>, I pray you tell me then? </l>
          <l>Is it so rare a sight, or yet so strange a toy, </l>
          <l>Amongst so many noble péeres, to sée one <hi>Pouer Boy</hi>? </l>
          <l>Why? boyes haue bene allowed in euery kind of age, </l>
          <l>As Gany●ede that prety boy, in Heauen is Ioue his page. </l>
          <l>Cupid that mightie God although his force be fearse, </l>
          <l>Yet is he but a naked boy, as Poets do rehearse. </l>
          <l>And many a prety boy a mighty man hath proued, </l>
          <l>And serued his Prince at all assayes deseruing to be loued. </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Percase my strange attire </hi>my glittering golden gite, </l>
          <l>Doth either make you maruell thus, or moue you with delite. </l>
          <l>Yet wonder not my Lords for if your honors please, </l>
          <l>But euen to giue me eare awhile, I will your doubts apease. </l>
          <l>And you shall know the cause, wherefore these robes are worne, </l>
          <l>And why I go outlandish like, yet being english borne. </l>
          <l>And why I thus presume, to presse into this place, </l>
          <l>And why I (simple boy) am bold to looke such men in face. </l>
          <l>First then you must per stande, I am no stranger I, </l>
          <l>But english boy, in England borne, and bred but euen hereby. </l>
          <l>My father was a knight <hi>Mount Hermer </hi>was his name, </l>
          <l>My mother of the Mountacutes, a house of worthy fame. </l>
          <l>My father from his youth was trained vp in field, </l>
          <l>And always toke his chiefe delight, in helmet speare and shielde. </l>
          <l>Soldado for his life, and in his happie dayes </l>
          <l>Soldado like hath lost his life, to his immortall prayse. </l>
          <l>The thundering fame which blew about the world so wide, </l>
          <l>How that the christian enmie, the Turke that prince of pride, </l>
          <l>Addressed had his power, to swarme vppon the seas, </l>
          <l>With gallies, foists, and such like ships, wel armde at all assays, </l>
          <pb n="384" xml:id="ep000826-175-a"/>
          <l>And that he made his vaunt, the gredy fishe to glut, </l>
          <l>With g●bs of christians carkasses, in cruell péeces cut. </l>
          <l>These newes of this report, did pierce my fathers eares, </l>
          <l>But neuer touched his noble harte, with any sparke of feares. </l>
          <l>For well he knew the trade of all the ●urkishe warres, </l>
          <l>And had amongst them shed his bloud at many cruell iarres. </l>
          <l>In Rhodes his race begon, a slender tall yong man, </l>
          <l>Where he by many martial feats, his spurres of knighthod wan. </l>
          <l>Yea though the péece was lost, yet won he honoure still, </l>
          <l>And euermore against the ●urkes he warred by his will. </l>
          <l>At Chios many know, how hardily he fought, </l>
          <l>And howe with streames of striuing bloud, his honoure deare hée bought. </l>
          <l>At length enforst to yeld with many captaines mo, </l>
          <l>He bought his libertie with lands and let his goodes ago. </l>
          <l>Zechynes of glistering golde, two thousand was his price, </l>
          <l>The which to pay his lands must leape, for else he were vnwise. </l>
          <l>Beléeue me now my lords although the losse be mine, </l>
          <l>Yet I confesse them better solde, than like a slaue to pine. </l>
          <l>"For lands may come againe, but libertie once lost, </l>
          <l>" Can neuer finde such recompence, as counteruailes the cost. </l>
          <l>My selfe now know the case, who like my fathers lot, </l>
          <l>Was like of late for to haue lost my libertie god wot. </l>
          <l>My father (as I say) enforste to leaue his lande </l>
          <l>In mortgage to my mothers kinne, for ready coine in hande, </l>
          <l>Gan now vppon these new●s, which earst I did rehearse, </l>
          <l>Prepare himselfe to saue his pawne or else to léese his pheares. </l>
          <l>And first his raunsome paide, with that which did remaine, </l>
          <l>He rigged vp a proper Barke, was called <hi>Leffort Brittayne</hi>. </l>
          <l>And like a venturer (besides him séemely selfe) </l>
          <l>Determined for to venture me and all his worldly pelfe. </l>
          <l>Perhaps some hope of gaine perswaded so his minde, </l>
          <l>For sure his hauty harte was bent, some great exployte to finde. </l>
          <l>How so it were, the winds now hoysted vp our sayles, </l>
          <l>We furrowing in the foming floudes, to take our best auailes. </l>
          <l>Now hearken to my words, and marke you well the same, </l>
          <pb n="385" xml:id="ep000826-175-b"/>
          <l>For now I will declare the cause wherefore I hither came. </l>
          <l>My father (as I say) had set vp all his rest, </l>
          <l>And tost on seas both day and night, disdayning idlenesse, </l>
          <l>We lefte our forelands end, we past the coast of France, </l>
          <l>We reacht the cape of Finestre our course for to aduance. </l>
          <l>We past Marrocchus streights, and at the last descried, </l>
          <l>The fertile coasts of Cyprus soile, which I my selfe first spied. </l>
          <l>My selfe (a forewarde boy) on highest top was plast, </l>
          <l>And there I sawe the Ciprian shoare, whereto we sailde in hast. </l>
          <l>Which when I had declared vnto the masters mate, </l>
          <l>He lepte for ioy and thanked God, of that our happie state. </l>
          <l>"But what remaines to man, that can continue long? </l>
          <l>" What sunne can shine so cleare and bright but clouds may rise amōg? </l>
          <l>Which sentence soone was proued, by our vnhappie hap, </l>
          <l>We thought our selues full nere our frendes, &amp; light in ●nimies lap. </l>
          <l>The Turke the tirāt he, with siege had girte the walles, </l>
          <l>Of famouse Famagosta then and sought to make them thrals. </l>
          <l>And as he lay by lande, in strong and stately trenche, </l>
          <l>So was his power prest by sea, his christian foes to drenche. </l>
          <l>Uppon the waltring waues, his foistes and gallies fléete, </l>
          <l>More forrest like than orderly, for such a man most méete. </l>
          <l>This heauie sight once seene, we turnd our course a pace, </l>
          <l>And set vp all our sailes in haste, to giue such furie place. </l>
          <l>But out alas, our wills, and winds were contrarie, </l>
          <l>For raging blasts did blowe vs still vppon our enimie. </l>
          <l>My father séeing then, whereto he néedes must go, </l>
          <l>And that the mightie hand of God, had it apointed so, </l>
          <l>Most like a worthy knight (though certeine of his death) </l>
          <l>Gan cleane forget al wailing words as lauish of his breath. </l>
          <l>And to his christian crew, this (too shorte) tale he told, </l>
          <l>To comfort them which séemd to faint, &amp; make the coward bolde, </l>
          <l>"Fellowes in armes, quoth he, although I beare the charge, </l>
          <l>" And take vpon me chieftaines name, of this vnhappie barge, </l>
          <l>"Yet are you all my pheares, and as one companie, </l>
          <l>" We must like true companions, togither liue and die, </l>
          <pb n="386" xml:id="ep000826-176-a"/>
          <l>"You sée quoth he our foes, with furious force at hand, </l>
          <l>" And in whose hands our handfull heare vnable is to stand. </l>
          <l>"What resteth then to do, should we vnto them yeld? </l>
          <l>" And wilfully receiue that yoke, which christians cannot weld. </l>
          <l>"No sure, hereof be ●ure, our liues were so vnsure, </l>
          <l>" And though we liue, yet so to liue, as better death endure. </l>
          <l>"To heare those hellish fends in raging blasphemie, </l>
          <l>" Defye our only sauioure, were this no miserie? </l>
          <l>"To see the fowle abuse of boyes in tender yeares, </l>
          <l>" The which I knowe must néedes abhor all honest christians eares. </l>
          <l>"To sée maides rauished, wiues, wom●n f●rst by f●are, </l>
          <l>" And much more mischiefe thā this time can let me vtter here. </l>
          <l>"Alas, quoth he, I tell not all, my tong is tide, </l>
          <l>" But all the slaueries on the earth we should with them abide, </l>
          <l>"How much were better than to die in worthy wise, </l>
          <l>" And so to make our carcasses, a willing sacrifice? </l>
          <l>"So shall we pay the debt, which vnto God is due, </l>
          <l>" So shall you die in his defence, who deind to die for you. </l>
          <l>"And who with hardy hand most turkish tikes can quell, </l>
          <l>" Let him accompt in conscience, to please his maker well. </l>
          <l>"You sée quoth he, my sonne, wherewith he lookte on me, </l>
          <l>" Whom but a babe, yet haue I brought, my partner here to be, </l>
          <l>"For, him I must confesse, my harte is pensiue now, </l>
          <l>" To leaue him liuing thus in youth, to die I know not how. </l>
          <l>"But since it pleaseth God, I may not murmure I, </l>
          <l>" If God had pleased we both should liue, and as god wil we die. </l>
          <l>Thus with a braying sigh, his noble tong he staide, </l>
          <l>Commaunding all the ordinance, in order to be laide, </l>
          <l>And placing all his men in order for to fight, </l>
          <l>Fell groueling first vppon his face, before them all in sight. </l>
          <l>And when in secret so he whispered had a while, </l>
          <l>He raisde his hed with cherefull looke, his sorrowes to beguile: </l>
          <l>And with the rest he prayde, to God in heauen on hie, </l>
          <l>Whi●h ended thus, <hi>Thou only Lord, canst helpe in miserie. </hi>
          </l>
          <l>This said, behold, the Turkes enclosde vs round about, </l>
          <pb n="387" xml:id="ep000826-176-b"/>
          <l>And séemd to wonder that we durst resist so great a ro●●. </l>
          <l>Wherat they doubt not long, for though our power was slender, </l>
          <l>We sent them signes by Canon shot, that we ment not to rēder. </l>
          <l>Then might we see them chafe, them might we heare them rage, </l>
          <l>And all at once they bent their force, about our sillie cage. </l>
          <l>Our ordinance bestowed, our men them selues defend, </l>
          <l>On euerie side so thicke beset, they might not long contend. </l>
          <l>But as their captaine wild, each man his force did strayne, </l>
          <l>To send a Turke (some two or thrée) vnto the hellishe trayne. </l>
          <l>And he him selfe which sawe, he might no more abide, </l>
          <l>Did thrust amid the thickest throng, and so with honoure died. </l>
          <l>With him there died likewise, his best approued men. </l>
          <l>The rest did yeld as men amazd, they had no courage then. </l>
          <l>Amongst the which my selfe, was tane by Turks alas, </l>
          <l>And with the Turks a turkish life, in Turkie must passe. </l>
          <l>I was not done to death for so I often craude, </l>
          <l>But like a slaue before the Gates, of Famagosta saude. </l>
          <l>That péece once put to sacke, I thither was conueyed. </l>
          <l>And vnder safegard euermore, I sillie boye was stayed. </l>
          <l>There did I sée such sights as yet my hart do pricke, </l>
          <l>I sawe the noble Bragadine, when he was fleyd quick. </l>
          <l>First like a slaue enforst to beare to euery breach, </l>
          <l>Two baskets laden full with earth Mustaffa did him teach. </l>
          <l>By whome he might not passe before he kisse the ground, </l>
          <l>These cruell torments (yet with mo) that worthy souldier foūd. </l>
          <l>His eares cut from his head, they set him in a chaire, </l>
          <l>And from a maine yard hoisted him alofte into the aire, </l>
          <l>That so he might be shewed with crueltie and spight, </l>
          <l>Unto vs all, whose weping eies did much abhore the sight. </l>
          <l>Alas why do I thus with wofull words rehearce, </l>
          <l>These werie newes which all our harts with pitttie néedes muste pearce? </l>
          <l>Well then to tell you foorth, I still a slaue remaind, </l>
          <l>To one, which Prelybassa hight, who held me stil enchai●d. </l>
          <l>With him I went to Seas into the gulfe of Pant, </l>

          <pb n="388" xml:id="ep000826-177-a"/>

          <l>And as they waltered thus with tides and billowes tost, </l>
          <l>Their hope had hap, for at the last they met them to their cost. </l>
          <l>As in O●tober last vppon the seuenth day, </l>
          <l>They found the force of christian knights addrest in good aray. </l>
          <l>And shall I trie my tong to tell the whole discourse, </l>
          <l>And how they did encounter first and how they ioynd in force? </l>
          <l>Then harken now my lords, for sure my memorie, </l>
          <l>Doth yet record the very plot of all this victorie. </l>
          <l>The christian crew came on, in forme of battaile pight, </l>
          <l>And like a cressent cast them selues preparing for to fight. </l>
          <l>On other side the Turkes, which trusted power to much, </l>
          <l>Disorderly did spread their force, the will of God was such. </l>
          <l>Well, at the last they met, and first with cannons thunder, </l>
          <l>Each other sought with furious force to slit their ships in sunder. </l>
          <l>The Barkes are battered sore, the galli●s gald with shot, </l>
          <l>The hulks are hit and euery man must stand vnto his lot. </l>
          <l>The powder sendes his smoke into the cruddy skies, </l>
          <l>The smoulder stops our nose with stench, the sunne offends our eies, </l>
          <l>The pots of lime vnsleakt, from highest top are cast, </l>
          <l>The parched peas are not forgot to make them slip as fast. </l>
          <l>The wilde fire works are wrought and cast in foemens face, </l>
          <l>The grappling hooks are stretched foorth, the pikes are pusht apace. </l>
          <l>The halberts hew on hed, the browne bills bruze the bones, </l>
          <l>The harquebush doth spit his spight, with prety percing stones. </l>
          <l>The drummes crie dub a dub, the braying trumpets blow, </l>
          <l>The whistling fi●es are seldome herd, these sounds do drowne thē so. </l>
          <l>The voice of warlike wights, to comforte them that faint, </l>
          <l>The piteous plaints of goldē harts, which wer with feares attaint. </l>
          <l>The groning of such ghosts as gasped now for breath, </l>
          <l>The praiers of the better sort, prepared vnto death, </l>
          <l>And to be short, each griefe which on the earth may growe, </l>
          <l>Was and easie to be found, vppon these flouds to flowe. </l>

          <l>If any sight on earth, may vnto hell resemble, </l>
          <l>Then sure this was a hellishe sight, it makes me yet to tremble: </l>
          <l>And in this blouddie fyght, when halfe the day was spent, </l>
          <l>It pleazed God to helpe his flocke, which thus in poūd was pent. </l>
          <l>The generall for Spayne, gan galde that Ga●ley sore, </l>
          <l>Wherin my <hi>Prely Ba●●a </hi>was, and grieude it more and more: </l>
          <l>Upon that other side, with force of swoorde and flame, </l>
          <l>The good 〈◊〉 generall dyd charge vpon the same. </l>
          <l>At length they came aboorde, and in his raging pride, </l>
          <l>St●oke of this Turkish captains hed, which blasphemd as it dide: </l>
          <l>Oh howe I féele the bloud now tickle in my brest, </l>
          <l>To think what ioy then pierst my heart, and how I thought me blest </l>
          <l>To sée that cruell Turke whiche helde me as his slaue </l>
          <l>By happie hande of Christians his payment thus to haue: </l>
          <l>His head from shoulders cut, vpon a pyke did stande, </l>
          <l>The whiche <hi>Don Iohn </hi>of Austrye helde in his triumphant hand. </l>
          <l>The boldest Bassa then, that did in lyfe remayne, </l>
          <l>Gan tremble at the sight hereof for priuy griefe and payne. </l>
          <l>Thus when these fierce had fo●ght from morning vntill night, </l>
          <l>Christe gaue his stocke the victorie, and put his foes to flight: </l>
          <l>And of the Turkish trayne were eight score Galeys tane, </l>
          <l>Fiftéene soonk, fiue and twentie burnt, &amp; brought vnto their bane, </l>
          <l>Of Christians set at large were fourtéene thousand soules, </l>
          <l>Turks twentie thousande registred in Beelzebub his rolles. </l>
          <l>Thus haue you nowe my Lords, the summe of all their fight, </l>

          <l>For proofe he beares ●he note of follie nowe, </l>
          <l>Who shotte sometimes to hit Philosophie, </l>
          <l>And aske you why? for sooth I make auow, </l>
          <l>Bycause his wanton wittes went all awrie. </l>
          <l>Next that, he shot to be a man of lawe, </l>
          <l>And spent some time with lea●ned Litleton, </l>
          <l>Yet in the end, he proued but a dawe, </l>
          <l>For lawe was darke and he had quickly done. </l>
          <l>Then could he wish Fitzharbert such a braine, </l>
          <l>As Tully had, to write the law by arte, </l>
          <l>So that with pleasure, or with litle paine, </l>
          <l>He might perhaps, haue caught a trewants parte. </l>
          <l>But all to late, he most mislikte the thing, </l>
          <l>Which most might helpe to guide his arrow streight, </l>
          <l>He winked wrong, and so let slippe the string, </l>
          <l>Which cast him wide, for all his queint conceit. </l>
          <l>From thence ●e shotte to catch a courtly grace, </l>
          <l>And thought euen there to wield the world at will, </l>
          <l>But out alas he much mistooke the place, </l>
          <l>And shot awrie at euery rouer still. </l>
          <l>The blasing baits which drawe the gazing eye, </l>
          <l>Unfethered there his first affect●on, </l>
          <l>No wonder then although he shot awrie, </l>
          <l>Wanting the fethers of discretion. </l>
          <l>Yet more than them, the marks of dignitie, </l>
          <l>He much mistooke and shot the wronger way, </l>
          <l>Thinking the purse of prodigalitie, </l>
          <l>Had bene best meane to purchase such a pray, </l>
          <l>He thought the flattring face which fleareth still, </l>
          <l>Had bene full fraught with all fi●elitie, </l>
          <l>And that such words as courti●rs vse at will. </l>

          <l>Could not haue varied from the veritie. </l>
          <l>But when his bonet butte●ed with gold, </l>
          <l>His comelie cape begarded all with gay, </l>
          <l>His bumbast hose, with linings manifold, </l>
          <l>His knit silke stocks and all his queint aray, </l>
          <l>Had pickt his pu●se of all the Peter pence, </l>
          <l>Which might haue paide for his promotion, </l>
          <l>Then (all to late) he found that light expence, </l>
          <l>Had q●ite quencht out the courts deuotion. </l>
          <l>So that since then the tast of miserie, </l>
          <l>Hath bene alwayes full bitter in his bit, </l>
          <l>And why? forsooth bicause he shot awrie, </l>
          <l>Mistaking still the markes which others hit. </l>
          <l>But now behold what marke the man doth find, </l>
          <l>He shootes to be a souldier in his age, </l>
          <l>Mistrusting all the vertues of the minde, </l>
          <l>He trusts the power of his personage. </l>
          <l>As though long limmes led by a lusty hart, </l>
          <l>M●ght yet suffice to make him rich againe, </l>
          <l>But flussing fraies haue taught him such a parte, </l>

          <l>Whereby he may a richer man be made. </l>
          <l>He cannot climbe as other catchers can, </l>
          <l>To leade a charge before himselfe be led, </l>
          <l>He cannot spoile the simple sakeles man, </l>

            <l>Resigne to me your happie dayes, and boast no more of ioy: </l>
            <l>Sir Paris first stand forth, make aunswere for thy pheare, </l>

            <l>Tell truth at last, and so be sure to saue thy selfe from shame. </l>
            <l>Then gentle Shepheard sat: what madnesse did thée moue </l>
            <l>To choose of all the flowres in Greece, foule Helene for thy loue? </l>

            <l>He sliude the gentle Slippe, which could both twist and twind, </l>

            <l>Where I may weare my willing mind with mone, </l>
            <l>And where the sighes which boyle out of my brest, </l>
            <l>May skald my heart, and yet the cause vnknowne. </l>
            <l>All this I do, for thée my swéetest sowre, </l>
            <l>For whome (of yore) I counted not of care, </l>
            <l>For whome with hungrie iawes I did deuoure </l>
            <l>The secret baite which lurked in the snare: </l>
            <l>For whome I thought all foreine pleasures payne, </l>
            <l>For whome againe, all paine did pleasure séeme, </l>
            <l>But only thine, I found all fansies vayne, </l>
            <l>But onely thine, I did no dolours déeme. </l>
            <l>Such was the rage, that whylome did possesse </l>
            <l>The priuie corners of my mazed mind: </l>
            <l>When hote desire, did coumpt those torments lesse </l>
            <l>Which gaind the gaze that did my fredome bind. </l>
            <l>And now (with care) I can record those dayes, </l>
            <l>And call to mind the quiet life I led </l>
            <l>Before I first beheld thy golden rayes, </l>
            <l>When thine vntruth yet troubled not my hed. </l>
            <l>Remember thou, as I cannot forget, </l>
            <l>How I had layd, both loue, and lust aside, </l>
            <l>And how I had my fixed fancie set, </l>
            <l>In constant vow, for euer to abide. </l>
            <l>The bitter proofe of pangs in pleasure past, </l>

            <l>The painted heauen, which turnde to hell at last </l>
            <l>The fréedome faind, which brought me but to thrall. </l>
            <l>The lingring sute, well fed with fresh delayes. </l>
            <pb n="421" xml:id="ep000826-193-b"/>
            <l>The wasted vowes which fled with euery winde: </l>
            <l>The restlesse nights, to purchase pleasing dayes, </l>
            <l>The toyling dayes to please my restlesse minde. </l>
            <l>All these (with mo) had brused so my brest, </l>
            <l>And graft such griefe within my gronyng heart, </l>
            <l>That I had left dame fansie and the rest </l>
            <l>To gréener yeares, which might endure the smart. </l>
            <l>My wearie bones did beare away the skarres, </l>
            <l>Of many a wounde, receyued by disdayne: </l>
            <l>So that I founde the fruite of all those warres, </l>
            <l>To be naught else but pangs of vnknowne payne. </l>
            <l>And now myne eyes were shut from such delight, </l>
            <l>My fansie faynt, my hote desires were colde, </l>
            <l>When cruell hap, presented to my sight, </l>
            <l>Thy maydens face, in yeares which were not olde. </l>
            <l>I thinke the goddesse of reuenge deuysde, </l>

            <l>Bycause I had in youthfull yeares dispysde, </l>

            <l>Yea so I did, the iudge can say no lesse, </l>

            <l>And all in rage, enraged as I am, </l>
            <l>I take my shéete, my slyppers and my gowne, </l>
            <l>And in the Bathe from whence but late I came, </l>
            <l>I cast my selfe in dolors there to drowne. </l>
            <l>There all alone I can my selfe conueye, </l>
            <l>Into some corner where I sit vnseene, </l>

            <l>I sée a trustie token for the nones. </l>
            <l>I spy a bracelet bounde aboute mine arme, </l>

            <l>For as this lace, by leysure learnes to weare, </l>
            <l>So must I fainte, euen as the candle wasteth, </l>
            <l>These thoughts (déere swéete) within my brest I beare, </l>

            <l>Here with I feele the droppes of sweltring sweate, </l>
            <l>Which trickle downe my face, enforced so, </l>
            <l>And in my body féele I like wyse beate, </l>
            <l>A burning harte, which tosseth to and fro. </l>
            <l>Thus all in flames I sinderlyke consume, </l>

            <l>Soone might I fret my facyes all in fume, </l>
            <l>And like a G●ost my ghost his graue might finde. </l>
            <l>But frysing hope doth blowe full in my face, </l>
            <l>And colde of c●res becōmes my cordiall, </l>

            <l>And when from thence our company me driues, </l>
            <l>Or weary woes do make me chaunge my seate, </l>

            <l>And when I rise, my corpse for to araye, </l>
            <l>I take the glasse, sometimes (but not for pride, </l>
            <l>For God he knowes my minde is not so gaye) </l>

            <l>The noble face was faire and freshe of hewe, </l>
            <l>My wrinckled face is fo●le and fadeth fast: </l>
            <l>The noble face was vnto thée but newe, </l>

            <l>And still accuse my selfe of Surcuydry: </l>
            <l>As one that am vnworthy to enioye, </l>
            <l>The lasting fruite of such a loue as thine, </l>
            <l>Thus am I tyckled still with euery toye, </l>
            <l>And when my Fellowes call me downe to dyne, </l>
            <l>No chaunge of meate prouokes mine appetite, </l>
            <l>Nor sauce can serue to taste my meates withall, </l>

            <l>For Ginger, Graines, and for eche other spyce, </l>
            <l>Where with I mixe the noble wine apace, </l>
            <l>My fellowes prayse the depth of my deuise, </l>
            <l>And say it is as good as Ippocrace. </l>
            <l>As Ippocrace say I? and then I swelt, </l>
            <l>My faynting lymmes streight fall into a sowne, </l>
            <l>Before the taste of Ippocrace is felt, </l>
            <l>The naked name in dolours doth me drowne, </l>
            <l>For then I call vnto my troubled mynd, </l>
            <l>That Ippocrace hath bene thy dayly drincke, </l>
            <l>That Ippocrace hath walkt with euery winde </l>
            <l>In bottells that were fylled to the brincke. </l>
            <l>With Ippocrace thou banquetedst full ofte, </l>
            <l>With Ippocrace thou madst thy selfe full merry, </l>
            <l>Such chéere had set thy new loue so alofte, </l>
            <l>That olde loue now was scarsely worth a cherry. </l>
            <l>And then againe I fall into a traunce, </l>
            <l>But when my breth returnes against my will, </l>
            <l>Before my tongue can tell my wofull chaunce, </l>
            <l>I heare my fellowes how they whisper still. </l>
            <l>One sayth that Ippocrace is contrary, </l>
            <l>Unto my nature and comple●ion, </l>
            <l>Whereby they iudge that all my maladye, </l>

            <pb n="429" xml:id="ep000826-197-b"/>
            <l>An other sayth, no, no this man is weake, </l>
            <l>And for such weake, so hote things are not best, </l>
            <l>Then at the last I heare no liar speake, </l>
            <l>But one which knowes the cause of myne vnrest, </l>
            <l>And saith, this man is (for my life) in loue, </l>
            <l>He hath receiued repulse, or dronke disdaine, </l>
            <l>Alas crie I: and ere I can remoue, </l>
            <l>Into a sowne I soo●e returne againe. </l>
            <l>Thus driue I foorth, my dolefull dining time, </l>
            <l>And trouble others with my troubles still, </l>
            <l>But when I here, the bell hath passed prime </l>
            <l>Into the Bathe I wallow by my will, </l>
            <l>That there my teares (vnséene) might ease my griefe, </l>
            <l>For though I sterue yet haue I fed my fill, </l>
            <l>In priuie pangs I count my best reliefe. </l>
            <l>And still I striue in wery woes to drench. </l>
            <l>But when I plondge, then wo is at an ebbe, </l>
            <l>My glowing coles are all to quicke to quench, </l>
            <l>And I (to warme) am wrapped in the webbe, </l>
            <l>Which makes me swim against the wished waue, </l>
            <l>Lo thus (déere wench) I leade a lothsome life, </l>
            <l>And gréedely I séeke the gréedy graue, </l>
            <l>To make an end of all these stormes and strife. </l>
            <l>But death is deafe, and heares not my desire, </l>
            <l>So that my dayes continue still in dole, </l>
            <l>And in my nights, I féele the secret fire, </l>
            <l>Which close in embers, coucheth like a cole, </l>
            <l>And in the day hath bin but raked vp, </l>
            <l>With couering ashes of my companie, </l>
            <l>Now breaks it out, and boyles the carefull cuppe, </l>
            <l>Which in my hart, doth hang full heauily. </l>
            <l>I melt in teares, I swelt in chilling sweat, </l>
            <l>My swelling heart, breaks with delay of payne </l>
            <l>I fréeze in hope, yet burne in hast of heate, </l>
