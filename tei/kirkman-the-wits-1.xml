        <head>To the READERS </head>
        <opener>The Stationer <hi>sends Greeting</hi>: </opener>
        <p>WHereas I have undertaken to collect a Miscellany of all Humours which our Fam'd Comedies have exquisitely and aptly represented in the becoming dress of the Stage: Now know ye that I think fit in compliance with the Design to usher in this Body of Humours with a Preface, for no other reason, nor to other purpose, then to humour and imitate the Mode of Writers; letting you see the folly and impertinence of Epistolary Personations (never acted before) which shew their Books are chiefly written for their own sakes, and to adorn our Stalls. </p>
        <p>Now I must tell you, my Plot with my Humours is clearly for sale; for I intend to raise no other reputation to my self then that of Ready Money; and that I onely be-speak in these preparatory lines: since it were besides the purpose, and an unpardonable presumption, to commend these excellent Fancies, which do command, and have Emerited universal applause. </p>
        <p>All I am obliged to say therefore, is in justification <pb xml:id="ep000786-003-a"/>of the Collection of them into this entire consistencie, the making of a fluid a solid Body, which even the Experiment it self, among the Ingenious, will fairly defend. But I should think the easie accommodation of them to every Gusto of Delight in this ready variety (saving the difficulty of purveying and hacking up and down) should best invite and entertain you. </p>
        <p>He that knows a Play, knows that Humours have no such fixedness and indissoluble connexion to the Design, but that without injury or <hi>forcible revulsion </hi>they may be removed to an advantage; which is so demonstrable, that I am sure nothing but a <hi>morose propriety </hi>will offer to deny it. </p>
        <p>To be a little serious: I was told by people that know better then my self, they would be in this Model more beneficial in sundry respects, then as they lay dispersed before. There is no sort of Melancholy whose sullen dulness and severe aversion to company, may not at one look be mockt out by one or other of these merry attemperatures and resemblances, which will most efficaciously manifest its Folly as in a Glass. Next, he who would make up a Treatment to his Friends by any such diversion, cannot study a more compendious method, without the help of Fidlers and mercenary Mimicks, and the long labor of a Cue: one Scene, which may almost be acted Extempore, will be abundantly satisfactory, being chosen fit and suitable to the Company, as none can come amiss. 'Twill make Physick work, 'twill cease <pb xml:id="ep000786-003-b"/>the pains of more inveterate diseases, 'twill allay the heat and distemper of Wine, and generally it is the Panacea, the universal Cure, mighty Mirths Elixir. </p>
        <p>Now you know all the Story, Gentlemen; pray remember the <hi>Rump Drolls</hi>, and for their sakes, </p>

T'other day I saw my face in a pail of water, and I had much ado to forbear drowing of my self. 'Tis no wonder then, that the beauteous Nymph Oenone makes much of me, and lets all the other Shepherds shake their Ears like Asses: and the truth is, if I can finde never a handsomer, she shall serve the turn. This was her birth-day, she being born in the year— one thousand six hundred,— nay hold a little: but on this day of the moneth it was, VVinter or Summer, in the honour of which we all keep holiday: and therefore for the credit of her beauty, and the honour of my own Poetry, I have made such a Copy of Verses on her, as will make her a thousand times handsomer then ever she was in her Life. </p>

Again, he that steals flesh, steals once and gives over; yes, and often pays for it; the other steals every day without satisfaction. To conclude, Bread-stealing is the more Capital Crime: for what he steals, he puts it in at the head; he that steals flesh (as the Dutch Author saies) puts it in at the foot (the lower Member.)
