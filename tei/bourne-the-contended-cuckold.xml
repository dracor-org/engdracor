        <p>THIS Trifle which I am bold to prefix your Name in, like a well drawn Picture, looks alike on each of you, and challenges your Protection and Patronage, you being the sole Promoters and Countenancers of its being what it is; your Commands, together with my want of Consideration, made me undertake a Task which I am conscious to my self I am altogether unfit for. When I had plunged my self into this Sea of Thought, I quickly found my Mistake, and presently became sensible of my Error, though too late to recall it, having given my Promise before for the performance of it. I have taken what care I could to walk by the Rules prescribed me, as you will find by the perusal of it. If there be any thing in it can force a Smile or a kind Look from you, I have reach'd my end, and hope it may take off the edge of your Anger at the rest of an ill writ Play, which wants both Language, Wit and Plot, (which Three if I mistake not,) are the chief Ingredients that make up a Comedy, with which if it be fraught, Nonsense may sometimes pass unregarded. I expect not in this Critical and Censorious Age to fare better than the rest and best of Poets, who for the most part are branded with the Name of Scribling <pb xml:id="ep000457-003-a"/>Fops and Half-wits; and to say Truth, the World hath still been at that pass for some Ages past. Produce me but one Poet, either Ancient or Modern, that ever escaped the Lash of Envious and Malicious Tongues, <q>— Et eris mihi Magnus Apollo; </q>yet I hope that good Nature and sweet Disposition, which you are in a large measure indowed withall, will pass by small Faults and accept the Will for the Deed, from him whose highest Ambition is, that without offence, he may subscribe himself </p>

        <head>THE PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>INdulgent Parents take what care they can </l>
        <l>To breed their Son; but when he once writes Man, </l>
        <l>He thinks himself too great to be advis'd, </l>
        <l>And those which took such care, are then Despis'd: </l>
        <l>He sets up for himself, and learns the way </l>
        <l>To Whore all Night, to Swear and Drink all Day. </l>
        <l>The Spark being thus accomplish'd, think's he's fit </l>
        <l>At a New Play to be a Judge of Wit; </l>
        <l>And takes his Place with as much Confidence, </l>
        <l>As he that's Master of the greatest Sense; </l>
        <l>Sets his Cravat, and then invokes the Powers, </l>
        <l>And Swears all Vizard Masks are Common Whores. </l>
        <l>So Poets tickled with Applause, they are </l>
        <l>Quite alter'd, and no more the Men they were: </l>
        <l>They then grow Proud, and huff their Benefactors, </l>
        <l>And Swear the fault's not in the Play, but Actors. </l>
        <l>The Musick that shall hardly scape his Curse; </l>
        <l>The Scenes and Habits he likes ten times worse; </l>
        <l>And all to make his Bandy Play go down, </l>
        <l>With the more civil Gentry of the Town. </l>
        <l>A Smutty Tale will please the Common sort, </l>
        <l>His greatest care is how to take the Court, </l>
        <l>And get the name of Poet from some Lord, </l>
        <l>None dare gainsay, but gladly take his Word. </l>
        <l>Our Poet's none of these, all his Intent </l>
        <l>Is among Neighbours to make Merriment; </l>
        <l>Which if it take effect, he'th gain'd his ends; </l>
        <l>If not, he hopes the Ladies are his Friends, </l>
        <l>And back'd by them, he cares not who contends. </l>
        <l>Our Poet to your Beauties doth submit, </l>
        <l>And Humbly offers both himself and it. </l>

        <head>The EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>CVSTOM prevails, and you expect we know </l>
        <l>To hear an Epilogue before you go. </l>
        <l>Our Poet finds your Appetites are nice, </l>
        <l>And dares not rule, but gives you this Advice; </l>
        <l>Be govern'd by the Learned in the Laws, </l>
        <l>Who before Judgment always trie the Cause, </l>
        <l>And afterward, if for the first Offence, </l>
        <l>In gentle and kind Terms express their Sense </l>
        <l>In hopes of the Offenders Reformation▪ </l>
        <l>At least they will allow him Transportation, </l>
        <l>Such is the Goodness of our English Nation. </l>
        <l>Then why should you, who here as Judges sit; </l>
        <l>Count all but Dross that is not like your Wit? </l>
        <l>Wit may be Wit, tho not so finely drest, </l>
        <l>As Sense without an Oath may be exprest. </l>
        <l>Pray tell me Gallants, is the Face the worse </l>
        <l>Because the Garment's Country like and Course? </l>
        <l>You are for Beauties, as you are for Wits, </l>
        <l>Nothing but what's Extream your Fancy fits. </l>
        <l>He that writ best never could please you long, </l>
        <l>Sometimes your Humour▪ lies towards a Song; </l>
        <l>But that must be well worded, and refin'd, </l>
        <l>Thus various are the Motions of your Mind, </l>
        <l>As Fishmongers say by their Wares, the Play </l>
        <l>And Poet too are fresh and new as they. </l>
        <l>Novelties use to please you, but of late </l>
        <l>Nothing will do, such is your cruel Fate: </l>
        <l>We court your Love, but still we meet our Hate. </l>
        <l>If you resolve still to be so severe </l>
        <l>Thus few will try their Wits to treat you here, </l>
        <l>But spend what's left, where Men more kind will prove </l>
        <l>At least they will return us Love for Love. </l>
        <l>They're void of Care and Strife wee'l spend our Days </l>
        <l>In Love and Friendship, and ne're think of Plays. </l>
        <l>'Tis the first Fault, and therefore Sirs be kind, </l>
        <l>And let the Play a kind Reception find. </l>
