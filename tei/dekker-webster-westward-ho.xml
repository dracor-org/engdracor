Shee that must weare this gowne if she wil receiue it, is Maister Iustinianos wife (the Italian Marchant) my good old Lord and Maister, that hath beene a Tylter this twenty yeere, hath sent it. Mum Taylor, you are a kinde of Bawd. Taylor, if this Gentlewomans Husband should chance to bee in the way now, you shall tell him that I keepe a Hot-house in Gunpowder Ally (neere crouched Fryers) and that I haue brought home his wiues foule Linnen, and to colour my knauery the better, I have heere three or foure kindes of complexion, which I will make shewe of to sell vnto her: the young Gentlewoman hath a good Citty wit, I can tell you, shee hath red in the Italian Courtyer, that it is a speciall ornament to gentlewomen to haue skill in painting. </p>

Your Cittizens wife learnes nothing but fopperies of your Ladie, but your Lady or Iustice-a-peace Madam, carries high wit from the Citty, namely, to receiue all and pay all: to awe their Husbands, to check their Husbands, to controule their husbands; nay, they haue the tricke ont to be sick for a new gowne, or a Carcanet, or a Diamond, or so: and I wist this is better wit, then to learne how to weare a Scotch Farthingale: nay more. </p>

I haue receiued here a letter from my wife▪ directed to Stode, wherein shee most repentantly intreateth my return, with protestation to gyue me assured tryall of her honesty. I cannot tell what to thinke of it, but I will put it to the test, there is a great strife betweene beautie, &amp; Chastity, and that which pleaseth many is neuer free from temtation: as for Iealousie, it makes many Cuckoldes, many fooles, and many banquerouts: It may haue abused me and not my wifes honesty: Ile try it: but first to my secure and doting Companion. </p>
