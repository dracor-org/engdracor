     To His GRACE, The Duke of Ormond, Lord Steward of His Majesties Houshold, Knight of the Noble Order of the Garter, One of His MAJESTIES most Honourable Privy Council, &amp;c.

    <opener>
     <salute>
      May it please your GRACE,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     THE Arrogance a Poet may be guilty of in a Dedication, often brings him more terror, than his fear for the success of his Play; and I always thought the Frowns of an offended Patron a greater Punishment than the Censures of the Partial Criticks. But the Sin of Confidence is so natural to a young Poet, and so suitable to his Character and Business, that an Excuse, or Reproof (as it would be extreamly unnecessary, so it) might perhaps be a hinderance to his Fortune. My sence of this, has encourag'd me to present this Comedy to your Grace; with this humble Suit, That as it has indifferently past in the Opinion of the Town, it may have the Honour to stand as Neuter in your Graces Favour:
     <pb xml:id="ep000544-003-a"/>
     The greatest Confidence of a Poet can ask no more; nor can you,
     <hi>
      (My Lord
     </hi>
     ) Govern'd by your Excellent Temper, grant less. This I know I need not repeat, nor urge a second time: For who ever yet made an Humble Address to your Grace, that went away unsatisfied? You are so far from Singularity, so Nobly Iust, and so unwearied in doing good, that to Pen your Applause, were as impossible a work, as to Pen the Actions of your Life, every hour producing some memorable thing as an Addition to the Volume.
     <hi>
      My Lord
     </hi>
     , 'Tis not only my particular Grief, but every ones for your Graces departure from England: And though the great Place of Trust conferred upon you by His
     <hi>
      Sacred Majesty
     </hi>
     , (and which none can be more worthy of) gives us proof as well of your Pious Loyalty, as Unequal'd Grandeur; Yet such an Influence you have gain'd on all Hearts, that they had rather the Kingdom of Ireland should lose its Preserver, than they so good a Patron. This I confess I am most sensible of, perhaps having as much cause as any; which Relation I'll smother, lest it is thought Interest more than Gratitude makes me resent it.
    </p>
    <pb xml:id="ep000544-003-b"/>
    <p>
     If I have presumed too much, I have this Excuse, That a Dedication to such a Person cannot be Writ without it; and 'tis the only Honour a Poet is ambitious of, to have a great Name before his Play. I confess I was guilty of this; and have only this Excuse for the Arrogance of a Dedication, That your Grace was pleas'd to favour my Last, and that this was Writ with the same Integrity. For the Play I can say nothing; only that it was my own, though some are pleas'd to doubt the contrary, (the
     <hi>
      Scotch Song
     </hi>
     excepted, a part of which was not mine; nor do I desire any Reputation from it.) Be pleased,
     <hi>
      My Lord
     </hi>
     , to forgive this Prolixity; and believe my sence of the Honour I have in Addressing to your Grace, almost equals the Ambition I shall ever own, in Stiling my Self,

     Prologue.

    <l>
     IF Plot and Bus'ness Comical and New,
    </l>
    <l>
     Could please the Criticks that sit here to view,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Poet might have thought this Play would do.
    </l>
    <l>
     But in this Age Design no praise can get:
    </l>
    <l>
     You cry it Conversation wants, and Wit;
    </l>
    <l>
     As if the Obvious Rules of Comedy,
    </l>
    <l>
     Were only dull Grimace and Repart&#233;e.
    </l>
    <l>
     Such, Sirs, have been your Darlings prov'd of late:
    </l>
    <l>
     The Author therefore careless of his Fate,&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     And knowing Wit a Chattle hardly got,
    </l>
    <l>
     Has ventur'd his whole Stock upon a Plot:
    </l>
    <l>
     He says a Mock-Song, or a Smutty Tale,&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Can please the Town; and why not this prevail?&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     I friendly told him, all that I could say,
    </l>
    <l>
     Was, that your Fancies lean'd the other way;
    </l>
    <l>
     And you lov'd Wenching better than his Play.
    </l>
    <l>
     For th' Body still you Luxury prepare;
    </l>
    <l>
     But let the Mind be desolate and bare:
    </l>
    <l>
     Thus lose your selves in the Worlds prudent thought,&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Then strive to get Reprieve by finding fault.
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      A Critick is a Monster that can sway
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Only o'er Ignorance, and yet dares prey
     </hi>

      Upon that Power that form'd him out of Clay.&#8212;

    <l>
     Adulterate Age, where Prudence is a Vice,&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     And Wit's as scandalous as Avarice:&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet in despight of this,&#8212; y'are Poets too;
    </l>
    <l>
     And what two Fops rail at, a third shall do.
    </l>
    <l>
     Upon our Priviledges you incroach,
    </l>
    <l>
     And with dull Rhimes the Noble Art debauch.
    </l>
    <l>
     For Writing Plays you scorn a Poets Name;
    </l>
    <l>
     A Bawdy Song's enough to get you fame:
    </l>
    <l>
     Where midst the Reputation that is due,
    </l>
    <l>
     You will be sure no man shall censure you.
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet though your Faction does infest the Town,
    </l>
    <l>
     There is a wise Cabal dares judge and own
    </l>
    <l>
     Desert and Wit, and our Endeavours Crown:
    </l>
    <l>
     To these we humbly Dedicate our Plays,
    </l>
    <l>
     Whilst at their Feet our Poets throw their Bays.

        Never doubt your Husband, Madam, he has so strange a confidence in my fidelity, that to possess him otherwise, were utterly to take away the little sence is left him. You know he brought me to lodge in his house, which prudently I refus'd at first, and seemingly fled from the Heav'n I desir'd, to make him more importunate: Since I came here, you know how he has carrest me; and to colour my design, and divert you, have feign'd a Mistriss in this quarter of the Town; and then, as if I spoke of her, have told him all that has past betwixt my self and you, at which the good-natur'd Creature has laught extreamly, and wisht me good luck a thousand times; and can we now doubt further success?

He stood and heard it, and often would laugh heartily to hear himself notoriously abused.

        MAnage it but carefully, you need not doubt the consequence: I have already possest my Husband with a belief of our variance, and I know he's coming up with an intent to reconcile us. I'll not be seen; the rest is your part, carry it but handsomly, and Ranger's

But what bus'ness can your Sister have with you? The Devil and She have been plotting together about this Intrigue.

My kindness to Mr. Rashley was only because&#8212; he promis'd to be my Friend in urging my Reconcilement with you;&#8212; and because I knew he was your Friend, I therefore&#8212; I say, because I knew you lov'd him, I desir'd him to&#8212; to&#8212; I was very urgent with him&#8212; about&#8212; about&#8212; No I mistake! 'twas he was urgent with me to intreat you to do me the favour&#8212; no&#8212; to do him the favour: I mean, hum&#8212; to&#8212; to&#8212;

        Right, Madam; and by this a Man may see how unnecessary a thing it is,&#8212; to strive to turn the current of a Womans fancy, when it is bent to another. 'Tis a damn'd thing this Wenching, if a Man considers seriously on it; and yet 'tis such a damnable Age we live in, that, Gad, he that does not follow it is either accounted sordidly unnatural, or ridiculously impotent.&#8212; Well, for my part henceforward this shall be my Resolution:

     WEll, Gentlemen, how d'ee?&#8212; Icod you sit,
    </l>
    <l>
     As if you had no Souls, no Brains, no Wit.
    </l>
    <l>
     What, not a word now in the Poets praise?
    </l>
    <l>
     Hah!&#8212; Faith, I was a Spark in my young days.&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     I Clapt, and Clapt;&#8212; nay, sometimes to my cost:
    </l>
    <l>
     I Clapt so long,&#8212; Gad, I (was) Clapt at last.
    </l>
    <l>
     There I was waggish;&#8212; You know what I mean;&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     The Devil was in't, a Plaguy Yorkshire Quean.&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     But 'tis no matter,&#8212; 'twas but thought a Iest,
    </l>
    <l>
     And, Gad, I was as brisk then as the best.
    </l>
    <l>
     So I am now; for Ifack I'd have you know,
    </l>
    <l>
     Your Old Man, though he only serve for show,
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet give him a Young Wench with Black o' Top,&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     And you shall see him Frisk, and Iump, and Hop;&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Icod, and Wriggle!&#8212; Hah!&#8212; th' old Bell will sound,
    </l>
    <l>
     Though there is ne'er a Clapper to be found.
    </l>
    <l>
     But let that pass: Now your Applause disburse;
    </l>
    <l>
     Why,&#8212; what the Devil makes you silent thus?&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     What say ye,&#8212; The Play does not deserve it?&#8212; Hah!&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     Icod, you are mistaken:&#8212; for I'll tell ye,
    </l>
    <l>
     I once could Write and Iudge,&#8212; and ' Fack did do
    </l>
    <l>
     Very strange things;&#8212; but I've forgot 'um now:&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     But I remember what a Wag&#8212; I was:&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     I had so many Smutty Iests those days,
    </l>
    <l>
     I could get none but Women to my Plays.
    </l>
    <l>
     But that's all one;&#8212; Icod, the Youth that Writ,
    </l>
    <l>
     Does well;&#8212; and who knows,&#8212; may do better yet:
    </l>
    <l>
     Therefore you should incourage him, D'ee hear?
    </l>
    <l>
     And he that fails, I wish this Curse may bear,

    <l>
     That he be really my Character,&#8212;

    <l>
     Lascivious, Deaf, and Impotent as I;
