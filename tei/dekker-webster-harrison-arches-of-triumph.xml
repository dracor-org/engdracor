        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE SIR THOMAS BENNET KNIGHT, LORD MAIOR OF THIS CITIE, THE RIGHT WORSHIPFULl the Aldermen his Brethren, and to those Worshipfull Commoners, elected Committies, for the Managing of this Businesse. </head>
        <p>THE loue which I beare to your Honour and Worships: and the duty wherewith I am bound to this honourable Citie, makes me appeare in this boldnesse to you; To whome I humbly Consecrate these fruites of my inuention, which Time hath nowe at length brought foorth, and ripened to this perfection. That Magnificent Royalty, and glorious Entertainement, which you your selues for your part, out of a free, a cleare, and verie bounteous disposition, and so many thousands of woorthie Citizens, out of a sincere affection and loyalty of his Maiestie, did with the sparing of no cost, bestowe but vpon one day, is here newe wrought vp againe, and shall endure for euer. For albeit those Monuments of your Loues were erected vp to the Cloudes, and were built neuer so strongly, yet now their lastingnes should liue but in the tongues and memories of men: But that the hand of Arte giues them here a second more perfect beeing, aduaunceth them higher then they were before, and warrants them that they shall doe honour to this Citie, so long as the Citie shall beare a name. Sory I am that they come into the world no sooner: but let the hardnesse of the labour; and the small number of handes, that were busied about them, make the faulte (if it bee a faulte) excusable. I would not care if these vnpainted Pictures were more Costly to me, so that they might appeare curious enough to your Lordship and Worships; yet in regard, that this present Age can lay before you no President that euer any in this land performed the like, I presume these my endeuours shall receiue the more worthie liking of you. And thus Dedicating my Labours and Loue to your honourable and kinde Acceptations, I most humbly take my leaue, this 16 of Iune 1604. </p>

        <head>The Deuice called Londinium. </head>
        <p>THese fiue Triumphall Arches were first taken in hand in the beginning of Aprill 1603. presently after his Maiesty was proclaimed. It being expected that his passage would haue bene through his honourable City and Chamber to his Coronation vpon Saint Iames his day following: But by reason of the sicknesse, it pleased his Maiestie to be solemnely Crowned at Westminster, without sight of these Triumphs: Notwithstanding the businesse being set on foote, went on with all expedition; till Bartholmew-tide and then ceased because of the great mortalitie, 40. dayes more was giuen for the preparing of this Triumphall Arch. In which time, the streetes for that purpose were diligently surueyed, heights, breadths and distances taken, as it were to make Fortisications for the solemnities: Seuen peeces of ground like so many fields for a battell) were plotted forth, vpon which these Triumphes should be erected: The gladsome and long desired Morning at length is come, In which the Streetes seeme to bee paued with people, that in heapes flocke together, to behold their proud heads that were aduanced in this manner. </p>
        <p>THE first Pegme was erected in Fanchurch-streete, the backe of it so learning on the East ende of the Church, that it ouer-spread the whole streete. And thus we describe it. </p>
        <p>It was a Flat-square, builded vpright; the Perpendicular-line of the whole Frame, (that is to say, the distance from the bottome to the top,) as the Ground-line, is (also in this, so in all the rest) to be found out and tried by the Scale, diuided by 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5. and set at the lower end of the Peece: By which figures feete are represented: So that in all the descriptions, where mention is to bee made of Heights, Breadths, or any other Commensurable proportions, you shall find them left thus— with a blancke, because we wish you rather to apply them to the Scale your selfe, then by setting them downe, to call either your skill or iudgement in question. </p>
        <p>And note withall, that the Ground-plot hath not the same Scale which the vpright hath, for of the two Scales, which you see annexed, the Lesser is of the Ground, and standeth in the Ground-plot, the Greater, for the Edifice or Building it selfe. </p>
        <p>This Gate of Passage, then (into which his Maiesty made his first entrance) was deriued from the Tuscana (beeing the principal pillar of those 5. vpon which the Noble Frame of Architecture doth stand,) for the Tuscane Columne is the strongest &amp; most worthy to support so famous a Worke, as this Fabricke was, considering that vpon his Rusticke Pillars, the goodliest Houses, Turrets, Steeples, &amp;c. within this City, were to be borne: And those Models, stood as a Coronet on the forehead or Battlements of this Great and Magnificent Edifice. </p>
        <p>The cheekes or sides of the Gate, were (as it were) doubly guarded with the Pottraitures of Atlas King of Mauritania, who (according to his owne shortnesse and thicknesse) from the Symetry of his foote, caused a pillar to be made, whose height with Base and Capitall was 6. times the thicknesse in height. And so is this of ours, bearing the name of Tuscana, as we sayd before, and reaching to the very point of the Arch, from whence wee did deriue Dorica which bore vp the Architiue, Frize, and Coronixe, and was garnished with Corbels or Croxtels fitting such worke, besides the beauty of Pyramids, Beasts, Water, Tables, and many other inrichments, which you may find exprest in the Peece it selfe. </p>
        <p>From a Gallery directly ouer the gate, the sound of loud Musicke (being the Waites and Hault-boyes of the City) was sent forth. </p>
        <p>At the foot of the Battlements was in Capitall letters inscribed this word Londinium, &amp; beneath that, these words Camera Regia. </p>
        <p>In this Pegme or Arch Triumphall, were placed 12. personages, of which she that had the preeminence to sit highest, was cald Monarchia Britannica. </p>
        <p>At her feete sate Diuine Wisedome. <list>
            <head>On her right hand sate three of the daughters of Genius Vrbis, whose names were </head>
            <item>Veneration, </item>
            <item>Promptitude, </item>
            <item>Vigilance: </item>
          </list>
          <list>
            <head>On her left, the other three, viz. </head>
            <item>Gladnesse, </item>
            <item>Louing Affection, </item>
            <item>Vnanimitte. </item>
          </list>
        </p>
        <p>Beneath all these stood the Genius of the Citty, richly attirde, being supported on the right hand by a person figuring The Councell of the City; and on the left by a person figuring the Warlike force of the City. </p>
        <p>Directly vnder these, in an Abacke thrust out before the rest, lay Thamesis the Riuer, leaning his Arme vpon a Gourde, out of which, water with liue fishes were seene to runne forth, and play about him. </p>
        <p>The speakers were onely Thamesis and Genius, who vttered these speeches following on the other side. </p>

The lower parte of this Building, was a large square, garnished with foure great Corinthia Columnes: In the midst of which square, was cut out a faire and a Spacious hie gate, Arched, being— foote in the Perpendicular-line, and— in the Ground-line: directly ouer the gate were aduaunced the Armes of the Kingdome, the Supporters whereof were fairely cut out to the life. </p>
        <p>On the top of this first square (beeing flat) was erected another Square which bare in the fore side foure more lesser Columnes, on which were all the garnishments belonging to those pillars: as namely, the architriue frize and Cornish, on which Square was placed a great Canted Pedestall, which with his moldinges did diminish vpwards to smaller Cants, on which top was fixed a Personage carued or molded out to the life, her left hand leaning on a sword, with the point downeward, and her right hand reaching forth a Diademe, which, shee seemde by bowing of her knee and head, to bestow vpon his Maiestie. </p>
        <p>On the foure Corners of this vpper parte, stoode foure naked Portractures (in great) with artificiall trumpets in their hands. </p>

        <p>The Italians, were placed within two little Galleries very richly and stately hung, vnder the Arch of the Passage: In whose behalfe, thus much Latine was deliuered. </p>

        <head>The Pegme of the Dutchmen. </head>
        <p>THE third welcome that his Maiesty receiude, was from the Belgians, who had builded a stately Triumphall Arch, to entertaine him in, and thus was it contriude. </p>
        <p>So wide did the bodie of it extend it selfe, that it swallowed vp the breadth of the whole streete, neere the Royall Exchange in Cornehill. The Passage of state was a gate, comely, and large, ascending— foote in heigth, and— foote in the breadth, neately Arched, and graced with two lesser Posternes on the sides, whose dimensions you may behold in the modell. </p>
        <p>Sundry inscriptions were in golden Letters to bee seene, both ouer the Gate, and in the Tables, fild with excellent Pictures; as the King in his Imperiall Robes: with other Portractures of Princes, and Poeticall Emblemes of Peace, &amp;c. On the back part also were peeces, wherein were drawne the people of the Seuenteene Prouinces at their Husbandry; their Exchange: their Mart: Also seuenteene children on the fore side, representing the seuenteene Prouinces, sate in degrees, each of them hauing a Scutcheon in his hand, figuring his Prouince. </p>
        <p>On the shoulders of this Belgicke body, stood rowes of Balysters with Pedistals, that supported Lyons rampant, bearing vp Banners: And aboue them in the midst of another square about with Balysters likewise, was aduanced a woman (figuring Diuine Prouidence, her feete fastned to a great Pedestall, whose toppe was curiously connexed and knit together with the tailes of two Dolphins. </p>
        <p>Other Garnishments there were that gaue illustration and beauty to this building, as Columnes, Pyramids, &amp;c. whose proportions your eye may measure on the other side.

          <p>GREAT King, those so many Scepters, which euen fill thy right hand, are all thine owne, onely by the Prouidence of heauen. Behold, heauen it selfe laughes to see thy Subiects smile, and thunder out loud Plaudities, to heare their Aues. This honor of Soueraignty beeing at the beginning of the world bestowed but vpon few; vpon the heads of few were the cares of a Crowne set, for to sway onely but one Empire (happily) as it is a labour hard: So none can vndergoe the waight but such as are mightie: But (with a becke as it were) to controle many Nations (and those of different dispositions too) O! the Arme of man can neuer do that, but the finger of God. God therefore (that guides the Chariot of the world) holds the Raynes of thy Kingdome in his owne hand: It is he whose beames lend a light to thine. It is hee that teacheth thee the Art of Ruling, because none but hee made thee a King. And therefore as thou growest in yeares, thou waxest old in Vertues: of all thy Vertues, Religion sitting highest. And most worthy; for by Religion, the hearts of barbarous Nations are made soft: By Religion, Rebellion hath a yoke cast about her necke, and is brought to beleeue, that those Lawes to which thou submittest euen thy royall selfe, are most easie. With Religion Iustice keepes companie, who once fled from this prophane world, but hearing the name of King Iames she is againe returned. By her side sits her sister Fortitude, whose life is readie (in Heroike actions) to bee spent for the safety of thy people. Besides to make these Vertues full, Apollo and the Muses, resigne, the one his Golden lyre, the other their Laurell, to thy royall hands, whilest Plenty (daughter to Industry) layes the blessings both of Countrey and Cittie in heapes at thy feete. These are the gifts of heauen: the fame then spreading it selfe so farre, that (to wonder at them) both the Poles seeme to come together. We (the Belgians) likewise come, to that intent: a Nation banisht from our owne Cradles, yet nurst and brought vp in the tender bosome of a Princely mother, Eliza. The loue which we once dedicated to her (as a Mother) doubly do We vowe it to thee, our Soueraigne, and Father: Intreating wee may bee sheltred vnder thy wings now, as vnder hers: Our Prayers beeing, that he who through the loynes of so many Kingdomes, may likewise multiply thy years, and lengthen them out to the age of a Phoenix: And that thy Queene (who is one part of thy selfe) with thy Progeny (who are the second hopes of thy people,) may both giue too, and receiue from, thy Kingdome Immortall glory. </p>

        <p>This was beautified with a large Gate in the midst: On each side was cut out a Posterne, either of which was— foot wide, and— foot high: before which Posternes two Portals were built from the same, hauing their sides open foure seuerall wayes, and seruing as Pedestals (of Rusticke) to support two great Pyramids, whose bases were held vp with foure great Bals, and foure Lyons. </p>

        <p>Directly vnder her, in a wide hollow square, were exalted fiue greene Mounts, the one swelling aboue the other; vpon which the fiue Senses, (Hearing, Seeing, Feeling, Smelling and Taste,) sate heauily drooping: before which Mounts, an Artificiall Lauer was erected, called the Fount of Vertue; out of which (from sundry pipes) vpon his Maiesties approach, ranne wine very plenteously. </p>
        <p>At the foote of this Fount lay Detraction and Obliuion, Sleeping till his Maiesties approach; but beeing arriued at the place, and the Trompe of Fame, starting vp the Senses, they two likewise awaked, doing their best, with clubs to beate downe the Fount, but were hindered by the Senses, and a person representing Circumspection. </p>
        <p>Vpon seuerall Ascensions, (and close adioyning to the Pyramids,) were seated at one side, the three Graces, and on the other side the three Howres. </p>

        <head>The Deuice called, Hortus Euporiae, Garden of Plentie. </head>
        <p>THE fift Pegme was a sommer Arbor, and seemed to growe close to the little Conduit in Cheape, which ioyning to the backe of it, serued (or might bee supposed to haue bene) as a Fountaine to water the fruits of this Garden of Plenty. </p>
        <p>This greene bower spread it selfe likewise (as all the rest did) ouer the whole breadth of the streete; hauing two Gates arched and grated Arbor-wise, to the height of— feete, and breadth of—: the sides of which gates were borne vp with foure great French termes, standing vpon Pedestals, which conteined in their full height— foote. Betweene these open Passages were a paire of staires mounted, at the bottome of which (on two pillers) were fixed two Satyres, carued out in wood. Both the roofe and sides of these Gates, were Artificially hung with Pompions, Cowcumbers, Grapes, Cherries, Peares, Apples, and all other fruits, which the land bringeth foorth. The vpper part also (which was closed with three round tops, Fortune standing on the midst of the three) was garnished with lesser fruits, and with all sorts of Flowers, made by Art. </p>
        <p>The whole Frame of this sommer house, stood (at the Ground-line) vppon— foote, the Perpendicular, stretching it selfe to—. </p>
        <p>Peace and Plentie had the highest places in this Bower, and sate to gether: directly vnder them, sate two other persons, representing Gold and Siluer, supporting the Globe of the world betweene them: On each side of them sate two other persons, the one Pomona, Goddesse of Fruits, the other Ceres, Goddesse of Corne. </p>
        <p>Vpon two large Descents (a little belowe these) were placed at one ende the nine Muses, at the other end the seuen liberall Sciences. </p>

          <p>MOST happie Prince, pardon me, that beeing meane in habite, and wild in appearance (for my richest liuery is but leaues, and my stateliest dwelling but in the woods) thus rudely with piping Syluanes, I presume to intercept your Royall passage. These are my walkes, yet stand I not here to cut off your way, but to giue it a full and a bounteous welcome, beeing a messenger sent from the Lady Eirene my mistresse; those that sleepe vnder the warmth of her winges adore her by the Sacred aud Celestiall name of Peace; her daughter Euporia (well knowne by the name of Plenty) is at this present with her, (being indeed neuer from her side:) Vnder yonder Arbor they sit, which after the daughters name is called Hortus Euporiae (Plenties Bower.) Chast are they both, and both maidens, in memory of a Virgine to whom they were Nurse-children, for whose sake (because they were bound to her for their life) me haue they charged to lay at your Imperiall feete, (being your hereditary due) the tribute of their loue. And with it thus to say. That they haue languished many heauy moneths for your presence, which to them would haue bene, (and proud they are that it shall be now so) of the same operation and influence, that the Sunne is to the Spring, and the Spring to the Earth; hearing therefore what treble preferment you haue bestowed vpon this day, wherein besides the beames of a glorious Sunne, two other cleere and gracious Starres shine cheerefully on these her homely buildings; Into which (because no duty should be wanting) she hath giuen leaue euen to Strangers, to be sharers in her happinesse, by suffering them to bid you likewise welcome: By me (once hers, now your vassaile) shee intreates, and with a knee sinking lower then the ground on which you treade, do I humbly execute her pleasure, that ere you passe further, you would deigne to walke into yonder Garden. The Hesperides liue not there, but the Muses, and the Muses no longer than vnder your protection. Thus farre am I sent to conduct you thither, prostrately begging this grace (since I dare not, as being vnworthy, Lackey by your Royall side) that yet these my greene Followers and my selfe may be Ioyfull forerunners of your expected approch. Away Syluans. </p>

        <p>The liuely garnishments to this Building were 23 persons, of which the principall and worthiest was Astraea (Iustice) who was aduanced to the highest Seate: Beneath her in a Cant by her selfe, Arete (Vertue) was placed: and at her feete Fortune, who trod vpon the Globe. </p>
        <p>In a darke and obscure place (neere Vertue) sate Enuy: beneath whom, on seuerall Ascensions were placed the Cardinall Vertues, Iustice, Fortitude, Temperance and Prudence; and in an opposite seate, the foure kingdomes, England, Scotland, France and Ireland. </p>

        <head>The Deuice called, Templum Iani, Temple of Ianus. </head>
        <p>THE seuenth and last Pegme (within the Citie) was erected at Temple-barre, beeing adioyned close to the Gate: The Building was in all points like a Temple, and dedicated to Ianus Quadrifrons. </p>
        <p>Beneath that Foure-fac'd head of Ianus was aduancd the Armes of the Kingdome, with the Supporters cut out to the life: from whence being remoude they now are placed in the Guild Hall. </p>
        <p>The wals and gates of this Temple were brasse; the Pillars siluer, their Capitals and Bases gold: All the Frontispice (downeward from those Armes) was beutified and supported by twelue rich Columnes, of which the foure lowermost, being great Corinthian pillers, stood vpon two large Pedestals, with a faire Vaux ouer them in stead of Architriue, Frieze and Cornice: Aboue them, eight Columnes more, were likewise set, two and two vpon a large Pedestall; for as our worke began (for his Maiesties entrance) with Rusticke, so did wee thinke it fit, that this out Temple, should end with the most famous Columne, whose beauty and goodlinesse is deriued both from the Tuscane, Doricke, Ionicke and Corinthian, and receiued his full perfection from Titus Vespasian, who aduanced it to the highest place of dignitie in his Arch Triumphall, and (by reason that the beauties of it were a mixture taken from the rest) he gaue it the name of Composita or Italica: within the Temple stood an Altar, with burning Incense vpon it, before which a Flamin appears, and to the Flamin comes the Genius of the City. The principall person in this Temple, was Peace. At her feete lay Warre groueling. At her right hand stood Wealth. On the same hand likewise, but somewhat remote, and in a Cant by her selfe, Quiet was seated, the first hand maide of Peace, whose feete stood vpon Tumult. On the left hand (at the former distance) Liberty the second hand-maide of Peace had her place, at whose feete Seruitude lay subiected. Beneath these (on distinct degrees) sate two other hand maides of Peace, Safety and Felicity, Safety trampling vpon Danger and Felicity vpon Vnhappinesse. Genius and Flamin spake thus much. </p>

        <p>Nor shall it be amisse in this place to giue thee intelligence of some matters (by way of notes) which were not fully obserude, nor freely inough set downe in the Printed Booke of these Triumphes: amongst which these that follow are chiefest. </p>
        <p>His Maiestie departed from the Tower betweene the houres of 11. and 12 and before 5. had made his royall passage through the Citie, hauing a Canopie borne ouer him by 8. Knights. </p>
        <p>The first Obiect that his Maiesties eye encountred (after his entrance into London) was part of the children of Christs Church Hospitall, to the number of 300. who were placed on a Scaffold, erected for that purpose in Barking Church-yard by the Tower. </p>
        <p>The way from the Tower to Temple-Barre was not onely sufficiently grauelled, but all the streetes (lying betweene those two places) were on both sides (where the breadth would permit) raild in at the charges of the Citie, Paules Church-yard excepted. </p>
        <p>The Liueries of the Companies (hauing their Streamers, Ensignes, and Banerets spred on the tops of their railes before them) reached from the middle of Marke Lane, to the Pegme at Temple Barre. </p>
        <p>Two Marshals were chosen for the day, to cleere the passage both of them being well mounted, and attended on by sixe men (suteably attirde) to each Marshall. </p>
        <p>The Conduits of Cornehill, of Cheape, and of Fleetestreete, that day ran Claret wine very plenteously: which (by reason of so much excellent Musicke, that sounded foorth not onely from each seuerall Pegme, but also from diuerse other places) ran the faster and more merrily downe into some bodies bellies. </p>
        <p>As touching the Oration vttered by Sir Henry Mountague (Recorder of the City) with the gifts bestowed on the King, the Queene, and the Prince (beeing three Cups of gold) as also, all such songs, as were that day sung in the seuerall Arch's, I referre you to the Booke in print, where they are set downe at large. </p>
        <p>And thus much you shall vnderstand, that no manner of person whatsoever, did disburse any part towards the charge of these fiue Triumphes, but onely the meere Citizens being all free-men; heretofore the charge being borne by fifteenes and the Chamber of London (as may appear by auncient presidents) but now it was leauied amongst the Companies. The other two Arch's erected by Merchant-Strangers (viz the Italians and Dutchmen) were only their owne particular charge. </p>
        <p>The Citty elected 16. Committies to whom the managing of the whole businesse was absolutely referred: of which number 4. were Aldermen, the other 12. Commoners, viz. one out of each of the 12. Companies. Other Committies were also appointed as ouer-seers and surueyors of the worke. Farewell. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
