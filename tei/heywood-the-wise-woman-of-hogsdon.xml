              <p>You before, Ile follow. He thinkes with his blunt humour, to enter as farre as I with my sharpe: No, my true Trojan, no: There is a faire sweet modest rogue, her name is Luce: with this Dandiprat, this pretty little Apes face, is yon blunt fellow in love; and no marvell, for shee hath a Browe bewitching, Eyes ravishing, and a Tongue enchanting: And indeed shee hath no fault in the world but one, and that is, shee is honest: and were it not for that, shee were the onely sweet Rogue in Christendome. As I live, I love her extreamely, and to enjoy her would give any thing: But the foole stands in her owne light, and will doe nothing without Marriage: but what should I doe marrying? I can better indure Gives, than Bands of Matrimonie. But in this Meditation, I am glad I have wonne my Money againe. Nay, and shee may be glad of it too: for the Girle is but poore, and in my pockett I have layd up a Stocke for her, 'tis put to use alreadie. And if I meete not with a Dyce-house, or an Ordinary by the way, no question but I may increase it to a summe. Well, Ile unto the Exchange to buy her some prettie Noveltie: That done, Ile visite my little Rascall, and sollicite instantly. </p>

There's another in Coleharbour, that's skill'd in the Planets. Mother Sturton in Goulden-lane, is for Forespeaking: Mother Phillips of the Banke-side, for the weaknesse of the backe: and then there's a very reverent Matron on Clarkenwell-Green, good at many things: Mistris Mary on the Banke- side, is for recting a Figure: and one (what doe you call her) in Westminster, that practiseth the Booke and the Key, and the Sive and the Sheares: and all doe well, according to their talent. For my selfe, let the world speake: harke you my friend, you shall takeâ€” </p>

              <p>Gratiana! oft have I heard of her, but saw her <pb xml:id="ep000077-018-b"/>not till now: 'tis a prettie wench, a very prettie wench, nay, a very, very, very prettie wench. But what a Rogue am I, of a married man? nay, that have not beene married this six houres, and to have my shittle-wits runne a Wooll-gathering already? What would poore Luce say if shee should heare of this? I may very well call her poore Luce, for I cannot presume of five pounds to her portion: what a Coxcombe was I, being a Gentleman, and well deriv'd, to match into so beggarly a kindred? What needed I to have grafted in the stocke of such a Choake Peare, and such a goodly Popering as this to escape mee? Escape mee (said I?) if shee doe, shee shall doe it narrowly: but I am married already, and therefore it is not possible, unlesse I should make away my wife, to compasse her. Married! why who knowes it? Ile out-face tho Priest, and then there is none but shee and her Father, and their evidence is not good in Law: and if they put mee in suite, the best is, they are poore, and cannot follow it. I marry Sir, a man may have some credit by such a Wife as this; I could like this marriage well, if a man might change away his Wife, still as hee is a weary of her, and cope her away like a bad commoditie: if every new Moone a man might have a new Wife, that's every yeare a dozen. But this, Till Death us depart, is tedious: I will goe a wooing to her, I will; but how shall I doe for jewels and tokens? Luce hath mine in her custodie, money and all; tush, Ile juggle them from her well enough: see, here shee comes. </p>
