        <p>THO the Favour my generous and worthy Friends have done me in vindicating this COMEDY against the ridiculous Malice of a prejudiced Party be very considerable, and I ought to be extreamly well satisfied with my present good Fortune, yet is not my Contentment perfect, till I am so happy to lay it to your Feet; and by your unquestion'd Merit, Iudgment and noble Patronage, secure the Credit of these printed Sheets in the reading, as the Applause of the Impartial, and Iudicious, have already done in the Presentation. </p>
        <p>The Character your Lordship leaves amongst all Persons of Honour and Worth, has encourag'd my Ambition to aspire to this honour; and tho' the Trifle which I humbly Dedicate to you, has not merit enough to defend me from being thought too presuming, yet the dutious Desire and Zeal I have to serve your Lordship, and express my Gratitude for your abundant Favours all manner of ways, will I'm sure, by your generous Nature, that never frown'd on an addressing Author, nor discourag'd Wit, tho' in its meanest quality, be receiv'd as I intend it. I have too long had the Honour and Happiness to know your Lordship to be Ignorant of your great Modesty, when you are oblig'd to hear any thing relating to your own Praise; and I m&#242;st humbly beg you to believe, that I have not so much of the Authors common Quality, and which we see so generally us'd in all Dedications, that I do pretend to flatter Merit like Yours, or offend your Eyes with an Encomium upon your Virtues, which perhaps no Poet has Wit or Skill enough to do you Iustice in, and which your uncommon Modesty, and admir'd Humility I'm sure would discourage in us if we could. </p>
        <p>The Panegyrical Part then of a Dedication, which I confess I cannot for fear to think reasonable here, because I know it would be just in a manner quite laid aside, for what can I say in your Praise that our little World here does not already know, your Early Courage and Bravery of Soul, has made its Course like the Sun, and in relation to Europe, has almost extended it self as far, especially where Honour was to be got, or any glorious Action was going forward; and as I believe 'tis impossible for any Person <pb xml:id="ep000549-003-a"/>to give a better accompt of the Sieges of Vienna or Buda then your self, you omitting no Enterprise that could either signalize your Courage, or satisfie your Curiosity so 'tis as obvious to the World, that the Great Leopaldus by the glorious Spread Eagle, so royally bestowed and nobly added to your Houshold Coat, sufficiently gave a Testimony that nothing but extraordinary Worth could be capable of gaining such an Honour. </p>
        <p>This my Lord is so poor a Diminution of so extensive a Merit, that I'm afraid I shall rather be accused of Injustice than Flattery: for saying any thing in your Praise could not be done without saying much more than this, especially should I consider like a right Author, that the Muses are as much oblig'd to you for your generous Incouragement and Protection, as your Country is for Loyalty, Love and Resolution. </p>
        <p>To be Patron both of Arts and Arms is a Title my Lord worthy of you, and which the Actions of your Life daily demonstrate, that you will more and more deserve, for whilst the Sons of Mars admire your Experience in War, and the Sons of Apollo your acquirements of Wit and Iudgment, no Name can appear fairer in the Book of Fame, nor no Worth better deserve to have a Subscription there. </p>
        <p>And as I cannot, my Noble Lord, but think it very reasonable for extraordinary Persons to be rewarded with Blessings as extraordinary; so I cannot enough express my hearts entire Ioy, that the very Best that Heaven can bestow is lately fallen upon you, in the possession of so much Vertue and Beauty, which to her lasting Fame is so gloriously exalted, that even <hi>Sacred Majesty</hi>, our never enough Renown'd <hi>Royall Mistress </hi>(than whom none is more Learn'd in the Eternal Volumes of Goodness,) is full of her Aplause, and that this extreamest Happiness which now you possess, may Crown your Days and Nights to all Eternity is the unfeign'd and real wish of </p>

        <head>PREFACE </head>
        <p>IF I were now half flustred with Drinking, and design'd to be malicious, as some of my back Friends were the first day this Play was Acted, I could make as ridiculous a description of their Behaviour in the Pit, as my Comick Characters make of others upon the Stage; but prejudice taking no effect and I owning my self sober, resolve to desist from any Acts of Hostility in that kind; and could wish that my hissing Antagonists of the <hi>Nimble Craft </hi>had as ingeniously borne a little comical Diversion where no Reflection was singular, &amp; which my courtesie &amp; good nature took such care not to expose in any particular person, rather than by a noisie exploding of what the Judges of Wit allow deserv'd it not, do themselves that Injury which I never intended, by rendring themselves fit to be laugh'd at, for seeming to be netled at what they might reasonably finde, if they had been pleased to consider it, could never give them occasion. </p>
        <p>I confess, if what has been malitiously told to some Persons of Honour (Judges of Sense and Gratitude) to whom I've the happiness to be known, were true, viz. That I liv'd at a Boarding School near London all last Summer, and in return of their hospitable Civility, writ this Play ungratefully to expose 'em, I could not defend my self from being really as guilty as they must naturally think me; but my Stars were so happy to give an occasion of satisfying these noble persons to the contrary before the Play was acted; and I now think it reasonable to inform the Reader, and the Town in general, that I never was oblig'd more than for common Courtesies <hi>(en passant</hi>) to any of 'em, which I may fairly say I have equally return'd, and without Reflexion upon their House keeping, in spite of Revolutions, have always been so lucky not to have the necessity of being troublesome to them for maintenance, or accept of any Courtesy which I could not, or did not, return. </p>
        <p>And tho after the poor and envious Injury of endeavouring to explode a thing right or wrong, I ought to be proud of my Conquest, which has done me the favour of shewing not only the power, but number of my Friends, and totally at their own Weapon routed my Enemies, yet will I not expose my self by an unnecessary boast, nor side with them in their opinion that this Comedy was writen purposely to reflect on a particular Family to whom I had a prejudice, for <pb xml:id="ep000549-004-a"/>I utterly disown any such thing; for had prejudice excited me, I might have fix'd my Characters accordingly, and given some occasion to 'em to be exasperated, which I'm sure my Comedy has not done, all the Scenes being general, and no Character nor Dress shewn particularly; nor can any Poet be blam'd for shewing this new humour of a School, when even our Senate House, nay the Church, have been contented to suffer themselves to be the Subject of our Comical Diversions; and as to the painted Scene which some cavil at, it might have been York as well as Chelsy, if the Beauty of the Place had not given me occasion to fix there. </p>
        <p>And now to shew that even our little Railery in Plays, tho intended meerly for mirth only, yet have power to disturb even the Men and Women of the greatest Sense, who are byassed by other people who mischeivously resolve to place the Reflexion upon the wrong persons, it has been to my amazement told me, that some Words in the beginning of Lady Addleplot's part, reflect upon a certain noble person now in distress, whom by all that's sacred I am and ever was so far from reflecting on, or doing the least unmanner'd Injury in that kind, that I'm sorry from my Soul for his Misfortune; and if they please to consider of the time when this Play was written, being in Iune last, they will find 'tis impossible for him, amongst all mankind, to be the Subject of that Scene, which touches no particular, nor person of Quality, but common Ruffians in general. </p>
        <p>As to the Comedy it self, the Success it has had is so well known, that I need give no Further relation, only I must acknowledge my self sensibly oblig'd both to the Patentees and Sharers for dressing it so well, and to all the Actors in general for their extraordinary performance: And as Comedy, tho never so good, lessens it self to the Reader wanting its taking Ornament of Action; so if this chance to meet with moderate liking from the Judicious, and those that have so generally appear'd my Friends, I shall beg leave to make use of a Couplet of the late famous Earl of Rochester, and say <q>
            <l>If but some few whom I omit to name </l>
            <l>Approve my sense, I count their Censure, Fame. </l>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WHen Criticks come resolv'd to damn a Muse, </l>
        <l>What Wit can please, what Prologue can excuse? </l>
        <l>'Tis vain endeavour to unblind their eyes; </l>
        <l>Of such inveterate force is prejudice, </l>
        <l>Poor harmless Plays can draw a party's hate </l>
        <l>As if 'twere Revolution of a State: </l>
        <l>And with such force your Batteries are engag'd, </l>
        <l>As if you took the Stage for Mons, besieg'd. </l>
        <l>If in a character a Fool we shew, </l>
        <l>'Tis ten to one it angers some Town Beau; </l>
        <l>Or if some boyst'rous Females Rampant Tricks </l>
        <l>That Cuckolds Husbands, and talks Politicks, </l>
        <l>As Lees part now&#8212; that straight must needs abuse </l>
        <l>Some Stickler in the Ladies Coffee House, </l>
        <l>Tho' no Reflection is intended here, </l>
        <l>And I dare swear the Poet ne're was there. </l>
        <l>Or if we shew the humours of a School </l>
        <l>Offending none, Still some will play the Fool; </l>
        <l>Some dancing Critick, in despite of Wit, </l>
        <l>Shall swear, we do it to offend his Kitt, </l>
        <l>And rashly his dull City friend possess, </l>
        <l>That our Romps here&#8212; are meant his Babes of Grace; </l>
        <l>Tho' all true Judges no Reflection find, </l>
        <l>And nothing but diversion is design'd. </l>
        <l>The Poet thinks then, finding that this is true, </l>
        <l>Implores th' assistance of the generous few, </l>
        <l>Assuring them they shall diverted be </l>
        <l>If the Malecontents will let 'em hear and see: </l>
        <l>You all can judge of Plays as well as they </l>
        <l>Party as wise, and sure pretend we may </l>
        <l>To be as strong too at this time of day. </l>
        <l>Thus low then he addresses to you all, </l>
        <l>Your favour can his doom proscrib'd recall </l>
        <l>And 'tis by you that he must stand or fall. </l>
        <l>He has done nothing here to make 'em foes, </l>
        <l>No Worth nor no Opinion does expose, </l>
        <l>But only harmless Comick humour shews. </l>
        <l>As to the Ladies. </l>
        <l>He says, he would not, nor he dares not wrong 'em </l>
        <l>There are no Romps nor rampant Wives among 'em, </l>
        <l>Nor Jilts;&#8212; yet in some hole should there be one </l>
        <l>That will make Lee's or Iiltall's part her own, </l>
        <l>Her Hiss beyond applause he must prefer, </l>
        <l>A Clap would now more pernitious be from her. </l>
