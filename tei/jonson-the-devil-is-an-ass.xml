        <l>THe DIVELL is an ASSE. That is, to day, </l>
        <l>The name of what you are met for, a new Play, </l>
        <l>Yet Grandee's, would you were not come to grace </l>
        <l>Our matter, with allowing us no place. </l>
        <l>Though you presume SATAN a subtill thing, </l>
        <l>And may have heard he's worne in a thumb-ring; </l>
        <l>Doe not on these presumptions, force us act, </l>
        <l>In compasse of a cheese-trencher. This tract </l>
        <l>Will ne're admit our vice, because of yours. </l>
        <l>Anone, who, worse then you, the fault endures </l>
        <l>That your selves make? when you will thrust and spurne, </l>
        <l>And knocke us o'the elbowes and bid, turne; </l>
        <l>As if, when we had spoke, we must be gone, </l>
        <l>Or, till we speake, must all runne in, to one; </l>
        <l>Like the young adders, at the old ones mouth? </l>
        <l>Would we could stand due North; or had no South, </l>
        <l>If that offend: or were Muscovy glasse, </l>
        <l>That you might looke our Scenes through as they passe. </l>
        <l>We know not how to affect you. If you'll come </l>
        <l>To see new Plaies, pray you affoord us roome, </l>
        <l>And shew this, but the same face you have done </l>
        <l>Your deare delight the Divell of Edmunton. </l>
        <l>Or, if, for want of roome, it must mis-carry, </l>
        <l>'Twill be but Iustice, that your censure tarry, </l>
        <l>Till you give some. And when six times you ha' seen't, </l>
        <l>If this Play doe not like, the Divell is in't. </l>
