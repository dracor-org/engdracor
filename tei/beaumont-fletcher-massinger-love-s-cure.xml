        <head>A PROLOGUE. At the reviving of this Play. </head>
        <l>STatues and Pictures challenge price and fame; </l>
        <l>If they can justly boast, and prove they came </l>
        <l>From Phidias or Apelles. None deny, </l>
        <l>Poets and Painters hold a sympathy; </l>
        <l>Yet their workes may decay and lose their grace, </l>
        <l>Receiving blemish in their limbs or face. </l>
        <l>When the minds art has this preheminence, </l>
        <l>She still retaineth her first excellence. </l>
        <l>Then why should not this deere peece be esteem'd </l>
        <l>Child to the richest fancies that ere teem'd? </l>
        <l>When not their meanest off-spring, that came forth, </l>
        <l>But bore the image of their fathers worth. </l>
        <l>Beaumonts, and Fletchers, whose desert outwayes </l>
        <l>The best applause, and their least sprig of Bayes </l>
        <l>Is worthy Phaebus; and who comes to gather </l>
        <l>Their fruits of wit, he shall not rob the treasure. </l>
        <l>Nor can you ever surfeit of the plenty, </l>
        <l>Nor can you call them rare, though they be dainty: </l>
        <l>The more you take, the more you do them right, </l>
        <l>And wee will thanke you for your own delight. </l>
