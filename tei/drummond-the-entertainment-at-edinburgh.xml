     The entertainement of the High and Mighty Monarch, Prince CHARLES, King of great Brittaine, France and Ireland, into his ancient and Royall Citie of Edenbourgh, the 15. of Iune. 1633.
    </head>
    <p>
     WITHOVT the Gate which is towards the West, where the streete ascendeth to Heroites Hospitall, did an Arch arise of height .... of breadth .... square with the battlements and inmost side of the towne-wall, the face looking to the Castle, represented a Citie situated on a rock, which with pointed Clifts, Shrubs, Trees, Herbs, and Verdure, did appeare in perspectiue upon the battlements; in great Letters was written,
     <q>
      <seg xml:lang="unk">
       &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297; &#12296;&#9674;&#12297;
      </seg>
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     As Ptolomeus nameth it: in a lesse and different Character was written.
    </p>
    <q>
     Castra Puellarum.
    </q>
    <p>
     And under that in a different colour
     <hi>
      M. Edenbourgh
     </hi>
     : The Rocke was inscribed
     <hi>
      Montagna de
      <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000345-003-a"/>
      diamant
     </hi>
     , after two Italians which gaue that name to the greatest Rocke neere Edenborough, and Cardan, who in his booke,
     <foreign xml:lang="lat">
      De rerum varietate
     </foreign>
     , highly priseth the Diamond of the Rocke.
    </p>
    <p>
     In the Freeze under the Towne was written
     <q>
      Ingredere ac nostris succede penatibus.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Vpon one side of the Towne was drawne the flood Lithus, in a Mantle of sea-greene or water colour, a Crowne of sedges and reeds on his head with long locks; his arme leaned upon an earthen pot, out of which water and fishes seemed to runne forth, in his hand hee held a bundle of flowers, over him was written
     <q>
      Picciol Mafamoso.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     On the other side of the Towne appeared Neptune bestriding his Hippocampius, the Nereides about him, his Trident in his hand, the word over him was,
     <q>
      Adsum Defensor vbique.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Theater under the Arch was a Mountaine, upon which appeared the Genius of the towne represented by a Nimph; shee was attired in a sea-greene velvet Mantle, her sleeves and under roabe of blew tissue, with blew Buskins on her feete, about her necke shee wore a chaine of Diamonds, the dressing of her head represented a Castle with turrets, her locks dangled about her shoulders; upon her right hand stood Religion all in white
     <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000345-003-b"/>
     taffeta, with a blew Mantle seeded with starres, a Crowne of starres on her head, to shew from whence she is, shee leaned her on a Scutcheon, where upon was a Crosse with the word,
     <q>
      Coelo descendet ab alto.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath her feete lay Superstition trampled, a woman blind, in old and worne garments, her Scutcheon had&#8212;
     <foreign xml:lang="lat">
      Vltra Sauromatas
     </foreign>
     . On the left-hand of this Nymph stood Iustice, a woman in a red damaske Mantle, her under garments Cloth of silver, on her head a Crowne of Gold, on a Scutcheon she had Ballances and a Sword drawn. The word was,
     <q>
      Fida regnorum Custos.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     Beneath the feet of Iustice lay Oppression trampled, a person of a fierce aspect, in armes but broken all and scattered. The word was,
     <q>
      Tenente Carolo Terras.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     The Mountaine at the approach of the Kings Majestie moved, and the Nymph thus spake unto him.
    </p>
    <p>
     Sir, If nature could suffer Rockes to move, and abandon their naturall places, this Towne founded on the strength of Rockes (now by all cheering rayes of your Majesties presence, taking not onely motion, but life) had with her Castle, Temples, and Houses moved towards you, and besought
     <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000345-004-a"/>
     you to acknowledge her yours, and her indwellers your most humble and affectionate Subjects, and to beleeve how many soules are within her circuits, so many lives are devoted to your sacred Person and Crowne; and here Sir, she offers by me, to the Altar of your glorie, whole Hecatombes of most happy desires, praying all things may prove prosperous unto you, that every vertue and heroicke grace which make a Prince eminent, may with a long and blissed governament attend you; your Kingdomes flourishing abroad with Bayes, at home with Olives. Presenting you Sir, (who art the strong key of this litle world of Great Brittaine) with these keyes, which cast up the gates of her affectioun, and designe you power to open all the springs of the hearts of these her most loyal citizens. Yet this almost not necessary, for as the Rose at the farre appearing of the Morning Starre displayeth and spreadeth her purples, so at the very noyse of your happy returne to this your native country their hearts (if they could have shined without their breasts) were with joy and faire hopes made spatious, nor did they ever in all parts feele a more comfortable heate, then the glorie of your presence at this time darteth upon them.
    </p>
    <p>
     The old forget their age, and looke fresh and young at the sight of so gracious a Prince, the young bear a part in your welcome, desiring many yeares of life, that they may serue you long, all have more joyes then tongues; for as the words of other Nations farre goe beyond and surpasse
     <pb n="5" xml:id="ep000345-004-b"/>
     the affection of their hearts; So in this Nation the affection of their hearts is farre above all they can expresse by words. Daigne then, Sir, from the highest of Majestie, to looke downe on their lownesse, and embrace it, accept the homage of their humble minds, accept their gratefull zeale, and for deeds, accept that great good-will which they have ever carried to the high deserts of your Ancestors, and shall ever to your owne, and your Royall race, Whilst these Rocks shall bee overshadowed with buildings, these buildings inhabited by men, and while men bee endued either with counsell or courage, or enioy any peece of reason, sense, or life.
    </p>
    <p>
     The keyes being delivered in a bason of silver, and his Majestie received by the Majestrates, under a Pale of state, where the streete ascendeth proudest, beginning to turne towards the Gate of the old Towne, hee meeteth with an Arch, the height of which was .... the breadth .... the frontispice of this represented, in Land-skip, a countrey wild, full of Trees, Bushes, Bores, white Kine; along the which appeared one great Mountaine to extend it selfe, with the word upon it,
     <q>
      Grampius.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     In some parts was seene the Sea enriched with Corrall, and the Mussell that conceiveth the
     <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000345-005-a"/>
     pearle; farther off in an Iland appeared a flaming Mountaine with the word,
     <q>
      Tibi serviet vltima Thule.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     On the Chapter was a Lyon rampant, the word
     <q>
      Imperat ipse sibi.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     On the Land-skip was Caledonia in great Letters written, and part represented a number of men in Armes flying and retiring with
     <hi>
      S. P. Q. R.
     </hi>
     on their Ensignes, which shew them to bee Romanes; an other part had a number of naked persons flying and enchayned, with the figures of the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, drawne on their skins, and shapes of flowers, which represented the Picts, under the Romanes, and under-written,
     <q>
      Fracti bello fatisqu&#232; repulsi.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     A Courten falling, the Theater discovered a Lady attired in tissue, her haire was dressed like a Cornucopia, two chaynes, one of gold, another of pearle baudricke wayes, hung downe her shoulders, a Crowne of gold hung from the Arch before her, fhee represented the Genius of Caledonia; neere unto her stood a woman with an Olive-coloured
     <pb n="7" xml:id="ep000345-005-b"/>
     maske, long blacke Locks waving over her backe, her attyre was of divers coloured feathers, which shew her to bee an American, and to represent new Scotland, the Scutcheon in her hand bare the Armes of new Scotland, with this word,
     <q>
      Auspicijs CAROLE magne tuis.
     </q>
    </p>
    <p>
     His Majestie comming neere, was welcomed with these verses by Caledonia.
