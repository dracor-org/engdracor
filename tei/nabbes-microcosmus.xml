Together with my Ladyes my fortune tell, and of her gentleman usher I became her applesquire, to hold the doore, and keepe centinell at taverns. I can play the Bravo where my affronting is upon sure advantage: otherwise I can be kick't with as much patience, as a hungry fidler, when he expects the reversion of a gallants oysters.
