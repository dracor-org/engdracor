        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>GAllants, our Poets have of late sous'd yee, </l>
          <l>In Play and Prologue too, so much abus'd yee. </l>
          <l>That should we beg your aids, I justly fear, </l>
          <l>Y'are so incens'd you'd hardly lend it here. </l>
          <l>But when against a common Foe we arm, </l>
          <l>Each will assist to guard his own concern. </l>
          <l>Women, those charming victors, in whose eyes, </l>
          <l>Lay all their Arts, and their Artilleries; </l>
          <l>Not being contened with the wounds they made, </l>
          <l>Would by new Stratagems our Light invade. </l>
          <l>Beauty alone goes now at too cheap rates; </l>
          <l>And therefore they like Wise and Politick states, </l>
          <l>Court a new power that may the old supply, </l>
          <l>And keep as well as gain the victory. </l>
          <l>They'le joyn the Force of Wit to Beauty now, </l>
          <l>And so maintain the right they have in you; </l>
          <l>If the vain Sex this priviledge should beast, </l>
          <l>Past cure of a declining face we're lost. </l>
          <l>You'le never know the bliss of change, this Art </l>
          <l>Retrieves (when Beauty fades), the wandring heart, </l>
          <l>And though the Airy Spirits move no more, </l>
          <l>Wit still invites as beauty did before. </l>
          <l>To day one of their party ventures out, </l>
          <l>Not with design to Conquer, but to Scout: </l>
          <l>Discourage but this first attempt, and then, </l>
          <l>They'le hardly dare to sally out again. </l>
          <l>The Poetess too, they say, has spyes abroad. </l>
          <l>Which have dispos'd themselves in every read, </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000448-003-a"/>
          <l>I'th' upper Box, Pit, Gallerus, every face </l>
          <l>You find disguis'd, in a black Velvet.— Case. </l>
          <l>My life on 'tis her Spy on purpose sent, </l>
          <l>To hold you n●…a wanton Complement; </l>
          <l>That so you may not censure what she's writ; </l>
          <l>Which done, they le face you down 'twas full of wit. </l>
          <l>Thus, while some common prize you hope to win </l>
          <l>You let the Tyrant Victor enter in </l>
          <l>I beg to day you'd lay that humour by, </l>
          <l>Till you recounter at the Nursery; </l>
          <l>Where they like Centinels from Duty free, </l>
          <l>May meet and wanton with the Enemy. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>How hast thou labour'd to subvert in vain, </l>
          <l>What one poor smile of ours calls-home again; </l>
          <l>Can any see that glorious sight, and say, [Woman pointin to the Ladies. </l>
          <l>A Woman shall'not Victor prove to day: </l>
          <l>Who is't that to their Beauty wou'd submit, </l>
          <l>And yet refuse the Fetters of their Wit. </l>
          <l>He tells you tales of Stratagems and Spyes; </l>
          <l>Can they need Art that have such pow'rful eyes? </l>
          <l>Believe me, Gallants, he'as abus'd you all; </l>
          <l>There's not a Vizard in our whole Cabal: </l>
          <l>Those are but Pickeroons that scour for prey, </l>
          <l>And catch up all they meet with in their way; </l>
          <l>Who can no Captives take, for all they do, </l>
          <l>Is pillage ye, then gladly let you go; </l>
          <l>Ours scorn the petty spoils, and do prefer, </l>
          <l>The Glory, not the Interest of the War: </l>
          <l>But yet our Forces shall obliging prove; </l>
          <l>Imposing nought but constancie in love, </l>
          <l>That's all our Aim, and when we have it too, </l>
          <l>We'll sacrifice it all to pleasure you. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, by a Woman. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>We charg'd you boldly in our first Advance, </l>
          <l>And gave the Onset <hi>A la mode de France</hi>, </l>
          <l>As each had been a 〈◊〉 of Orleance. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Like them our Heat as soon abated too; </l>
          <l>Alas, we could not vanquish with a show, </l>
          <l>Much more then that goes to the conquering you. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>The trial though, will recompence the pain, </l>
          <l>It having wsely taught us how to reign: </l>
          <l>'Tis Beauty only can our Power maintain. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But yet as tributary Kings we own, </l>
          <l>It is by you that we possess that Throne, </l>
          <l>Where had we Victors been, w'●d reign'd alone. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>And we have promis'd what we could not do, </l>
          <l>A fault, methinks, might be forgiven too, </l>
          <l>Since 'tis but what we learne of some of you. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But we are upon equal treatment yet, </l>
          <l>For neither Conquer, since we both submit; </l>
          <l>You, to our Beauty, bow; We to your Wit.. </l>
