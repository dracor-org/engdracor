          <l>AFter twice putting forth to Sea, his Fame </l>
          <l>Shipwrack'd in either, and his once known Name </l>
          <l>In two years silence buried, perhaps lost </l>
          <l>I'the general opinion; at our cost </l>
          <l>(A zealous sacrifice to Neptune made </l>
          <l>For good success in his uncertain trade) </l>
          <l>Our Author weighs up anchors, and once more </l>
          <l>Forsaking the security of the shore, </l>
          <l>Resolves to prove his fortune: What 'twill be, </l>
          <l>Is not in him, or us to prophesie; </l>
          <l>You only can assure us. Yet he pray'd </l>
          <l>This little in his absence might be said, </l>
          <l>Designing me his Orator. He submits </l>
          <l>To the grave censure of those abler Wits </l>
          <l>His weakness; nor dares he profess that when </l>
          <l>The Critiques laugh, he'l laugh at them agen. </l>
          <l>(Strange self-love in a writer!) He would know </l>
          <l>His errors as you find 'em, and bestow </l>
          <l>His future, studies to reform from this </l>
          <l>What in another might be judg'd amiss. </l>
          <l>And yet despair not, Gentlemen; though he fear </l>
          <l>His strengths to please, we hope that you shall hear </l>
          <l>Some things so writ, as you may truly say </l>
          <l>He hath not quite forgot to make a Play, </l>
          <l>As 'tis with malice rumour'd: His intents </l>
          <l>Are fair; and though he want the complements </l>
          <l>Of wide-mouth'd Promisers, who still engage </l>
          <l>(Before their Works are brought upon the Stage) </l>
          <l>Their parasites to proclaim 'em: This last birth </l>
          <l>Deliver'd without noise, may yield such mirth, </l>
          <l>As ballanc'd equally, will cry down the boast </l>
          <l>Of arrogance, and regain his credit lost. </l>

              <l>A thankless Virgin, practise it; and may </l>

          <l>I Am left to enquire, then to relate </l>
          <l>To the still doubtful Author, at what rate </l>
          <l>His marchandise are valued. If they prove </l>
          <l>Staple Commodities in your Grace and love, </l>
          <l>To this last birth of his Minerva, he </l>
          <l>Vows, and we do believe him seriously, </l>
          <l>Sloth cast of, and all pleasures else declin'd, </l>
          <l>He'll search with his best care, until he finde </l>
          <l>New ways, and make good in some labor'd Song, </l>
          <l>Though he grow old, Apollo still is yong. </l>
          <l>Cherish his good intentions, and declare </l>
          <l>By any sign of favor, that you are </l>
          <l>Well pleas'd, and with a general consent, </l>
          <l>And he desires no more encouragement. </l>
