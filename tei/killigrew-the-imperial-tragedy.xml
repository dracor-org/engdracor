     PROLOGUE.

    <l>
     MEthinks I hear some travel'd Gallant say,
    </l>
    <l>
     When he was last at Rome, he saw this Play:
    </l>
    <l>
     That Zeno there was Acted; we confess,
    </l>
    <l>
     And hope, that here he'l have as good success.
    </l>
    <l>
     But we are pester'd with so many Wits,
    </l>
    <l>
     And some, like Madmen, have such judging fits,
    </l>
    <l>
     That this great Tragedy they may condemn,
    </l>
    <l>
     Though, in a humor, they have pardon'd them,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who rob the French and Spanish of their Bayes;
    </l>
    <l>
     And make a fashion of Translating Playes.
    </l>
    <l>
     To own his pattern, th' Author's not asham'd.
    </l>
    <l>
     That Model, which in Italy was fram'd
    </l>
    <l>
     He has new Moulded, for our English Stage;
    </l>
    <l>
     Hoping 'twill fit the temper of this Age:
    </l>
    <l>
     And the learn'd Latin Author not offend,
    </l>
    <l>
     For alt'ring, what he dares not think to mend.
    </l>
    <l>
     Though boldly it be here transformed so,
    </l>
    <l>
     That Author cannot his own Issue know:
    </l>
    <l>
     Like crafty Beggers, when they Children steal,
    </l>
    <l>
     Disguise them; lest they should their Thefts reveal.
