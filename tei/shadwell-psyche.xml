But had I never received any Obligation, by my particular Inclination I am bound to your Grace, since I am the most humble admirer of your Heroick Vertues, who by your early <pb xml:id="ep000733-003-a"/>and unimitable Example, and by your eminent Command, are the greatest Patron of Arms; and by your Government of the most famous of Universities, are become the greatest Protector of Arts: of that University, which I can never mention without reverence; and from which I have yet another Tie to your Grace, since I had once the honour to be a Member of that Illustrious Society, which though it be the most Learned in the World, can boast of no greater Honour then that of being commanded by so Excellent a Prince; one who is equally Valiant against his Enemies, and Courteous to his Friends; whose boundless Courage is always ready to vanquish the one, and whose Princely Generosity is always ready to oblige the other. </p>
        <p>I shall not here recite those Heroick Actions, which all Europe have celebrated, and none have equall'd: Those are too Great for an Epistle Dedicatory, and onely fit for solid, lasting History; which certainly must do your Grace that right, to Enrol you in the foremost Rank of Fame. Nor can we doubt, but the memory of your Grace's Actions will last, when Time shall have devoured the Places where they were performed: When Mastrick shall be a heap of Rubbish, and the name might otherwise be swallow'd in the Ruine, it will be remembred by the greatest Action in the World, done there by the Greatest and the Earliest Hero, and by one, who for all his fierceness of Courage, has yet that Gentleness to Mankind, that he thinks that day lost, in which he does not oblige. One who is not onely infinitely bless'd in the most excellent Partner <pb xml:id="ep000733-003-b"/>of his Joys and Cares, happy above measure in the Goods of Mind, the Perfections of Body, and the greatest Splendour and Ornaments of Fortune, but he enjoys all these unenvied; nay, is not onely free from every mans envy, but has his love. </p>
        <p>I should be afraid of this boldness, in once mentioning things so much above my Pen, were I not assured of your Grace's Generosity, that enclines you to pardon, even a well-intended Errour, in your humble Creature, who begs Protection from you, and needs it too. </p>
        <p>I have, by my misfortune, not my fault, met with some Enemies, who are always ready to do me the irreparable injury, to blast my Reputation with the King; and when I have the Honour to please Him, (which is of all things in the world my greatest Ambition) endeavour to perswade him, that I do not write the Plays I own, or at least, that the best part of them are written for me; which is so malitious an aspersion, that I am sure they themselves believe it not, and they may as well accuse me of firing the City. I am sure (though I may want Wit to write a Play) I have more honesty then to own what another man writes. But I am not yet so poor as to borrow; if I should, I should find not many that are rich enough to lend, Wit being much a scarcer Commodity then Money, I am sure with some who have reported this of me; who what ever they have of of one, have scarce enough of the other to supply their own necessities; and therefore I should be but very slenderly furnished from them. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000733-004-a"/>
        <p>I can never enough acknowledge the Honour done me by your incomparable Durchess, in endeavouring to clear me of this Aspersion: And who would not be proud of being aspersed, to be so vindicated? From this and some other injuries of my Enemies, I humbly beg your Grace's protection, who, I am sure, have Goodness and Greatness enough to defend me against them: And I had rather owe it to your Grace, then to any man: For no man is more then I, </p>

        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>IN a good Natur'd Countrey, I doubt not but this my first Essay in Rhime would be at least forgiven; especially when I promise to offend no more in this kind: But I am sensible, that here I must encounter a great many Difficulties. In the first place (though I expect more candour from the best Writers in Rhime) the more moderate of them (who have yet a numerous party, good Judges being very scarce) are very much offended with me, for leaving my own Province of Comedy, to invade their Dominion of Rhime: But me-thinks they might be satisfi'd, since I have made but a small incursion, and am resolv'd to retire. And were I never so powerful, they should escape me, as the Northern People <pb xml:id="ep000733-005-a"/>did the Romans, their craggy barren Territories being not wo●… the Conqu'ring. The next sort I am to encounter with, are those who are too great Admirers of the French Wit, who (if they a●… not like this Play) will say, the <hi>French Psyche </hi>is much better; if they do, they will say, I have borrow'd it all from the French. Whether the French be better, I leave to the Men of Wit (who understand both Languages) to determine; I will onely say, Here is more Variety, and the Scenes of Passion are wrought up with more Art; and this is much more a Play then that. And I will be bold to affirm that this is as much a Play, as could be made upon this Subject. That I have borrow'd it all from the French, can onely be the objection of those, who do not know that it is a Fable, written by Apulejius, in his <hi>Golden Ass</hi>; where you will find most things in this Play, and the French too. For several things concerning the Decoration of the Play, I am oblig'd to the French, and for the Design of Two of the onely moving Scenes in the French, which I may say, without vanity, are very much improv'd, being wrought up with more Art in this, then in the French Play, without borrowing any of the thoughts from them. </p>
        <p>In a thing written in five weeks, as this was, there must needs be many Errours, which I desire true Criticks to pass by; and which perhaps I see my self, but having much bus'ness, and indulging my self with some pleasure too, I have not had leisure to mend them, nor would it indeed be worth the pains, since there are so many splendid Objects in the Play, and such variety of Diversion, as will not give the Audience leave to mind the Writing; and I <pb xml:id="ep000733-005-b"/>doubt not but the Candid Reader will forgive the faults, when he considers, that the great Design was to entertain the Town with variety of Musick, curious Dancing, splendid Scenes and Machines: And that I do not, nor ever did intend to value my self upon the writing of this Play. For I had rather be Author of one Scene of Comedy, like some of <hi>Ben. Johnsons</hi>, then of all the best Plays of this kind that have been, or ever shall be written: Good Comedy requiring much more Wit and Iudgment in the Writer, then any Rhiming, unnatural Plays can do: This I have so little valu'd, that I have not alter'd six lines in it since it was first written, which (except the Songs at the Marriage of Psyche in the last Scene) was all done Sixteen moneths since. In all the words which are sung, I did not so much take care of the Wit or Fancy of'em, as the making of'em proper for Musick; in which I cannot but have some little knowledge, having been bred for many years of my Youth to some performance in it. </p>
        <p>I chalked out the way to the Composer (in all but the Song of Furies and Devils in the Fifth Act) having design'd which Line I would have sung by One, which by Two, which by Three, which by four Voices, &amp;c. and what manner of Humour I would have in all the Vocal Musick. </p>
        <p>And by his excellent Composition, that long known able and approved Master of Musick, Mr. Lock, (Composer to His Majesty, and Organist to the Queen) has done me a great deal of right; though, I believe, the unskilful in Musick will not like the more solemn part of it, as the Musick in the Temple of Apollo, and the Song of the <hi>Despairing Lovers</hi>, in the Second Act; both which are proper <pb xml:id="ep000733-006-a"/>and admirable in their kinds, and are recommended to the judgment of able Musicians: for those who are not so, there are light and ayery things to please them. </p>
        <p>All the Instrumental Musick (which is not mingled with the Vocal) was composed by that Great Master, Seignior <hi>Gio: Baptista Draghi</hi>, Master of the Italian Musick to the King. The Dances were made by the most famous Master of France, Monsieur St. Andreé. The Scenes were Painted by the Ingenious Artist, Mr. Stephenson. In those things that concern the Ornament or Decoration of the Play, the great industry and care of Mr. Betterton ought to be remember'd, at whose desire I wrote upon this Subject. </p>

        <head>POSTSCRIPT. </head>
        <p>I Had borrow'd something from two Songs of my own, which till this Play was Printed, I did not know were publick; but I have since found 'em printed in Collections of Poems, viz. part of the Song of the <hi>Despairing Lovers</hi>, in the Second Act, and about Eight lines in the First Act, beginning at this line, <hi>'Tis frail as an abortive Birth. </hi>This I say, to clear my self from Thiev'ry, 'tis none to rob my self. The Reader may please to take notice ofseveral Errata's, as, </p>

        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>AS a young Wanton when she first begins, </l>
          <l>With shame and with regret of Conscience sins; </l>
          <l>So fares our trembling Poet, the first time, </l>
          <l>He has committed the lewd sin of Rhime, </l>
          <l>While Custom hardens others in the Crime. </l>
          <l>It might in him that boldness too beget, </l>
          <l>To lay about him without fear or wit: </l>
          <l>But humbly he your pardon does implore; </l>
          <l>Already he repents, and says he'll sin no more. </l>
          <l>His bus'ness now is to shew splendid Scenes, </l>
          <l>T'interpret 'twixt the Audience and Machines. </l>
          <l>You must not here expect exalted Thought, </l>
          <l>Nor lofty Verse, nor Scenes with labour wrought: </l>
          <l>His Subject's humble, and his Verse is so; </l>
          <l>This Theme no thundring Raptures would allow, </l>
          <l>Nor would he, if he could, that way pursue. </l>
          <l>He'd ride unruly Fancy with a Bit, </l>
          <l>And keep within the bounds of Sense and Wit, </l>
          <l>Those bounds no boystrous Fustian will admit. </l>
          <l>And did not gentle Hearers oft dispence </l>
          <l>With all the Sacred Rules of Wit and Sense; </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000733-007-a"/>
          <l>Such tearing Lines, as crack the Writers Brain, </l>
          <l>And the laborious Actors Lungs o'rstrain, </l>
          <l>Wou'd, on our Stages, be roar'd out in vain. </l>
          <l>In all true Wit, a due proportion's found, </l>
          <l>To the just Rules of heighth and distance bound. </l>
          <l>Wit, like a Faulcon, tow'ring in its flight, </l>
          <l>When once it soars above its lawful height, </l>
          <l>Lessens, till it becomes quite out of sight. </l>
          <l>But of such flights, there is no danger now; </l>
          <l>He would not soar too high, nor creep too low: </l>
          <l>Howe'r, he hopes you will excuse his haste, </l>
          <l>For he this gawdy Trifle wrote so fast; </l>
          <l>Five weeks begun and finish'd this design, </l>
          <l>In those few hours he snatch'd from Friends and Wine; </l>
          <l>And since in better things h'has spent his time, </l>
          <l>With which he hopes ere long t'atone this Crime. </l>
          <l>But he, alas! has several pow'rful Foes, </l>
          <l>Who are unjustly so, and yet he knows, </l>
          <l>They will, what e'r he writes, though good, oppose. </l>
          <l>If he the honour has to please the best, </l>
          <l>'Tis not his fault if he offends the rest: </l>
          <l>But none of them yet so severe can be, </l>
          <l>As to condemn this Trifle more then he. </l>
