          <l>Deliver to gain favour, if I could, </l>
          <l>To us, and the still doubtful Author. He, </l>
          <l>When I desir'd an Epilogue, answer'd me, </l>
          <l>'Twas to no purpose: He must stand his fate, </l>
          <l>Since all intreaties now would come too late; </l>
          <l>You being long since resolv'd what you would say </l>
          <l>Of him, or us, as ye rise, or of the Play. </l>
          <l>A strange old Fellow! yet this sullen mood </l>
          <l>Would quickly leave him, might it be understood </l>
          <l>You part not hence displeas'd. I am design'd </l>
          <l>To give him certain notice: If you find </l>
          <l>Things worth your liking, shew it. Hope and Fear, </l>
          <l>Though different passions, have the self-same ear. </l>
