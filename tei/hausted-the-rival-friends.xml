        <head>THE PRAEFACE TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>Ingeneous and vnderstanding Reader, for if thou beest not s, I neither regard thee, nor thy censure. In this age of outsides, wherein to be modest, is to be Ignorant, and to be impudent is call'd Learning wherein to please our walking Things in silke, a man must write dust and cobweb; amongst the rest, though with much difficultie and opposition, yet at the length I haue obtained leaue for this poore neglected Piece of mine to salute the Light, &amp; in spight of all black-mouth'd Calumny (who ha's endeavor'd to crush it into nothing) presented it to the open view. I am not ignorant what base aspersions, &amp; unchristianlike slanders (like a generall infection) haue spread themselues throughout the Kingdome, nor can I hope that the publishing of it can stop all those wide mouthes which are opened against it; yet I must not despaire of so much justice from the Candide, (for their owne honestie is interested in the Action) as (when they shall behold the innocence of it) to confesse, that I suffer most unjustly in these reports. How it was accepted of their Majesties, whom it was intended to please, we know, and had gracious signes: how the rest of the Court were affected, wee know too; Such as were faire and intelligent will yet giue it sufficient Testimonie: As for those which came with starch'd faces and resolutions to dislike whatsoever they saw or heard, (all due reverence being given to the faire fields they weare upon their backes) they must perforce giue mee leaue to be of that haeresie, and thinke that there is something else required to the composition of a Iudgement, then a good Suite of taken-up Clothes, a Countenance set in a frame, and some three shakes of the emptie Noddle. The difficulties, and disadvantages wee went upon were many, and knowne, neither did we faile in the successe we hop'd for; for indeed wee expected no other thing then to be cried downe by many-mouth'd Detraction. Alas, wee are all but men, and may erre; and our offence was the same that was imputed to Cicero, by a great Romane Ladie, who told him that it was Saucinesse in him amongst so many Patricians of eminent blood, to dare to be Vertuous or Eloquent. I doe confesse we did not goe such quaint wayes as we might haue done; we had none of those Sea-artes, knew not how, or else scorn'd to plant our Canvas so advantagiously to catch the wayward <pb xml:id="ep000814-004-a"/>breath of the Spectatours; but freely &amp; ingenuously labourd rather to merit then rauish an Applause from the Theatre. Wee neuer yet were so poorely ambitious (nor euer will) to court the Claps of young Ones, who are more delighted to see an Ape play his forced trickes, then to behold the truest and most naturall Action in the world. Let such as despaire of the approbation of Men, cry, Let in the Boyes, wee shall haue no noyse else. I envie not the applause comes from such hands or tongues. As for the Objections made by Envie and Ignorance, such as I haue heard, I will answere, and then dare all their Snakes to hisse out more. And first, the Lownesse of many of the Persons did displease some; I conversed too much with Sheepheards they say. </p>
        <p>It is the misery of Poetry aboue other sciences, &amp; in Poetry of the Dramme especially, that it lies open to be profan'd by every adulterate judgement. The Musician dares onely judge of Musicke, the Philosopher in naturall causes, the Mathematician of those Arts: But what fly-blowne piece of Man is there, whose best of vertues is to cry God dam him, whose top of knowledge the Alphabeticall and Greeke healths but thinks himselfe a Doctor of the Chaire in what belongs to the Scene? Let them looke into Plautus, and they shall find the chiefest person in his Persa to be a Servant; and it is accounted one of the greatest excellencies in Sydney, that he was able so much to humble his phant'sy, as truly and naturally to set forth the clownery of Dametas, the indigested and unlickt words and phrases of his wife and daughter. But these squirt-wits, (who are able onely to bring forth a paper of verses in a yeare, it may be of a haire that fell from their Mrs. Peruke, and think this sufficient to stile them Laureat) in the Description of a shipwracke (peradventure) would take great delight to see a faire Cypresse tree pictured. All that I will say to them is this, if their mouthes be out of tast, I am not bound to answer for it. But why this before their Majesties? say they. And I say, why not this before their Majesties, rather then higher things? (although they may perceiue that the straine is not continued.) The Court is not acquainted with such groueling humours; Therfore (my obstinate Heretike) the better. To haue showen them nothing but what they see daily, had bin but course entertainment, and if that was my errour, that the two Changelings spoke no strong lines, but plaid at Chackstones, when it may be some of our butterfly-judgements expected a set at Maw or Primivista from them, let it lye upon my Conscience. </p>
        <p>Next, whereas my discretion was call'd in question for making one to raile so bitterly upon Women before the Ladies, whom we should haue labour'd to please rather. I answer, that the Ladies (as some report) should take offence at Anteros his part, will not yet enter me; for although I know many of that sex weak enough, yet me thinks it cannot be that such as they, who are taken out of the Ore, refin'd and wrought up unto such a degree of purity by the Court, that we may not be afraid to say, that they are more then halfe men (that is) come not far short of us in that which gives us our denomination, Reason; it cannot be (I say) that these should so much discredit the opinion which the world has of their apprehensions and judgements, as to be offended to see a Woman-hater personated: for then, how shall we hereafter dare to bring upon the Stage a Bawd, an Vsurer, an Intemperate man, a Traytour, or one that <pb xml:id="ep000814-004-b"/>commits Idolatry to his Mistris, (which is as great a sinne as most of these) if onely to personate be to approue? No, when we act a vice, it is not because we allow of it, but rather labour to extirpe it by shewing the odiousnesse of it to the world. As for that which they object against bringing in of the foure Guls in the third Act, as impertinent to the Plot; I answer, that it was a most naturall passage, &amp; although it conduc'd nothing to the maine hinge on which the chiefe carriage of the Comoedie turn'd, (no more then Liuely's drinking of Sack, the Donation of the Living, with the bestowing of the crooked changeling, Anteros turning sheepheard, or Stypes being tyed to the tree) yet if they please to turne to the latter end of the fift Act, they shall find that they were not all foysted in as meere strangers. Let them shew me (if they can) a rule in Poetry, that binds us so strictly not to meddle with any persons but what appertaine primarily to the plot. If they can (which I cannot beleeue) I will shew them again that Rule broken by most of the prime Writers in this kind, both of Ages past and present, I meane not only in our owne Mother tongue, wherin the Dramme but lately is arriv'd at any perfection, but in Latine, Italian, and others. But this is the bolt of some shallow &amp; narrow capacitie, who peradventure was puzled with the multitude of names, and would haue been better contented with three Actors and a halfe, and some seven or eight papers of verses tyed together with Coblers ends. As for the false and abominable imputations laid upon it by my Tribe with the short haire and long eares, my formall outsides, that looke demure, and snuffle; I doe not much regard them, because it is their Trade; nor are they onely at open defiance with this, but with all kind of learning. Yet I cannot see how any Good man, should be displeased, or thinke Religion any whit wronged, to see those sores and Biles of the Church brought to open view, (the onely way to cure them) to see those (cursed Simoniacall patrons) rowsed from out their dennes, to see such Mopck-schollers, nay Mock-christians expos'd to publique laughter.— A Scrivener, a Box-maker, a Cloth-worker, a Fuller, and such mechanicall sordide people, must with unwash'd hands now adayes dare to offer at Gods Altar, and yet these men must not be touch'd, but Religion (forsooth) suffers in it.— Reade, and blush at thy credulitie.— Reader, not to tire thee with a Preface, thou hast it verbatim, and punctually as it was acted. I confesse, I would willingly haue altred some things which upon more mature deliberation I haue found to be subject to mis-constructions, but that I knew the malice of some would upon that take advantage, to make the world beleeue, that that which hath, or shall be spoken against it, is true.— Reade it with Candour and Discretion, and then call me </p>

          <p>Ha ha he, here be fine feats. (I hope we shall haue a ballad made o'nt before night) ha ha he, the Sun must lay aside all his busines, &amp; be at leasure (forsooth) to fetch back St Valentines day for them, ha ha he. In faith Gentlemen I pity ye, y'ar like to haue a goodly Comoedy here, Plautus his Captiues translated, or some such thing I warrant ye: why your Poet cannot endure a woman; and there are likely to be sweet raptures where the Muse is not amorous and sanguine. But let me see, now I think o'nt, Ile go fetch him out to ye, &amp; ye shall laugh at him most miserably, &amp; the Ladies too; troth do, he deserues it. He has hired me this Valentines morning, (for so ye must suppose it) to lead him out hood-winkt with a black scarf, into the fields, because he would not see a woman. But Gods me! what haue I forgot? I should haue had mine eares stretch'd for it if I had miss'd it. Yee must suppose the Scene too to be here in England at a country village. Some low homely slight stuffe 'twill be, I doubt: pray heavens he does not heare me. And here's an other dainty absurdity too (which I care not much if I tell yee) concerning their cloathes, which as far transcend the condition of the persons, as the court does the country. But that they hope the Court will excuse, for had it not bin here, they had bin forc'd (they say) to keepe the true decorum. But to my charge whom I left at the doore, till I had discover'd whether the coast were cleare. Come sir, now you may venture, you haue a prospect as barren as an Eunuches chin.— O me! why hee's run away. I'le be whipt if he has not smelt out my plot of exposing him to your view.— But heere comes the Prologue, he perhaps brings some newes of him; I'le leaue yee to censure his legs and cringes. </p>
