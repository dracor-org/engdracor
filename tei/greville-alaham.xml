            <l>To tempt the earth, and to prophane the light; </l>
            <l>From mournefull silence, where paine dares not rore </l>
            <l>With libertie; to multiplie it more, </l>
            <l>Nor from the lothsome puddle Acheron, </l>

            <l>Nor from that fowle infernall shaddowed Lampe, </l>
            <l>Which lighteth Sisiphus to rowle his stone: </l>
            <l>These be but bodies plagues, the skirts of hell; </l>
            <l>I come from whence deathes seate doth death excell. </l>
            <l>A place there is vpon no centre placed, </l>
            <l>Deepe vnder depthes, as farre as is the skie </l>

            <l>Mate of Mankinde, in Man vnnaturall; </l>
            <l>Hypocrites, which bodies leaue, and shadowes chose. </l>
            <l>The persons, either Kings by fortune blest, </l>
            <l>Or men by nature made Kings of the rest. </l>

            <l>For suffering more then Kings to Tyrannise, </l>
            <l>Are damn'd; though here to be, yet not to stay: </l>

            <l>My selfe sometimes was such; Ormus my state. </l>
            <l>I bare the name; yet did my Basshas raigne: </l>
            <l>Trusts to few windowes are vnfortunate; </l>

            <l>For by my trusted Basshas was I slaine: </l>
            <l>Now sent to teare downe my posteritie, </l>

          <lg>
            <l>My first charge is, the ruine of mine owne, </l>

            <l>None coming there but spirits ouergrowne, </l>
            <l>And more embodied into wickednesse: </l>
            <l>The bodie by the spirit liuing euer; </l>

                <l>Out of which fatall guide Alaham now vndertakes </l>
                <l>The ruine of his King, and father, for ambitions sake; </l>
                <l>Against the lawes of Nations, power, and natiue blood; </l>
                <l>As if the vttermost of ill a Scepter could make good. </l>
                <l>But marke how Vice still makes example her owne fate; </l>
                <l>For with like mischiefe Hala shakes both him, and his Estate. </l>
                <l>He in his fathers bowels seeks an earthly Throne; </l>
                <l>Whence she supplants his heires againe with bastards of her owne. </l>
                <l>He makes wrong triumph ouer right, and innocence; </l>
                <pb n="22" xml:id="A02226-042-a"/>
                <l>She makes her lust religions lord, confusion her defence. </l>
                <l>Thus, as that Tyrant who cut off the Statues head, </l>
                <l>Which bare the name of Iupiter Olympian christened; </l>
                <l>Euen by this scornfull act to what was God in name, </l>
                <l>Taught people to encroch vpon the sacred Monarch-frame: </l>
                <l>So while the o'reswoll'n pride of this Mahumetan, </l>
                <l>By wounding of his Princely race, playes false with God and man; </l>
                <l>He in it doth disperse those clouds of reuerence, </l>
                <l>Which betweene man, and Monarchs Seate keep sweet intelligence; </l>
                <l>And while he would be lord of order, nature, right, </l>
                <l>Brings in disorder, that deuouring enemy of might, </l>
                <l>Which with her many hands vnweaues what time had wrought, </l>
                <l>And proues, what power obtaines by wrong, is euer dearly bought. </l>
                <l>So that our griefe and ioy is in this Tragedy, </l>
                <l>To see the ill, amongst her owne, act vnprosperity; </l>
                <l>The corne fall to the ground, the chaffe in siues remaine, </l>
                <l>Which of the corne was once, and yet cannot be corne againe. </l>
                <l>But as their ancient mates the sudden-kindled Windes, </l>
                <l>Broken out of the watry clouds, wherein they were enshrin'd; </l>
                <l>Afflict the sturdy Oke, are heauy to the Reed; </l>
                <l>And equally spend out themselues with good or euill speed: </l>
                <l>So of these windy spirits, which wander in the ayre, </l>
                <l>By their malignity to blast, both what is foule, and faire; </l>
                <l>Whether they prosper doe, or faile in their intent, </l>
                <l>Their vglinesse disclosed is, their violence is spent: </l>
                <l>While we vphold the world, and were we all but one, </l>
                <l>By Legions of those Angels curs'd, could not be ouerthrown'd. </l>
                <l>Yet among stories, as the Authors winne no praise, </l>
                <l>Which truly write; but they who time with flatteries doe please: </l>
                <l>So in mans muddy soule, the meane doth not content, </l>
                <l>Nor equally the two extremes; but that which fits his bent. </l>
                <pb n="23" xml:id="A02226-042-b"/>
                <l>This makes some soare, and burne; some stoope, and wet their wings; </l>
                <l>And some againe commit excesse, euen in indifferent things. </l>
                <l>For who maintaines one vice to multiply another, </l>
                <l>Incestuously begets more heyres vpon his owne first mother. </l>
                <l>And in Venerian acts, as Concubine, and wife, </l>
                <l>Only expresse that difference which pictures do from life; </l>
                <l>The act being all in one, and but the same in all, </l>
                <l>Saue that the bondage of the vice delighteth to enthrall: </l>
                <l>So in mans choice, suppose this ends indifferent: </l>
                <l>The good, and ill, like equall wayes; yet will the worst content. </l>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
