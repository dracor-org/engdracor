        <byline>spoken by Mr. Hart. </byline>
        <l>Poets like Cudgel'd Bullys, never do </l>
        <l>At first, or second blow, submit to you; </l>
        <l>But will provoke you still, and ne're have done, </l>
        <l>Till you are weary first, with laying on: </l>
        <l>The late so bafled Scribler of this day, </l>
        <l>Though he stands trembling, bids me boldly say, </l>
        <l>What we, before most Playes are us'd to do, </l>
        <l>For Poets out of fear, first draw on you; </l>
        <l>In a fierce Prologue, the still Pit defie, </l>
        <l>And e're you speak, like Castril, give the lye; </l>
        <l>But though our Bayses Batles oft I've fought, </l>
        <l>And with bruis'd knuckles, their dear Conquests bought; </l>
        <l>Nay, never yet fear'd Odds upon the Stage, </l>
        <l>In Prologue dare not Hector with the Age, </l>
        <l>But wou'd take Quarter from your saving hands, </l>
        <l>Though Bayse within all yielding Countermands, </l>
        <l>Says you Confed'rate Wits no Quarter give, </l>
        <l>Ther'fore his Play shan't ask your leave to live: </l>
        <l>Well, let the vain rash Fop, by buffing so, </l>
        <l>Think to obtain the better terms of you; </l>
        <l>But we the Actors humbly will submit, </l>
        <l>Now, and at any time, to a full Pit; </l>
        <l>Nay, often we anticipate your rage, </l>
        <l>And murder Poets for you, on our Stage: </l>
        <l>We set no Guards upon our Tyring-Room, </l>
        <l>But when with flying Colours, there you come, </l>
        <l>We patiently you see, give up to you, </l>
        <l>Our Poets, Virgins, nay our Matrons too. </l>

        <l>But to your well-drest Brother straight turn round </l>
        <l>And cry, Pox on her Ned, she can't be sound: </l>
        <l>Then slink away, a fresh one to ingage, </l>
        <l>With so much seeming heat and loving Rage, </l>
        <l>You'd frighten listning Actress on the Stage: </l>
        <l>Till she at last has seen you huffing come, </l>
        <l>And talk of keeping in the Tyreing-Room, </l>
        <l>Yet cannot be provok'd to lead her home: </l>
        <l>Next you Fallstaffs of fifty, who beset </l>
        <l>Your Buckram Maidenheads, which your friends get; </l>
        <l>And whilst to them, you of Atchievements boast, </l>
        <l>They share the booty, and laugh at your cost, </l>

        <l>Who wou'd be thought so eager, brisk, and strong, </l>
        <l>Yet do the Ladies, not their Husbands, wrong: </l>
        <l>Whose Purses for your manhood make excuse, </l>
        <l>And keep your Flanders Mares for shew, not use; </l>
        <l>Encourag'd by our Womans Man to day, </l>
        <l>A Horners part may vainly think to Play; </l>
        <l>And may Intreagues so bashfully disown </l>
        <l>That they may doubted be by few or none, </l>
        <l>May kiss the Cards at Picquet, Hombre,— Lu, </l>
        <l>And so be thought to kiss the Lady too; </l>
        <l>But Gallants, have a care faith, what you do. </l>
        <l>The World, which to no man his due will give, </l>
        <l>You by experience know you can deceive, </l>
        <l>And men may still believe you Vigorous, </l>
