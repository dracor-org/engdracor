        <lg>
          <l>SUre there's a Fate in Plays; and 'tis in vain </l>
          <l>To write, while these malignant Planets Reign: </l>
          <l>Some very foolish Influence rules the Pit, </l>
          <l>Not always kind to Sence, or just to Wit. </l>
          <l>And whilst it lasts, let Buffoonry succeed, </l>
          <l>To make us laugh; for never was more need. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000756-003-a"/>
          <l>Farce, in it self, is of a nasty scent; </l>
          <l>But the gain smells not of the Excrement. </l>
          <l>The Spanish Nymph, a Wit and Beauty too, </l>
          <l>With all her Charms bore but a single show: </l>
          <l>But, let a Monster Muscovite appear, </l>
          <l>He draws a crowded Audience round the Year. </l>
          <l>May be thou hast not pleas'd the Box and Pit, </l>
          <l>Yet those who blame thy Tale, commend thy Wit; </l>
          <l>So Terence Plotted; but so Terence Writ. </l>
          <l>Like his thy Thoughts are true, thy Language clean, </l>
          <l>Ev'n Lewdness is made Moral, in thy Scene. </l>
          <l>The Hearers may for want of Nokes repine, </l>
          <l>But rest secure, the Readers will be thine. </l>
          <l>Nor was thy Labour'd Drama, damn'd or hiss'd, </l>
          <l>But with a kind Civility, dismiss'd: </l>
          <l>With such good manners as the <ref target="A60971-e450-b"/>

          <pb xml:id="ep000756-003-b"/>
          <l>There was a glance at parting; such a look </l>
          <l>As bids thee not give o're, for one rebuke. </l>
          <l>But if thou wou'dst be seen, as well as read; </l>
          <l>Copy one living Author, and one dead; </l>
          <l>The Standard of thy Style, let Etherege be: </l>
          <l>For Wit, th' Immortal Spring of Wycherly. </l>
          <l>Learn after both, to draw some just Design, </l>
          <l>And the next Age will learn to Copy thine. </l>

        <byline>Spoken by Mr. Betterton. </byline>
        <lg>
          <l>GAllants, you're welcome to our homely cheer: </l>
          <l>If you have brought your English Stomachs here; </l>
          <l>We'll treat you, as the French say, Cherentine. </l>
          <l>And what we want of Humour, or of Wit, </l>
          <l>Make up with your She-Neighbours in the Pit; </l>
          <l>For on the Stage whate're we do, or say, </l>
          <l>The Vizard Masks can find you better play: </l>
          <l>With all our pains, we can but bring 'em in; </l>
          <l>'Tis you must take the Damsels out agen: </l>
          <l>And when we've brought you kindly thus together, </l>
          <l>'Tis your fault if you're parted by foul weather. </l>
          <l>We hope these natural Reasons may produce, </l>
          <l>In every Whoremaster, a kind excuse </l>
          <l>For all our Faults, the Poet's, and the Players, </l>
          <l>You'l pardon us, if you can find out theirs. <hi>[To the Maskers</hi>. </l>
          <l>But to the gentler Men, who love at sight, </l>
          <l>And never care to come to closer fight, </l>
          <l>We have provided work for them to night. </l>
          <l>With safety they may draw their Cannon down, </l>
          <l>And into a Surrender bomb the Town. </l>
          <l>From both side-boxes play their Batteries; </l>
          <l>And not a Bullet shot, but burning Eyes: </l>
          <l>Those they discharge with such successful Arts, </l>
          <l>They fire, three deep, into the Ladies hearts. </l>
          <l>Since each Man here finds his Diversion, </l>
          <l>Let not the damning of our Play be one. </l>
          <l>But to the Ladies, who must sit it out, </l>
          <l>To hear us prate, and see the Oglers shoot, </l>
          <l>Begging their favour, we have this to say, </l>
          <l>In hopes of their Protection for the Play, </l>
          <l>Here is a Musick meeting every day. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, </head>
        <byline>Spoken by Mrs. Barry. </byline>
        <lg>
          <l>MY Character, not being much in Vogue, </l>
          <l>Has drawn me in to speak the Epilogue: </l>
          <l>But, pray conceive me right, not to disparage </l>
          <l>That ancient, English Perquisite of Marriage; </l>
          <l>Which, when the Priests first made all Pleasure Sin, </l>
          <l>Faster than they could cheat us, drew us in </l>
          <l>With Rites and Liberties of Cuckolding. </l>
          <l>That us'd to be the Custom, and so common, </l>
          <l>No Girl but wish'd her self a Married Woman. </l>
          <l>Whether I've done my Husband right, or no; </l>
          <l>Most Women may be in the right, that do: </l>
          <l>Our Author does not set up for reforming, </l>
          <l>Or giving hints to Fools who won't take warning: </l>
          <l>He's pleas'd, that other People are pleas'd too, </l>
          <l>To help to reap that Harvest which they sow: </l>
          <l>For among all the Cuckolds of this Town, </l>
          <l>Who show themselves, and are as daily shown, </l>
          <l>Our Poets may make some of 'em their own. </l>
          <l>You find in me what may excuse a Wife: </l>
          <l>Compare at home the Picture with the Life, </l>
          <l>And most of you may find a Friendal there; </l>
          <l>And most of you more justly us'd than here: </l>
          <l>Our Author has his ends, if he can show, </l>
          <l>The Women ne'er want cause for what they do: </l>
          <l>For, Ladies, all his aim is pleasing you. </l>
          <l>Some metled Sparks, whom nothing can withstand, </l>
          <l>Your Velvet-Fortune-Hunters, may demand, </l>
          <l>Why, when the means were in the Lady's hand, </l>
          <l>The Husband civil, and the Lover near, </l>
          <l>No more was made of the Wife's Charecter? </l>
          <l>Damn me, cries one, had I been Betterton, </l>
          <l>And struts, and cocks, I know what I had done; </l>
          <l>She should not ha' got clear of me so soon. </l>
          <l>You only fear such Plays may spoil your Game: </l>
          <l>But Flesh and Frailty always are the same: </l>
          <l>And we shall still proceed in our old way, </l>
          <l>For all that you can do, or Poets say. </l>

I have known Mrs. Sightly these seven years— known her! I mean, I have seen her, observed her, followed her: may be there's no knowing a Woman: but in all that time, I never found a freedom, that allowed me any encouragement beyond a friend— May be I have been wanting to my self—. But then she would not throw her self away upon a common Lover; that's not probable: If she had been affectedly reserv'd, I wou'd suspect, the Devil in her heart had stampt the sign of Vertue in her looks, that she might cheat the world, and sin more close. But she is open in her carriage, easie, clear of those arts that have made Lust a Trade— Perhaps that openness may be design— 'Tis easie to raise doubts— And still she may be— I won't think she can— till I know more: But Wittwoud is, I know her, every thing that's mischievous; abandon'd and undone; undone her self, she wou'd undo the Sex: she is to bawd for <hi>Wilding: I </hi>know her bad enough for any trade. But Bawds have some good Nature, and procure pleasure for pay: Wittwoud has baser ends, A general ruine upon all her friends. </p>

I hope you may forgive my knowing it, since by resigning it into your hands, I give you up the only evidence, that can rise up against him: Such a piece of News, Madam, wou'd have been welcome enough to the ill nature of the Town; and I might have had my ends in such a report, had I encourag'd the exposing him: But when I saw how near you <pb n="40" xml:id="ep000756-026-a"/>were concern'd, I had no other pleasure, but the thought of serving you; if I have served you, I am over-paid, if not, I must serve on.

            <p>I find I am restor'd, but I was reduc'd to the necessity of a lye to come into favour again; but that's a Necessity that every man of honour must submit to, sometimes, that has any thing to manage with the women: For a Lover, that never speaks more than the truth, is never believed to be a Lover: and he that won't lye to his Mistress, will hardly lye with her: So let his Honesty reward him; the Lady won't, I dare say for her. There must be a cheat upon the sense sometimes, to make a perfect pleasure to the soul: For if the women did but always know what really we are; we shou'd not so often know so much of them as we doe: But 'tis their own faults; they know we can't live without 'em, and therefore ask more of us than we have honestly to give for the purchase. So, very often, they put us upon dissimulation, slattery and false love, to come up to their price. Mrs. Friendall went away a little abruptly: I'm glad she did: for that methinks confesses an obligation which she has not yet in her power to return. </p>
