That you should authorize it after the Stages tryall was not my intention (for you are none of those that glory to be thought judicious this way, your studies and imployments being more high and serious) but that in your acceptance of it, you would shew your selfe pleased with such acknowledgements as can bee rendered by </p>

        <l>Y'Are welcome Gentlemen to Tot'nam-Court, </l>
        <l>Where You (perhaps) expect some lusty sport; </l>
        <l>Such as rude Custome doth beget in MAY, </l>
        <l>When straggling Numbers court that joviall day </l>
        <l>With early Riot. No such thing must be </l>
        <l>The Subject of our easie COMEDIE. </l>
        <l>What then! a humorous, fiery, red-fac'd Host, </l>
        <l>That will discourse his Guest into more cost </l>
        <l>Then's Cheere is worth: and lyes with so much credit, </l>
        <l>As if 'twere Truths Authoritie, He se'd it, </l>
        <l>Nor this! The AVTHOR surely then intends </l>
        <l>Some Gowne-man of the Towne, that dayly spends </l>
        <l>A thrifty Penny, to preserve his Lungs, </l>
        <l>For a full Voyce 'midst the contentious throngs. </l>
        <l>But heere is no such Satyre: nor is't fit </l>
        <l>Abuse should bee the exercise of Wit. </l>
        <l>To feast your sense and minds for Cakes and Ale, </l>
        <l>New, and not stal'd with handling, heere's a Tale </l>
        <l>Drest up of a faire Milke-maid; whose chast Theame </l>
        <l>Shall close your stomacks up instead of Creame. </l>
        <l>Cook'ry and Wit are like: the selfe same Meat </l>
        <l>Delights one's tast, another cannot eat. </l>
        <l>So 'tis in Fancie's Worke: this loves a jest; </l>
        <l>That Language; Matter pleaseth t'other best. </l>
        <l>Our PLAY''s not larded with great store of these: </l>
        <l>And how the relish of their salt will please </l>
        <l>'Tis doubtfull. Yet We are the lesse affraid; </l>
        <l>Because Your Reck'ning is before-hand paid. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
