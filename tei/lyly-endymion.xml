        <p>MOst high and happy Princesse, we must tell you a tale of the Man in the Moone, which if it seeme ridiculous for the method, or superfluous for the matter, or for the meanes incredible, for three faultes wee can make but one excuse. It is a tale of the Man in the Moone. </p>
        <p>It was forbidden in olde time to dispute of Chymera, because it was a fiction, we hope in our times none will apply pastimes, because they are fancies; for there liueth none vnder the Sunne, that knowes what to make of the Man in the Moone. Wee present neither Comedie, nor Tragedie, nor storie, nor anie thing, 〈◊〉 whosoeuer heareth may say this, Why heere is a tale of the Man in the Moone. </p>

            <p>O fayre Cynthia, why doe others terme thee vnconstant, whom I haue euer founde vnmoueable? Iniurious tyme, corrupt manners, vnkind men, who finding a constancy not to be matched, in my sweete Mistris, haue christned her with the name of wauering, waxing, and waning. Is shee inconstant that keepeth a setled course, which since her first creation altereth not one minute in her mouing? There is nothing thought more admirable, or commendable in the sea, then the ebbing and flowing, and shall the Moone, from whom the Sea taketh this vertue, be accounted fickle for encreasing, &amp; decreasing? Flowers in theyr buds, are nothing worth till they be blowne, nor blossomes accounted till they be ripe fruite, and shal we then say they be changeable, for that they growe from seedes to leaues, from leaues to buds, from buds to theyr perfection? then, why be not twigs that become trees, children that become men, and Mornings that grow to Euenings, termed wauering, for that they continue not at one stay? I but Cynthia, being in her fulnes, decayeth, as not delighting in her greatest beautie, or withering when she should be most honoured. When mallice cannot obiect any thing, folly will, making that a vice, which is the greatest vertue. What thing (my Mistris excepted) being in the pride of her beauty, &amp; latter minute of her age, that waxeth young againe? Tell mee Eumenides, what is hee that hauing a Mistris of ripe yeeres, &amp; infinite vertues, great honors, and vnspeakeable beauty, but woulde wish that shee might grow tender againe? getting youth by yeeres, and neuer decaying beauty, by time, whose fayre face, neyther <pb xml:id="ep000138-004-b"/>the Summers blase can scorch, nor Winters blast chappe, nor the numbring of yeeres breede altering of colours. Such is my sweete Cynthia, whom tyme cannot touch, because she is diuine, nor will offend because she is delicate. O Cynthia, if thou shouldest alwaies continue at thy fulnes, both Gods and men woulde conspire to rauish thee. But thou to abate the pride of our affections, dost detract from thy perfections, thinking it sufficient, if once in a month we enioy a glymse of thy maiestie, and then, to encrease our greefes, thou doost decrease thy glemes, comming out of thy royall robes, wherewith thou dazelist our eyes, downe into thy swath clowtes, beguiling our eyes. And then </p>

What reuenge may be deuised so full of shame, as my thoughts are replenished with mallice? Tell me Floscula if falsenes in loue can possibly be punished with extremitie of hate. As long as sworde, fire, or poison may be hyred, no traytor to my loue shall liue vnreuenged. Were thy oathes without number, thy kisses without measure, thy sighes without end, forged to deceiue a poore credulous virgin, whose simplicity had beene worth thy fauour and better fortune? If the Gods sitte vnequall beholders of iniuries, or laughers at Louers deceipts, then let mischiefe be as well forgiuen in women, as periurie winked at in men. </p>

            <p>O Fayre Cynthia, ô vnfortunate Endimion. Why was not thy byrth as high as thy thoughts, or her beautie lesse then heauenlie? or why are not thyne honors as rare as her beautie? or thy fortunes as great as thy deserts? Sweet Cynthia, how wouldst thou be pleased, how possessed? wil labours (patient of all extremities) obtaine thy loue? There is no Mountain so steepe that I will not climbe, no monster so cruell that I will not tame, no action so desperate that I will not attempt. Desirest thou the passions of loue, the sad and melancholie moodes of perplexed mindes, the not to be expressed torments of racked thoughts? Beholde my sad teares, my deepe sighes, my hollowe eyes, my broken sleepes, my heauie countenaunce. Wouldst thou haue mee vowde onelie to thy beautie and consume euerie minute of time in thy seruice, remember my solitarie life, almost these seauen yeeres, whom haue I entertained but mine owne thoughts, and thy vertues? What companie haue I vsed but contemplation? Whom haue I wondred at but thee? Nay whom haue I not contemned, <pb xml:id="ep000138-009-b"/>for thee? Haue I not crept to those on whom I might haue troden, onelie because thou didst shine vpon them? Haue not iniuries beene sweet to mee, if thou vouchsafest I should beare them? Haue I not spent my golden yeeres in hopes, waxing old with wishing, yet wishing nothing but thy loue. With Tellus, faire Tellus, haue I dissembled, vsing her but as a cloake for mine affections, that others seeing my mangled and disordered minde, might thinke it were for one that loueth me, not for Cynthia, whose perfection alloweth no companion, nor comparison. </p>
            <p>In the midst of these distempred thoughts of myne, thou art not onelie iealous of my truth, but careles, suspicious, and secure: which strange humor maketh my minde as desperate as thy conceits are doubtfull. I am none of those Wolues that barke most, when thou shynest brightest. But that fish, (thy fish Cynthia in the floode Aranis) which at thy waxing is as white as the driuen snowe, and at thy wayning, as blacke as deepest darknes. I am that Endimion (sweet Cynthia) that haue carryed my thoughts in equall ballance with my actions, being alwaies as free from imagining ill, as enterprysing; That Endimion, whose eyes neuer esteemed anie thing faire, but thy face, whose tongue termed nothing rare but thy vertues, and whose hart imagined nothing miraculous, but thy gouernment. Yea that Endimion, who diuorsing himselfe from the amiablenes of all Ladies, the brauerie of all Courts, the companie of al men, hath chosen in a solitarie Cell to liue, onely by feeding on thy fauour, accounting in the worlde (but thy selfe) nothing excellent, nothing immortall; thus maist thou see euerie vaine sinew, muscle, and artery of my loue, in which there is no flatterie, nor deceipt; error, nor arte. But soft, here commeth Tellus, I must turne my other face to her like Ianus, least she be as suspicious as Juno. </p>

            <p>Aske? so I will: and what shall I doo but aske, and whome should I aske but Semele, the possessing of whose person, is a pleasure that cannot come within the compasse of comparison, whose golden lockes seeme most curious, when they seeme most carelesse, whose sweete lookes seeme most alluring, when they are most chaste: and whose wordes the more vertuous they are, <pb xml:id="ep000138-020-a"/>the more amorous they bee accounted. I pray thee fortune when I shall first meete with fayre Semele, dash my delight with some light disgrace, least imbracing sweetnesse beyond measure, I take a surfit without recure: let her practise her accustomed coynesse, that I may dyet my selfe vpon my desires: otherwise the fulnesse of my ioyes will diminish the sweetnesse, and I shall perrish by them before I possesse them. </p>
            <p>Why doe I trifle the time in words? The least minute beeing spent in the getting of Semele, is more worth then the whole worlde: therefore let mee aske. What nowe Eumenides? Whether art thou drawn? Hast thou forgotten both friendship and duetie? Care of Endimion, and the commaundement of Cynthia? Shall hee dye in a leaden sleepe, because thou sleepest in a golden dreame? I, let him sleepe euer, so I slumber but one minute with Semele. Loue knoweth neither friendshippe nor kindred. </p>
            <p>Shall I not hazard the losse of a friend, for the obtayning of her for whome I woulde often loose my selfe? Fonde Eumenides, shall the intycing beautie of a most disdainfull Ladie, bee of more force then the rare fidelitie of a tryed friend? The loue of men to women is a thing common, and of course: the friendshippe of man to man infinite, and immortall. Tush, Semele dooth possesse my loue. I but Endimion hath deserued it. I will helpe Endimion. I founde Endimion vnspotted in his trueth. I but I shall finde Semele constant in her loue. I will haue Semele. What shall I doe? Father thy gray haires are Embassadours of experience. Which shall I aske? </p>

            <p>Eumenides, release Endimion, for all thinges (friendship excepted) are subiect to fortune: Loue is but an eye worme, which onely tickleth the heade with hopes, and wishes: friendshippe the image of eternitie, <pb xml:id="ep000138-020-b"/>in which there is nothing moueable, nothing mischeeuous. As much difference as there is betweene Beautie and Vertue, bodies and shadowes, colours and life: so great oddes is there betweene loue and friendshippe. </p>
            <p>Loue is a Camelion, which draweth nothing into the mouth but ayre, and nourisheth nothing in the bodie but lunges: beleeue mee Eumenides, Desire dyes in the same moment that Beautie sickens, and Beautie fadeth in the same instant that it flourisheth. When aduersities flowe, then loue ebbes: but friendship standeth stifflie in stormes. Time draweth wrinckles in a fayre face, but addeth fresh colours to a fast friende, which neither heate, nor cold, nor miserie, nor place, nor destiny, can alter or diminish. O friendship of all things the most rare, and therefore most rare because most excellent, whose comforts in misery is alwaies sweet, and whose counsels in prosperitie are euer fortunate. Vaine loue, that onely comming neere to friendship in name, woulde seeme to be the same, or better, in nature. </p>

But what respectest thou the loue of all the world, Endimion hates thee. Alas poore Endimion, my malyce hath exceeded my loue: and thy faith to Cynthia, quenched my affections. Quenched Tellus? nay kindled them a fresh; in so much that I finde scorching flames, for dead embers, and cruell encounters of warre in my thoughtes, in steede of sweete parlees. Ah that I might once againe see Endimion, accursed <pb xml:id="ep000138-022-a"/>girle, what hope hast thou to see Endimion? on whose head already are growne gray haires, and whose life must yeelde to Nature, before Cynthia ende her displeasure. Wicked Dipsas, and most deuilish Tellus, the one for cunning too exquisit, the other for hate too intollerable. Thou wast commanded to weaue the stories &amp; Poetries, wherin were shewed both examples &amp; punishments of tatling tongues, and thou hast only imbrodered the sweet face of Endimion, deuises of loue, melancholy imaginations, and what not, out of thy worke, that thou shouldst studie to picke out of thy mind. But here cometh Corsites, I must seeme yeelding and stoute, ful of mildnesse, yet tempered with a Maiestie: for if I be too flexible, I shall giue him more hope then I meane, if too froward, enioy lesse liberty then I would, loue him I cannot, &amp; therfore will practise that which is most contrarie to our sex, to dissemble. </p>

But tell me Tellus, what was the cause of this cruel part, farre vnfitting thy sexe, in which nothing should be but simplenes: and much disagreeing from thy face, in which nothing seemed to bee but softnes. </p>

        <p>A Man walking abroade, the wind and Sunne stroue for soueraignty, the one with his blast, the other with his beames. The wind blew hard, the man wrapped his garment about him harder: it blustred more strongly, he then girt it fast to him: I cannot preuaile sayd the wind. The Sunne casting her Christall beames, began to warme the man: he vnlosed his gowne. yet it shined brighter: he then put it off. I yeelde sayd the winde, for if thou continue shining, he will also put off his cote. </p>
        <p>Dread Soueraigne, the malicious that seeke to ouerthrowe vs with threats, do but stiffen our thoughts, and make them sturdier in stormes: but if your Highnes vouch safe with your fauorable beames to glaunce vpon vs, we shall not onlie stoope, but with all humilitie, lay both our handes and hearts, at your Maiesties feete. </p>
