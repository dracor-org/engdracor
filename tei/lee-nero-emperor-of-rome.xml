     POets for the most part in their Dedications miss of their design, which should be to please that Honourable Person, whose protection they desire. For what pleasure can a Noble Spirit (whose Ingenuity equals its height) receive an exorbitant Praise and ill tim'd Applause? Not that the severest Cynick should snarl at just Commendations and due Encomiums;
     <pb xml:id="ep000627-003-a"/>
     such was the Epistle of Horace to
     <hi>
      Augustus Plinie's
     </hi>
     Panegyrick to Trajan, which sort of ponder'd Eloquence ought to be as Grateful to a brave and elevated Mind as Adorations to the Deity. My Business waving Insinuation is to pray, not to praise; and I hope I shall appear less troublesome to your Lordship under the form of a Begger, than that of a Flatterer. Your protection &amp; favour is implor'd by this Humble Supplicant in the behalf of a Civil Tyrant, at least one whom I have so represented, and for which I have been sufficiently censur'd perhaps unjustly enough; since 'tis not impossible for a man to love and hate, to be brave and bad. From the Criticks, whose fury I dread those Killmen and more then Jews; I appeal to your Lordship as the Saint did to Caesar. To you whose Iudgment vies remark with your Grandeiur, who are as absolutely Lord
     <pb xml:id="ep000627-003-b"/>
     of Wit as those prevaricators are its slaves. To you who by excellent Reading and Conversation with the pleasantly wise, have justly limited the mighty Sallies of an overflowing Fancy. whose sayings astonish the Censorious, and whose Writings are so exactly ingenious; Princes treasure them in their Memory, as things Divine. This is so far from flattery or untruth, that it appears rather an impertinent kind of asserting what every Man knows, as if I should gravely tell the World 'tis day at noon; which I had rather another should be smil'd at for, than he who is in highest Truth and lowest Humility.

     The Prologue, Spoken by Mr. Haines.
    </head>
    <l>
     GOOD Playes, and perfect Sense as scarce are grown,
    </l>
    <l>
     As civil Women in this damn'd lewd Town.
    </l>
    <l>
     Plain Sense, is despicable as plain Cloaths,
    </l>
    <l>
     As English Hatts, Bone-lace, or woollen Hose;
    </l>
    <l>
     'Tis your brisk fool that is your Men of Note;
    </l>
    <l>
     Yonder he goes, in the the embroider'd Cote;
    </l>
    <l>
     Such wenching eyes, and hands so prone to ruffle;
    </l>
    <l>
     The gentile fling, the Trip and modish shuffle;
    </l>
    <l>
     Salt soul and flame, as gay as any Prince
    </l>
    <l>
     Thus Taggs and Silks, make up your Men of Sense.
    </l>
    <l>
     I'm told that some are present here to day,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who e're they see, resolve to Dam this Play,
    </l>
    <l>
     So much wou'd interest with ill nature Sway;
    </l>
    <l>
     But Ladies, you we hope, will prove more civil,
    </l>
    <l>
     And charm these witts that Dam beyond the Devil:
    </l>
    <l>
     Then let each Crittick here, all Hell-inherit,
    </l>
    <l>
     You have attractions that can lay a Spirit.
    </l>
    <l>
     A bloody fatal Play you'l see to night,
    </l>
    <l>
     I vow to Gad, 'thas put me in a fright.
    </l>
    <l>
     The meanest waiter huffs, looks Big, and struts,
    </l>
    <l>
     Gives brest a blow, then hand on hilt he puts;
    </l>
    <l>
     'Tis a fine Age, a tearing Thund'ring age,
    </l>
    <l>
     Pray Heav'n, this Thund'ring does not erack the Stage:
    </l>
    <l>
     This Play I like not now&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     And yet for ought I know, it may be good,
    </l>
    <l>
     But still I hate this fighting wounds, and blood,
    </l>
    <l>
     Why, what the devil have I to do with honour,
    </l>
    <l>
     Let Heroes Court her, I cry, Pox upon her;
    </l>
    <l>
     All Tragedies i'Gad to me sound odly,
    </l>
    <l>
     I can no more be serious, than you Godly.

       With faithful truth, Sir, I have serv'd you long:
      </l>
      <l>
       Yours was the right, I did my self the wrong;
      </l>
      <l>
       But now it matters not, 'twas Loyalty,
      </l>
      <l>
       And, as I liv'd, I in your service dye.
      </l>
      <l>
       My counsel is, you by your own hand bleed;
      </l>
      <l>
       The Senate has some base poor death decreed.
      </l>
      <l>
       Death's but a name; by my example fall:
      </l>
      <l>
       I fear no lakes, nor stigian Frogs; that's all.

       The Gods when we're awake their Daemons keep

       At home, and only fright us when we sleep.

    <l>
     HOW dull, how grave, and how precise ye sit,
    </l>
    <l>
     As if ye had acted Love, not tasted wit.
    </l>
    <l>
     When the Trick's done, like Wine unstop'd yee pall
    </l>
    <l>
     After enjoyment, thus it's with yee all,
    </l>
    <l>
     Your modish Playes like jaunty Misses shew'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     Be bravely drest, high flown, more fine than good
    </l>
    <l>
     For Cloaths attract yee more than flesh and blood.
    </l>
    <l>
     Like cover'd viands Beauties hid from sight,
    </l>
    <l>
     Raise drooping fancy up to new delight.
    </l>
    <l>
     For you Gallants, ye gay brisk witty Men,
    </l>
    <l>
     He knows your killing trade, your damning strain;
    </l>
    <l>
     Ye can as well Wenches and drink restrain:
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet faith for my sweet sake be kind to night,
    </l>
    <l>
     Or may this heavy curse upon ye light;
    </l>
    <l>
     May each Gallant that has an assignation,
    </l>
    <l>
     Be jilted after four hours expectation;
    </l>
    <l>
     Or if the masked Gentlewoman come
    </l>
    <l>
     Spight of long Scarff, may she be dogg'd from home.
    </l>
    <l>
     May ye&#8212;
    </l>
    <l>
     In height of Titilation hear a rapping,
    </l>
    <l>
     And then the jealous Cuckold take ye napping.
