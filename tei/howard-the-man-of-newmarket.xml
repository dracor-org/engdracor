          <p>What else, man? allowing this difference, that the Sub-poet whensoever he writes, he must refer his Papers (with some torment) to their inquisition. After which perhaps, to spite a better Muse, they may give his the applause of a favour'd bad one. </p>

        <head>THE PROLOGUE, Spoke by Mr. CLARKE. </head>
        <l>A Bold Induction, and, to tell you true, </l>
        <l>'Twas fitted purposely for some of you. </l>
        <l>And pity 'tis no medium men can finde, </l>
        <l>In being here perpetually unkinde. </l>
        <l>And thus with Wits and Poets runs the strife, </l>
        <l>'Tis thought may last at least this Ages life. </l>
        <l>Or like the long disputes 'twixt France and Spain, </l>
        <l>Besides their Allies, and the wrong'd Lorain: </l>
        <l>Not all know which with better sence contest, </l>
        <l>Though most the weaker side allow the best. </l>
        <l>And thus they sometimes rail, and sometimes fight, </l>
        <l>Until a juster Power compose their might. </l>
        <l>Such a Confederate we wish for here; </l>
        <l>And though from Nimmegen there none appear, </l>
        <l>Yet something to comply you is design'd, </l>
        <l>A Jest you'll say indeed to make you kind. </l>
        <l>But 'tis no matter— or yet stay a while, </l>
        <l>We may have those, to spite your Wit, can smile. </l>
        <l>Perhaps, intreated from Newmarket too, </l>
        <l>To Sham you here, as there they others do. </l>

        <l>I bring the Epilogue along with me. </l>
        <l>And I have been, as I presume you'll say, </l>
        <l>As merry as most Ladies in a Play; </l>
        <l>And'tis loves Mirth best suits the Comick way. </l>
        <l>Nor doubt I, Ladies, but 'tis known to you, </l>
        <l>That some Newmarket-lads are Lovers too. </l>
        <l>Men that quick pleasures swiftly can imploy, </l>
        <l>Most Women graut their speed, their love enjoy. </l>
        <l>Wit they pretend to, as you Gallants do, </l>
        <l>Who, though call'd Wits, like them lose money too. </l>
        <l>Yet know in Matches no such booty way's, </l>
        <l>As they who here cry up or damn our Play's. </l>
        <l>Then Criticks have a care what you commit, </l>
        <l>Lest here our Jockeys with you wager Wit. </l>
        <l>They know your stingy slights, and how inclin'd, </l>
        <l>And what to Crony Poets is design'd; </l>
        <l>Whilst this our Author does by me afford </l>
        <l>Not so much for his Play as one kinde word. </l>
        <l>Or tells you that his Scenes or Wit are new, </l>
        <l>Which some, that boast much wit, want wit to shew. </l>
        <l>We for a Play such Wits did all approve, </l>
        <l>Got little Money, we playd all for Love. </l>
