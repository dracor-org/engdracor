          <l>Pardon me M. Arthur, I will now </l>

          <l>Your modest wife with words I tempted oft, </l>

          <l>Nor any good I could forge for my selfe </l>
          <l>Would winne her to attend to my request: </l>
          <l>Nay after death I lou'd her, in so much </l>
          <l>That to the vault where she was buried, </l>
          <l>My constant loue did lead me thorow the darke, </l>
          <l>There readie to haue tane my last farewell, </l>
          <l>The parting kisse I gaue her I felt warme, </l>
          <l>Briefly, I bare her to my mothers house, </l>
          <l>Where she hath since liu'd the most chast &amp; true, </l>
          <l>That since the worlds creation eye did view. </l>
