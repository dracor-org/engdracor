        <head>To Master WILLIAM PRINNE, Vtter-Barrester of Lincolnes-Jnne. </head>
        <p>SIR, </p>
        <p>THe fame of your Candor and Innocent Love to Learning, especially to that Musicall part of humane knowledge Poetry, and in particular to that which concernes the Stage and Scene (your selfe as I heare, having lately written a Tragedie) doth iustly chalenge from me this Dedication. I had an early desire to congratulate your happy Retirement, but no Poeme could tempt mee with so faire a circumstance as this in the Title, wherein I take some delight to thinke (not without imitation of your selfe) who have ingeniously fancied such Elegant and apposite names, for your owne Compositions, as Health's Sicknesse, The Vnlovelinesse of Love-lockes, &amp;c.) how aptly I may present you at this time, with The Bird in a Cage. A Comedy, which wanteth I must confesse, much of that Ornament, which the Stage and Action lent it, for it comprehending also another Play or Interlude, personated by Ladies, I must referre to your imagination, The Musicke, the Songs, the Dancing, and other varieties, which I know would have pleas'd you infinitely in the Presentment. I was the rather inclined to make this Oblation, that Posterity might read you a Patron to the Muses, and one that durst in such a Criticall Age, bind vp the Wounds which Ignorance had printed vpon wit and the Professors: Proceed (Inimitable Mecenas) <pb xml:id="ep000263-003-a"/>and having such convenient leysure, and an Pegasus, I meane your Prose (which scorneth the Roade of Common sence, and despiseth any Stile in his way) travell still in the pursuit of new discoveries, which you may publish if you please, in your next Booke of Digressions. If you doe not happen presently to convert the Organs, you may in time confuse the Steeple, and bring every Parish to one Bell.— </p>
        <p>This is all I have to say at this time, and my owne Occasions not permitting my personall attendance, I have intreated a Gentleman to deliver this Testimonie of my Seruice, many faults have escaped the Presse, which your Iudgment will no sooner find, then your Mercie correct, by which you shall teach others a Charity to your owne Volumes, though they be all Errata. If you continue where you are, you will every day inlarge your fame, and beside the engagement of other Poets to Celebrate your Roman Constancie, in particular obliege the Tongue and Penne of your Devout Honourer,— </p>
        <p>IAMES SHIRLEY. </p>
