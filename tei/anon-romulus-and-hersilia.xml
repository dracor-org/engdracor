        <l>But Sirs, 'Faith here is <hi>News from Rome </hi>to day; </l>
        <l>Yet know withal, we've no such Packets here, </l>
        <l>As you read once a Week from Monkey Care. </l>
        <l>But 'stead of that Lewd Stuff (that clogs the Nation) </l>
        <l>Plain Love and Honour; (tho quite out of fashion; </l>
        <l>Ours is a Virgin Rome, long, long, before </l>
        <l>Pious Geneva Rhetorick call'd her Whore; </l>
        <l>For be it known to their Eternal Shames, </l>
        <l>Those Saints were always good at calling Names: </l>
        <l>Of <hi>Scarlet Whores </hi>let 'em their Wills devise, </l>
        <l>But let 'em raise no other <hi>Scarlet lies</hi>; </l>
        <l>Lies that advance the <hi>Good Old Cause</hi>, and bring </l>
        <l>Into Contempt the Prelate with the KING. </l>
        <l>Of what will such vile Brutes be now affraid, </l>
        <l>When Rats and Weazles gnaw the Lyon's Beard? </l>
        <l>And then in <hi>Ignoramus Holes </hi>they think, </l>
        <l>Like other Vermin, to lie close, and stink. </l>
        <l>What have ye got, ye <hi>Conscientious Knaves</hi>, </l>
        <l>With all your <hi>Fancy'd Power</hi>, and <hi>Bully Braves</hi>? </l>
        <l>With all your <hi>standing to't</hi>; your <hi>Zealous Furies</hi>; </l>
        <l>Your <hi>Lawless Tongues</hi>, and <hi>Arbitrary Juries</hi>? </l>
        <l>Your <hi>Burlesque Oaths</hi>, when one Green-Ribbon-Brother, </l>
        <l>In Conscience will be Perjur'd for another? </l>
        <l>Your Plots, Cabals; Your <hi>Threats, Association</hi>, </l>
        <l>Ye shame, Ye very Nusance of the Nation, </l>
        <l>What have ye got but one poor Word? Such Tools </l>
        <l>Were Knaves before; to which you've added Fools. </l>
        <l>Now I dare swear, some of you Whigsters say, </l>
        <l>Come on, now for a swinging <hi>Tory Play. </hi>
        </l>
        <l>But, Noble Whigs, pray let not those Fears start ye, </l>
        <l>Nor fright hence any of the <hi>Sham Sheriffs Party</hi>; </l>
        <l>For, if you'l take my censure of the story, </l>
        <l>It is as harmless as e're came before ye, </l>
        <l>And writ before the times of Whig and Tory. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE Writ By Mrs. A. Behn. </head>
        <byline>Spoken by Tarpeia. </byline>
        <l>FAir Ladies, pitty an unhappy Maid, </l>
        <l>By Fortune, and by faithless Love betray'd. </l>
        <l>Innocent once— I scarce knew how to sin, </l>
        <l>Till that unlucky Devil entring in, </l>
        <l>Did all my Honour, all my Faith undo: </l>
        <l>Love! like Ambition, makes us Rebels too: </l>
        <l>And of all Treasons, mine was most accurst; </l>
        <l>Rebelling 'gainst a King and Father first. </l>
        <l>A Sin, which Heav'n nor Man can e're forgive; </l>
        <l>Nor could I Act it with the face to live. </l>
        <l>My Dagger did my Honours cause redress; </l>
        <l>But oh! my blushing Ghost must needs confess, </l>
        <l>Had my young Charming Lover faithful been, </l>
        <l>I fear I'd dy'd with unrepented Sin. </l>
        <l>There's nothing can my Reputation save </l>
        <l>With all the True, the Loyal and the Brave; </l>
        <l>Not my Remorse, or Death, can expiate </l>
        <l>With them a Treason 'gainst the KING and State. </l>
        <l>Some Love-sick Maid perhaps, now I am gone, </l>
        <l>(Raging with Love, and by that Love undone;) </l>
        <l>May form some little Argument for me, </l>
        <l>
          <hi>T' excuse m' </hi>Ingratitude and Treachery. </l>
        <l>
          <hi>Some of the Sparks too, that infect the </hi>Pit, </l>
        <l>(Whose Honesty is equal to their Wit, </l>
        <l>And think Rebellion but a petty Crime, </l>
        <l>Can turn to all sides Int'rest does incline,) </l>
        <l>
          <hi>May cry</hi>" I gad I think the Wench is wise; </l>
        <l>" Had it prov'd Lucky, twas, the way to rise. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000763-035-a"/>
        <l>" She had a Roman Spirit, that disdains </l>
        <l>" Dull Loyalty, and the yoke of Sovereigns. </l>
        <l>" A Pox of Fathers, and Reproach to come; </l>
        <l>" She was the first and Noblest Whig of Rome. </l>
        <l>But may that Ghost in quiet never rest, </l>
        <l>Who thinks it self with Traytors Praises blest. </l>
