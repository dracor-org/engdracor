        <head>To The Reader. </head>
        <p>IF you be not reasonably assurde of your knowledge in this kinde of Poeme, lay downe the booke or read this, which I would wish had bene the prologue. It is a pastorall Tragic-comedie, which the people seeing when it was plaid, hauing euer had a singuler guise in defining, concluded to be a play of country hired Shepheards, in gray cloakes, with curtaild dogs in strings, sometimes laughing together, and sometimes killing one another: And missing whitsun ales, creame, wassel &amp; morris-dances, began to be angry. In their error I would not haue you fall, least you incurre their censure. Vnderstand therefore a pastorall to be a representation of shepheards and shepheardesses, with their actions and passions, which must be such as may agree with their natures at least not exceeding former fictions, &amp; vulgar traditions: they are not to be adorn'd with any art, but such improper ones as nothing is said to bestow, as singing and Poetry, or such as experience may teach them, as the vertues of hearts, &amp; fountaine the ordinary course of the Sun, moone, and starres, and such like. But you are euer to remember Shepherds to be such, as all the ancient Poets and moderne of vnderstanding haue receaued them: that is, the owners of flockes and not hyerlings A tragic-comedie is not so called in respect of mirth and killing ● but in respect it wants deaths, which is inough to make it no tragedie, yet brings some neere it, which is inough to make it no comedie: which must be a representation of familiar people, with such kinde of trouble as no life be questiond, so that a God is as lawfull in this as in a tragedie, and meane people as in a comedie. Thus much I hope will serue to iustifie my Poeme, and make you vnderstand it, to teach you more for nothing, I do not know that I am in conscience bound. </p>

          <l>Ere he be slak'd: no more can he whose minde </l>
          <l>Ioies in the muses, hold from that delight, </l>
          <l>When nature, and his full thoughts bad him write, </l>
          <l>Yet wish I those whome I for friends haue knowne, </l>
          <l>To sing their thoughts to no eares but their owne: </l>
          <l>Why should the man, whose wit nere had a staine, </l>
          <l>Vpon the publike stage present his vaine, </l>
          <l>And make a thousand men in iudgement sit, </l>
          <l>To call in question his vndoubted wit, </l>
          <l>Scarce two of which can vnderstand the lawes </l>
          <l>Which they should iudge by, nor the parties cause, </l>
          <l>Among the rout there is not one that hath </l>
          <l>In his owne censure an explicite faith. </l>
          <l>One company knowing they iudgement lacke, </l>
          <l>Ground their beliefe on the next man in blacke: </l>
          <l>Others, on him that makes signes, and is mute, </l>
          <l>Some like as he does in the fairest sute, </l>
          <l>He as his mistres doth, and she boy chance, </l>
          <l>Nor wants there those, who as the body doth dance </l>
          <l>Betweene the actes, will censure the whole play: </l>
          <l>Some like if the wax lights be new that day: </l>
          <l>But multitudes there are whose iudgements goes </l>
          <l>Headlong according to the actors clothes. </l>
          <l>For this, these publicke things and I, agree </l>
          <l>So ill, that but to do aright to thee, </l>
          <l>I had not bene perswaded to haue hurld </l>
          <l>These few, ill spoken lines, into the world, </l>
          <l>Both to be read, and censurd of, by those, </l>
          <l>Whose very reading makes verse senceles prose, </l>
          <l>Such as must spend aboue an houre, to spell </l>
          <l>A challenge on a post, to know it well, </l>
          <l>But since it was thy happe to throw away, </l>
          <l>Much wit, for which the people did not pay, </l>
          <l>Because they saw it not, I not dislike </l>
          <l>This second publication, which may strike </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
