     TO HER GRACE THE Dutchess OF CLEAVLAND.
    </head>
    <opener>
     <salute>
      MADAM,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     ALL Authors whatever in their Dedications are Poets; but I am now to Write to a Lady, who stands as little in need of Flattery, as her Beauty of Art; otherwise, I shou'd prove as ill a Poet to her in my Dedication, as to my Reader in my Play: I can do your Grace no Honour, nor make you more admirers then you have already; yet I can do my self the honour to let the world know, I am the greatest you have; you will pardon me, Madam, for you know, 'tis very hard for a new Author, and Poet too, to govern his Ambition; for Poets, let them pass in the world never so much, for modest, honest men, but begin praise to others, which concludes in themselves; and are like Rooks, who lend people money, but to win it back again, and so leave them in debt to 'em for nothing; they offer Laurel and Incense to their Hero's, but wear it themselves, and perfume themselves. This is true, Madam, upon the honest word of an Author,
     <pb xml:id="ep000790-003-a"/>
     who never yet writ Dedication; yet though I cannot lye like them, I am as vain as they, and cannot but publickly give your Grace my humble acknowledgments for the favours I have receiv'd from you: This, I say, is the Poets Gratitude, which in plain English, is only Pride and Ambition; and that the world might know your Grace did me the honour to see my Play twice together; yet perhaps my Enviers of your Favour will suggest 'twas in Lent, and therefore for your Mortification; then, as a jealous Author, I am concern'd not to have your Graces Favours lessen'd, or rather, my reputation; and to let them know, you were pleas'd, after that, to command a Copy from me of this Play; the way without Beauty and Wit, to win a poor Poets heart. 'Tis a sign your Grace understands nothing better, then obliging all the world, after the best and most proper manner; But, Madam, to be obliging to that excess as you are, (pardon me, if I tell you, out of my extream concern, and service for your Grace) is a dangerous quality, and may be very incommode to you; for Civility makes Poets as troublesom, as Charity makes Beggers; and your Grace will be hereafter as much pester'd with such scurvy Offerings as this, Poems, Panegyricks, and the like, as you are now with Petitions: And, Madam, take it from me, no man with Papers in's hand, is more dreadful then a Poet, no, not a Lawyer with his Declarations; Your Grace sure did not well consider what you did, in sending for my Play; you little thought I wou'd have had the confidence to send you a Dedication too: But, Madam, you find I am as unreasonable, and have as little conscience, as if I had driven the Poetick trade
     <pb xml:id="ep000790-003-b"/>
     longer then I have, and ne're consider you had enough of the Play; but (having suffer'd now so severely) I beseech your Grace, have a care for the future, take my Counsel, and be (if you can possible) as proud, and ill-natur'd, as other people of Quality, since your quiet is so much concern'd, and since you have more reason then any to value your self; for you have that perfection of Beauty (without thinking it so) which others of your Sex, but think they have; that Generosity in your Actions, which others of your quality, have only in their Promises; that Spirit, Wit, and Judgment, and all other qualifications, which fit Hero's to command, and wou'd make any but your Grace proud. I begin now elevated by my Subject, to write with the Emotion and Fury of a Poet; yet the integrity of an Historian; and I cou'd never be weary, nay, sure this were my only way, to make my Readers never weary too, though they were a more impatient Generation of people then they are. In Fine, speaking thus of your Grace, I shou'd please all the world but you; therefore I must once observe, and obey you&#9642; against my will, and say no more, then that I am,
    </p>

     CVstom, which bids the Thief from Cart Harangue,
    </l>
    <l>
     All those that come to make, and see him hang,
    </l>
    <l>
     Wills the damn'd Poet (though he knows he's gone)
    </l>
    <l>
     To greet you, e're his Execution.
    </l>
    <l>
     Not having fear of Critick 'fore his eyes,
    </l>
    <l>
     But still rejecting, wholsome, good advice;
    </l>
    <l>
     He e'en is come to suffer here to day,
    </l>
    <l>
     For counterfeiting (as you judge) a Play,
    </l>
    <l>
     Which is against dread Phoebus highest treason,
    </l>
    <l>
     Damn'd damning Judges, therefore you have reason;
    </l>
    <l>
     You he do's mean, who for the self same fault,
    </l>
    <l>
     That damning Priviledge of yours have bought;
    </l>
    <l>
     So the huge Bankers when they needs must fail,
    </l>
    <l>
     Send the small Brothers of their trade to Goal;
    </l>
    <l>
     Whilst they by breaking Gentlemen, are made,
    </l>
    <l>
     Then more then any scorn, poor men o'th trade;
    </l>
    <l>
     You hardn'd Renegado Poets, who
    </l>
    <l>
     Treat Riming Brother, worse then Turk wou'd do;
    </l>
    <l>
     But vent your Heathenish rage, hang, draw, and quarter,
    </l>
    <l>
     His Muse will dye to day a fleering Martyr;
    </l>
    <l>
     Since for ball'd Jest, dull Libel, or Lampoon,
    </l>
    <l>
     There are who suffer persecution,
    </l>
    <l>
     With the undaunted briskness of Buffon,
    </l>
    <l>
     And strict Professors live of Raillery,
    </l>
    <l>
     Defying Porters Lodge, or Pillory:
    </l>
    <l>
     For those who yet write on our Poets fate,
    </l>
    <l>
     Shou'd as Co-sufferers commiserate;
    </l>
    <l>
     But he in vain their pity now wou'd crave,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who for themselves (alas) no pity have,
    </l>
    <l>
     And their own gasping credit will not save;
    </l>
    <l>
     And those, much less, our Criminal wou'd spare,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who ne'r in Rhyme transgress, (if such there are)
    </l>
    <l>
     Well then, who nothing hopes, needs nothing fear;
    </l>
    <l>
     And he, before your cruel Votes shall do it,
    </l>
    <l>
     By his despair, declares himself no Poet.

        There are as many degrees of Wits, as of Lawyers; as there is first your Sollicitor, then your Aturney, then your Pleading-Counsel, then your Chamber-Counsel, and then your Judge; so there is first your Court-Wit, your Coffee-Wit, your Poll-Wit or Pollitick-Wit, your Chamber-Wit or Scribble-Wit, and last of all, your Judg-Wit or Critick.

        First, your Court-Wit is a fashionable, insinuating, flattering, cringing, grimacing, fellow; and has wit enough to sollicit a suit of Love; and if he fail, he has malice enough to ruin the woman with a dull Lampoon, but he rails still at the man that is absent, for you must know, all Wits rail; and his wit properly lies in combing Perruques, matching Ribbonds, and being severe as they call it, upon other peoples cloaths.

        Cousin Lydia, I had rather suspect your faith too, then you shou'd mine; therefore let us even marry to morrow, that I may have my turn of watching, doging, standing under the window at the dore, behind the hanging or&#8212;

        But if I cou'd be desperate now, and give you up my liberty; cou'd you find in your heart to quit all other engagements, and voluntarily turn your self over to one woman, and she a Wife too? cou'd you away with the insupportable bondage of Matrimony?

        You talk of Matrimony as irreverently, as my Lady Flippant; the Bondage of Matrimony, no&#8212;

     NOW my Brisk Brothers of the Pit, you'l say,
    </l>
    <l>
     I'm come to speak a good word for the Play;
    </l>
    <l>
     But (Gallants) let me perish, if I do,
    </l>
    <l>
     For I have Wit, and judgment, just like you;
    </l>
    <l>
     Wit never partial, judgment free and bold,
    </l>
    <l>
     For fear or friendship never bought or sold,
    </l>
    <l>
     Nor by good Nature, e're to be Cajol'd.
    </l>
    <l>
     Good Nature in a Critick were a crime,
    </l>
    <l>
     Like mercy in a Judge, and renders him
    </l>
    <l>
     Guilty of all those faults, he do's forgive:
    </l>
    <l>
     Besides, if Thief from Gallows you reprieve,
    </l>
    <l>
     He'll cut your Throat; so Poet sav'd from shame,
    </l>
    <l>
     In damn'd Lampoon, will murder your good name.
    </l>
    <l>
     Yet in true spight to him, and to his Play,
    </l>
    <l>
     (Good faith) you shou'd not rayl at 'em to day;
    </l>
    <l>
     But to be more his Foe, seem most his Friend,
    </l>
    <l>
     And so maliciously, the Play commend,
    </l>
    <l>
     That he may be betray'd to Writing on,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Poet let him be, to be undone.
