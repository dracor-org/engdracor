        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LADY Katherine Herbert. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>NEver till this time could I suspect that it was an easier thing for me to be the Author of a Play, than to write this Dedication to my mind; but now I confesse, so awful is my Patronesse, and so humble and zealous my pretensions in this kind, that unlesse I could bring an offering that might far surpasse whatever has <pb xml:id="ep000479-003-a"/>went before it, I should think it too mean for your acceptance; and for the reason that having been allow'd, and pass'd the sufferages of the most curious Criticks in the Theatre, I should be the more unfortunate to be at last Shipwrack'd in the Haven, by an opinion of my Dedication, whereof some of the leading Wits in these times have been censur'd; how hard is it then for a young Writer to please this delicate Age, wherein every year the Wits study the fashion of Language to refine, and alter it, as they do their Cloathes; and true it is, that 'tis another thing to write the sence and speeches of Heroes that are dead, and make 'em speak as we please, govern'd by our fancy, then it is to reach the minds of those illustrious Persons that Poetry is forc'd to choose to be above its Iudges, the Patrons of Wit: For in our Playes you read your own Characters, and they are at best but what we have gathered from you, who daily act among yourselves in conversation, (in a lighter <pb xml:id="ep000479-003-b"/>Orb) what none of the greatest, and indeed barbarous Courts could ever attain to; and good Poets are at the best but like bad Painters, that only shew you the shadowes of your selves, grosly daub'd, without imitating the least spark of the bright original. With what reverence and caution then ought I to approach you, Madam, whose Nobility and Vertue are in the Sanctuary of so divine a shape, that 'tis an excuse for all that see you to give their Souls no liberty to speak or think prophanely of you, but justly to be confin'd to admiration, and the whole World will say as well as I, that all that it has heard of Angels, are to be seen in you, and likethem too, you are adorn'd with so heavenly a Spring of Youth, as if you were to blossome to Eternity, or as if you were indeed the secret Goddesse of Divine Nature discloss'd, that every year makes Vegetables grow, and all the Living receive a hidden and diffusive pleasure from her influence. You are the greatest blessing the Almighty has <pb xml:id="ep000479-004-a"/>design'd to that incomparable Person your Father as a Reward for his Iustice and Loyalty in that most eminent Place, wherein Heaven, and the wisest Prince has set him, as the richest and most adorning Iewel of his Crown, and a continual and faithful Steward to this Nation, and no doubt, for its preservation and welfare, all England as well as my self, does pray, that he may long live the worthy and indeared Servant of such a grateful and Royal Master. To you, Madam, therefore, before I conclude, I am to beg a protection for this worthlesse Poem, the product of some melancholly hours, and not of my businesse: And if perhaps I have in this my first undertaking, like a raw and unpractic'd Magician in his Art, rais'd to my self the envy of some malicious and troublesome Spirits, which I have not the skill nor courage to lay, I have therefore wisely invok'd you for my Deitie: for neither Criticks nor Devils, I am sure, can presume to hurt me in that Circle, which your Name <pb xml:id="ep000479-004-b"/>has guarded and made sacred. Let the modesty of the Stilemake an atonement for the meannesse of the Language, and if your throughly discerning judgement, and beauteous Eyes, like the Sun, discover motes and spots in what you read, you have clemency and goodnesse in abundance to forgive them, and impute 'em to the inartificial dresse of a Virgin Muse; in my next she may appear more curious. I bring in my behalf too the Conqueror of the World, to lay before your feet, the greatest Man that ever was, who, were he living, wou'd become a Rival to his dear Ephestion, and behold in your Person, as well the sweet, serene, and obliging Innocence of Parisatis, as the more lofty and Imperial Graces of his Statira. This great Man, Madam, the Author of the famous Cassandra thought never to be equall'd, but in the person of the most exquisite of Lovers, him therefore he has rais'd in the Character of Oroondates, to be a Rival to the mighty Alexander in the Romance, and here I <pb xml:id="ep000479-005-a"/>have brought him to be so in you, and the rather, because I prefer him to the likenesse of the young, hopeful, and gallant Partner of your self, which I pray he may never cease to be, but early anticipate the extraordinary expectations of Mankind, and crown you with greater happinesse then Fame and Fancy have yet created in the minds of the most Heroick Lovers. This, and whatever increases your felicity shall be the perpetual wishes of, Madam, </p>

        <l>A just admirer of your gallant Sex; </l>
        <l>He is your Poet, and a Lover too, </l>
        <l>For chiefly he design'd this Play for you; </l>
        <l>If you can find but in it Love or Wit, </l>
        <l>He vowes he can out love what he has writ: </l>
        <l>Bids me remember e're you be displeas'd, </l>
        <l>How with Cassandra's fam'd Romance ye were pleas'd; </l>
        <l>How many nights 't has kept you long awake, </l>
        <l>Nay and have wept for Oroondates sake. </l>
        <l>When so good natur'd to him, but in thought, </l>
        <l>Be but so kind where he himself has brought. </l>
        <l>For your new Poet next I must implore; </l>
        <l>Dash not his hopes of this on any score; </l>
        <l>For if you do— </l>
        <l>He is so modest he will write no more. </l>
        <l>Disperse the stormes with your fair smiles and eyes, </l>
        <l>That from the rage of Blustring Criticks rise; </l>
        <l>And as the Tempest gathers in the Pit </l>
        <l>Let the bright Boxes beams then scatter it, </l>
