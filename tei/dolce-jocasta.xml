          <p>BEfore the beginning of this seconde Acte dyd sound a very doleful noise of flutes, during the which there came in vpon the stage two coffines couered with hearce clothes, &amp; brought in by .viij. in mourning weed, &amp; accompanied with .viij. other mourners, &amp; after they had caried the coffins about the stage, there opened &amp; appeared a Graue, wherin they buried the coffins &amp; put fire to them, but the flames did seuer &amp; parte in twaine, signifying discord by the history of two brethren, whose discord in their life was not onely to be wondred at, but being buried both in one Tombe (as some writers affirme) the flames of their funeralls did yet part the one from the other in like manner, and would in no wise ioyne into one flame. After the Funerals were ended and the fire consumed, the graue was closed vp again, the mourners withdrew them off the stage, &amp; immediately by the gates Homoloydes entred Pollinyces accompanied with vj. gentlemen and a page that carried his helmet and Target, he &amp; his men vnarmed sauing their gorgets, for that they were permitted to come into the towne in time of truce, to the end Iocasta might bring the two brethren to a parle, and Pollinyces after good regard taken round about him, spake as followeth. </p>

          <p>BEfore the beginning of this fourth Acte, the Trumpets sounded, the drummes and fifes, and a greate peale of ordinaunce was shot of, in the which ther entred vpon the stage .vj. knights armed at al points, whereof three came in by the Gates Electrae, and the other foure by the Gates Homoloides, either parte beeing accompanied <pb n="130" xml:id="ep000028-066-a"/>with vij, other armed men: and after they had marched twice or thrice about the Stage, the one partie menacing the other by their furious lookes and gestures, the .vj. knights caused their other attendants to stand by, and drawing their Swords, fell to cruell and couragious combate, continuing therein, till two on the one side were slayne: the third perceiuing, that he only remayned to withstand the force of .iij. enemies, did politiquely runne aside, wherewith immediatly one of the .iij. followed after him, and when he hadde drawen his enimie thus from his companie, hee turned againe and slewe him: Then the seconde also ranne after him, whome he slewe in like manner, and consequently the thirde, and then triumphantly marched aboute the Stage with hys sword in his hand. Hereby was noted the incomparable force of concord betweene brethren, who as long as they holde togither may not easily by any meanes be ouercome, and being once disseuered by any meanes, are easily ouerthrowen. The history of the brethren Horatij &amp; Curiatij, who agreed to like combate and came to like ende. After that the dead carkasses were caried from the Stage by the armed men on both parties, and that the victor was triumphantly accompanied out, also came in a messanger armed from the campe, seeking the Queene, and to hir spake as followeth. </p>

          <l>Of kingly rule, and sway of royall seate, </l>
