          <hi>Spoken by </hi>Mr. Goodman. </stage>
        <l>WHat think ye meant wise Providence, when first </l>
        <l>Poets were made? I'd tell you, if I durst, </l>
        <l>That 'twas in Contradiction to Heaven's Word, </l>
        <l>That when its Spirit o're the Waters stir'd, </l>
        <l>When it saw All, and said That All was good, </l>
        <l>The Creature Poet was not understood. </l>
        <l>For, were it worth the Pains of six long Days, </l>
        <l>To mould Retailers of dull Third-Day-Plays, </l>
        <l>That starve out threescore Years in hopes of Bays. </l>
        <l>'Tis plain they ne're were of the first Creation, </l>
        <l>But came by meer Equiv'cal Generation. </l>
        <l>Like Rats in Ships, without Coition bred; </l>
        <l>As hated too as they are, and unfed. </l>
        <l>Nature their Species sure must needs disown, </l>
        <l>Scarce knowing Poets, less by Poets known. </l>
        <l>Yet this poor Thing, so scorn'd, and set at nought, </l>
        <l>Ye all pretend to, and would fain be thought. </l>
        <l>Disabl'd wasting Whore-Masters are not </l>
        <l>Prouder to own the Brats they never got, </l>
        <l>Than Fumbling, Itching Rhimers of the Town, </l>
        <l>T' adopt some base-born Song that's not their own. </l>
        <l>Spite of his State, <hi>My Lord </hi>sometimes descends, </l>
        <l>To please the Importunity of Friends. </l>
        <l>The dullest he thought most for Business fit, </l>
        <l>'Twill venture his bought Place, to aim at Wit. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000618-004-a"/>
        <l>And though he sinks with his Imploys of State, </l>
        <l>Till Common Sense forsake him, he'll Translate. </l>
        <l>The Poet and the Whore alike complains, </l>
        <l>Of trading Quality, that spoils their Gains; </l>
        <l>The Lords will Write, and Ladies will have Swains. </l>
        <l>Therefore, all you who have Male Issue born, </l>
        <l>Under the Starving Sign of Capricorn; </l>
        <l>Prevent the Malice of their Stars in time, </l>
        <l>And warn them early from the Sin of Rhime: </l>
        <l>Tell 'em how Spencer starv'd, how Cowley mourn'd, </l>
        <l>How Butler's Faith and Service was return'd; </l>
        <l>And if such Warning they refuse to take, </l>
        <l>This last Experiment, O Parents, make! </l>
        <l>With Hands behind them see the Offender ty'd, </l>
        <l>The Parish Whip, and Beadle by his side. </l>
        <l>Then lead him to some Stall that does expose </l>
        <l>The Authors he loves most, there rub his Nose; </l>
        <l>Till like a Spaniel lash'd, to know Command, </l>
        <l>He by the due Correction understand, </l>
        <l>To keep his Brains clean, and not foul the Land. </l>
        <l>Till he against his Nature learn to strive, </l>
        <l>And get the Knack of Dullness how to thrive. </l>

        <stage xml:id="ep000618-e2340">Spoken by <hi>Mrs. COOK</hi>. </stage>
        <l>OUr Hero's happy in the Plays Conclusion, </l>
        <l>The holy Rogue at last has met Confusion: </l>
        <l>Though Arius all along appear'd a Saint, </l>
        <l>The last Act shew'd him a true Protestant. </l>
        <l>Eusebius, (for you know I read Greek Authors) </l>
        <l>Reports, that after all these Plots and Slaughters, </l>
        <l>The Court of Constantine was full of Glory, </l>
        <l>And every Trimmer turn'd Addressing Tory; </l>
        <l>They follow'd him in Herds as they were mad: </l>
        <l>When Clause was King, then all the World was glad. </l>
        <l>Whiggs kept the Places they possest before, </l>
        <l>And most were in a way of getting more; </l>
        <l>Which was as much as saying, Gentlemen, </l>
        <l>Here's Power and Money to be Rogues again. </l>
        <l>Indeed there were a sort of peaking Tools, </l>
        <l>Some call them Modest, but I call 'em Fools, </l>
        <l>Men much more Loyal, tho not half so loud; </l>
        <l>But these poor Devils were cast behind the Croud. </l>
        <l>For bold Knaves thrive without one Grain of Sense, </l>
        <l>But good Men starve for want of Impudence. </l>
        <l>Besides all these, there were a sort of Wights, </l>
        <l>(I think my Author calls them <hi>Teckelites;</hi>) </l>
        <l>Such hearty Rogues against the King and Laws, </l>
        <l>They favour'd even a Foreign Rebel's Cause. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000618-005-a"/>
        <l>When their own damn'd Design was quash'd and aw'd, </l>
        <l>At least they gave it their good Word abroad. </l>
        <l>As many a Man, who, for a quiet Life, </l>
        <l>Breeds out his Bastard, not to nose his Wife. </l>
        <l>Thus o're their Darling Plot these Trimmers cry; </l>
        <l>And though they cannot keep it in their Eye, </l>
        <l>They bind it Prentice to <hi>Count Teckely</hi>. </l>
        <l>They believe not the last Plot, may I be curst, </l>
        <l>If I believe they e're believ'd the first. </l>
        <l>No wonder their own Plot, no Plot they think; </l>
        <l>The Man that makes it, never smells the Stink. </l>
        <l>And, now it comes into my Head, I'll tell </l>
        <l>Why these damn'd Trimmers lov'd the Turks so well. </l>
        <l>The Original Trimmer, though a Friend to no Man, </l>
        <l>Yet in his Heart ador'd a pretty Woman: </l>
        <l>He knew that Mahomet laid up for ever, </l>
        <l>Kind Black-ey'd Rogues, for every true Believer: </l>
        <l>And, which was more than mortal Man e're tasted, </l>
        <l>One Pleasure that for threescore Twelve-months lasted: </l>
        <l>To turn for this, may surely be forgiven: </l>
        <l>who'd not be circumcis'd for such a Heav'n! </l>
