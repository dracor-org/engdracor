        <head>To the Right Honourable Charles Mountague, ONE OF THE Lords of the TREASURY. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Heartily wish this Play were as perfect as I intended it, that it might be more worthy your acceptance; and that my Dedication of it to you, might be more becoming that Honour and Esteem which I, with every Body, who are so fortunate as to know you, have for you. It had your Countenance when yet unknown; and now it is made publick, it wants your Protection. </p>
        <p>And give me leave, without any Flattery to you, or Vanity in my self, to tell my Illiterate Criticks, as an answer to their Impotent Objections, that they have found fault with that, which has been pleasing to you. This Play in relation to my concern for its Reputation, succeeded before it was Acted, for thro' your early Patronage it had an audience of several Persons of the first Rank <pb xml:id="ep000490-003-a"/>both in Wit and Quality; and their allowance of it, was a Consequence of your approbation. Therefore if I really wish it might have had a more popular reception; it is not at all in consideration of my self; but because I wish well, and would gladly contribute to the benefit of the Stage, and diversion of the Town. They were (not long since) so kind to a very imperfect Comedy of mine, that I thought my self justly indebted to them all my endeavours for an entertainment that might merit some little of that Applause, which they were so lavish of, when I thought I had no Title to it. But I find they are to be treated cheaply, and I have been at an unnecessary expence. </p>
        <p>I would not have any Body imagine, that I think this Play without its Faults, for I am Conscious of several, and ready to own 'em; but it shall be to those who are able to find 'em out. I confess I design'd (whatever Vanity or Ambition occasion'd that design) to have written a true and regular Comedy, but I found it an undertaking which put me in mind of— <hi>Sudes multum, frustraque laboret 〈◊〉. </hi>And now to make amends for the vanity of such a design, I do confess both the attempt, and the imperfect performance. Yet I must take the boldness to say, I have not miscarried in the whole; for the Mechanical part of it is perfect. That, I may say with as little vanity, as a Builder may say he has built <pb xml:id="ep000490-003-b"/>a House according to the Model laid down before him; or a Gardiner that he has set his Flowers in a knot of such or such a Figure. I design'd the Moral first, and to that Moral I invented the Fable, and do not know that I have borrow'd one hint of it any where. I made the Plot as strong as I could, because it was single, and I made it single, because I would avoid confusion, and was resolved to preserve the three Unities of the Drama, which I have visibly done to the utmost severity. This is what I ought not to observe upon my self; but the Ignorance and Malice of the greater part of the Audience is such, that they would make a Man turn Herauld to his own Play, and Blazon every Character. However, Sir, this Discourse is very impertinent to you; whose Judgment, much better can discern the Faults, than I can excuse them; and whose good Nature, like that of a Lover, will find out those hidden Beauties (if there are any such) which it would be great immodesty in me to discover. I think I don't speak improperly when I call you a 〈◊〉 of Poetry; for it is very well known the 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 to you; she has not deny'd you the least favour; you have injoy'd her, and she has been fruitful in a most Beautiful Issue— If I break off abruptly here, I hope every Body will understand that it is to avoid a Commendation, which, as it is your due, would be most easie for me to pay, and too troublesome for you to receive. </p>
        <pb rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000490-004-a"/>
        <p>I have since the Acting of this Play hearkned after the Objections which have been made to it; for I was Conscious where a true Critick might have put me upon my defence. I was prepared for their Attack; and am pretty confident I could have vindicated some parts, and excused others; and where there were any plain Miscarriages, I would most ingenuously have confess'd 'em. But I have not heard any thing said sufficient to provoke an Answer. Some little snarling and barking there has been, but I don't know one well-mouth'd Curr that has opened at all. That, which looks most like an Objection, does not relate in particular to this Play, but to all or most that ever have been written; and that is Soliloquy. Therefore I will answer it, not only for my own sake, but to save others the trouble, to whom it may hereafter be Objected. </p>
        <p>I grant, that for a Man to Talk to himself, appears absurd and unnatural; and indeed it is so in most Cases; but the circumstances which may attend the occasion, make great alteration. It oftentimes happens to a Man to have designs which require him to 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 their Nature, cannot admit 〈◊〉 〈◊〉. Such, for certain, is all Vanity and other less mischievous intentions may be very improper to be Communicated to a second Person. In such a case therefore the Audience must observe, whether the Person upon the Stage takes any notice of them <pb xml:id="ep000490-004-b"/>at all, or no. For if he supposes any one to be by, when he talks to himself, it is monstrous and ridiculous to the last degree. Nay, not only in this case, but in any part of a Play, if there is expressed any knowledge of an Audience, it is insufferable. But otherwise when a Man in Soliloquy reasons with himself, and Pro's and Con's, and weighs all his Designs: We ought not to imagine that this Man either talks to us, or to himself; he is only thinking, and thinking such Matter, as were inexcusable Folly in him to speak. But because we are conceal'd Spectators of the Plot in agitation, and the Poet finds it necessary to let us know the whole Mystery of his Contrivance; he is willing to inform us of this Persons Thoughts, and to that end is forced to make use of the expedient of Speech, no other better way being yet invented for the Communication of Thought. </p>
        <p>Another very wrong Objection has been made by some who have not taken leisure to distinguish the Characters. The Hero of the Play as they, are pleas'd to tell him▪ (meaning Mellefont) is a Gull, and made a Fool and cheared. Is every Man a Gull and a Fool that 〈◊〉? At that rate I'm afraid the two Classes of Men, will be reduc'd to one, and the Knaves themselves be at a loss to justifie their Title: But if an Open-hearted Honest Man, who has an entire Confidence in one whom he takes to be his Friend, and <pb xml:id="ep000490-005-a"/>whom he has obliged to be so; and who (to confirm him in his Opinion) in all appearance, and upon several tryals has been so: If this Man be deceived by the Treachery of the other; must he of necessity commence Fool immediately, only because the other has proved a Villain? Ay, but there was Caution given to Mellefont in the first Act by his Friend Careless. Of what Nature was that Caution? Only to give the Audience some light into the Character of Maskwell, before his appearance; and not to convince Mellefont of his Treachery; for that was more than Careless was then able to do: He never knew Maskwell guilty of any Villany; he was only a sort of Man which he did not like. As for his suspecting his Familiarity with my Lady Touchwood: Let 'em examine the Answer that Mellefont makes him, and compare it with the Conduct of Maskwell's Character through the Play. </p>
        <p>I would have 'em again look into the Character of Maskwell, before they accuse any Body of weakness for being deceiv'd by him. For upon summing up the enquiry into this 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 find they have only mistaken Cunning in who Character, for Fully 〈◊〉. </p>
        <p>But there is one thing which I am more concerned than all the false Criticisms that are made upon me; and that is, some of the Ladies are offended: I am heartily sorry for it, for I declare I would rather disoblige all the Criticks <pb xml:id="ep000490-005-b"/>in the World, than one of the Fair Sex. They are concerned that I have represented some Women Vicious and Affected: How can I help it? It is the Business of a Comick Poet to paint the Vices and Follies of Humane kind; and there are but two Sexes that I know, <hi>viz. Men</hi>, and Women, which have a Title to Humanity: And if I leave one half of them out, the Work will be imperfect. I should be very glad of an opportunity to make my Complement to those Ladies who are offended: But they can no more expect it in a Comedy, than to be Tickled by a Surgeon, when he's letting 'em Blood. They who are Virtuous or Discreet, I'm sure cannot be offended, for such Characters as these distinguish them, and make their Beauties more shining and observ'd: And they who are of the other kind, may nevertheless pass for such, by seeming not to be displeased, or touched with the Satyr of this Comedy. Thus have they also wrongfully accused me of doing them a prejudice, when I have in reality done them a Service. </p>
        <p>I have heard some whispering, as if they intended to accuse this Play of Smuttiness and Bawdy: But I declare I took a particular care to avoid it, and if they find any in it, it is of their own making, for I did not design it to be so understood. But to avoid my saying any thing upon a Subject, which has been so admirably handled before, and for their better instruction, <pb rend="simple:additions" xml:id="ep000490-006-a"/>I earnestly recommend to their perusal, the Epistle Dedicatory before the Plain-Dealer. </p>
        <p>You will pardon me, Sir, for the freedom I take of making Answers to other People, in an Epistle which ought wholly to be sacred to you: But since I intend the Play to be so too, I hope I may take the more liberty of Justifying it, where it is in the right. I hear a great many of the Fools are angry at me, and I am glad of it; for I Writ at them, not to 'em. This is a bold confession, and yet I don't think I shall disoblige one Person by it; for no Body can take it to himself, without owning the Character. </p>
        <p>I must now, Sir, declare to the World, how kind you have been to my Endeavours; for in regard of what was well meant, you have excused what was ill perform'd, I beg you would continue the same Method in your acceptance of this Dedication. I know no other way of making a return to that Charity you shew'd, in protecting an Infant, but by Enrolling it in your Service, now that it is of Age and come into the World. Therefore be pleased to accept of this as an Acknowledgement of the Favour you have shewn me, and an earnest of the real Service and Gratitude of, </p>

        <head>To my Dear Friend Mr. Congreve, On His COMEDY, call'd, The Double-Dealer. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>WELL then; the promis'd hour is come at last; </l>
          <l>The present Age of Wit obscures the past: </l>
          <l>Strong were our Syres; and as they Fought they Writ, </l>
          <l>Conqu'ring with force of Arms, and dint of Wit; </l>
          <l>Theirs was the Gyant Race, before the Flood; </l>
          <l>And thus, when Charles Return'd, our Empire stood. </l>
          <l>Like Janus he the stubborn Soil manur'd, </l>
          <l>With Rules of Husbandry the rankness cur'd: </l>
          <l>Tam'd us to manners, when the Stage was rude; </l>
          <l>And boistrous English Wit, with Art indu'd. </l>
          <l>Our Age was cultivated thus at length; </l>
          <l>But what we gain'd in skill we lost in strength. </l>
          <l>Our Builders were, with want of Genius, curst; </l>
          <l>The second Temple was not like the first: </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000490-007-a"/>
          <l>Till You, the best Vitruvius, come at length; </l>
          <l>Our Beauties equal; but excel our strength. </l>
          <l>Firm Dorique Pillars found Your solid Base: </l>
          <l>The Fair Corinthian Crowns the higher Space; </l>
          <l>Thus all below is Strength, and all above is Grace. </l>
          <l>In easie Dialogue is Fletcher's Praise: </l>
          <l>He mov'd the mind, but had not power to raise. </l>
          <l>Great Johnson did by strength of Iudgment please: </l>
          <l>Yet doubling Fletcher's Force, he wants his Ease. </l>
          <l>In differing Tallents both adorn'd their Age; </l>
          <l>One for the Study, t'other for the Stage. </l>
          <l>But both to Congreve justly shall submit, </l>
          <l>One match'd in Iudgment, both o'er-match'd in Wit </l>
          <l>In Him all Beauties of this Age we see; </l>
          <l>Etherege his Courtship, Southern's Purity; </l>
          <l>The Satire, Wit, and Strength of Manly Witcherly: </l>
          <l>All this in blooming Youth you have Atchiev'd; </l>
          <l>Now are your foil'd Contemporaries griev'd; </l>
          <l>So much the sweetness of your manners move, </l>
          <l>We cannot envy you because we Love. </l>
          <l>Fabius might joy in Scipio, when he saw </l>
          <l>A Beardless Consul made against the Law, </l>
          <l>And joyn his Suffrage to the Votes of Rome; </l>
          <l>Though He with Hannibal was overcome. </l>
          <l>Thus old Romano bow'd to Raphel's Fame; </l>
          <l>And Scholar to the Youth he taught, became. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Oh that your Brows my Lawrel had sustain'd, </l>
          <l>Well had I been Depos'd, if You had reign'd! </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000490-007-b"/>
          <l>The Father had descended for the Son; </l>
          <l>For only You are lineal to the Throne. </l>
          <l>Thus when the State one Edward did depose; </l>
          <l>A Greater Edward in his room arose. </l>
          <l>But now, not I, but Poetry is curs'd; </l>
          <l>For Tom the Second reigns like Tom the first. </l>
          <l>But let 'em not mistake my Patron's part; </l>
          <l>Nor call his Charity their own desert. </l>
          <l>Yet this I Prophecy; Thou shalt be seen, </l>
          <l>(Tho' with some short Parenthesis between:) </l>
          <l>High on the Throne of Wit; and seated there, </l>
          <l>Not mine (that's little) but thy Lawrel wear. </l>
          <l>Thy first attempt an early promise made; </l>
          <l>That early promise this has more than paid. </l>
          <l>So bold, yet so judiciously you dare, </l>
          <l>That Your least Praise, is to be Regular. </l>
          <l>Time, Place, and Action, may with pains be wrought, </l>
          <l>But Genius must be born; and never can be taught. </l>
          <l>This is Your Portion; this Your Native Store; </l>
          <l>Heav'n that but once was Prodigal before, </l>
          <l>To Shakespeare gave as much; she cou'd not give him more. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Maintain Your Post: That's all the Fame You need; </l>
          <l>For 'tis impossible you shou'd proceed. </l>
          <l>Already I am worn with Cares and Age; </l>
          <l>And just abandoning th'Ungrateful Stage: </l>
          <l>Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns expence, </l>
          <l>I live a Rent-charge on his Providence: </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000490-008-a"/>
          <l>But You, whom ev'ry Muse and Grace adorn, </l>
          <l>Whom I foresee to better Fortune born, </l>
          <l>Be kind to my Remains; and oh defend, </l>
          <l>Against Your Iudgment Your departed Friend! </l>
          <l>Let not the Insulting Foe my Fame pursue; </l>
          <l>But shade those Lawrels which descend to You: </l>
          <l>And take for Tribute what these Lines express: </l>
          <l>You merit more; nor cou'd my Love do less. </l>

              <p>True, but you shall judge whether I have not reason to be allarm'd. None besides you, and Maskwell, are acquainted with the Secret of my Aunt Touchwood's violent Passion for me. Since my first refusal of her Addresses, she has endeavour'd to do me all ill Offices with my Uncle; yet has managed 'em with that subtilty, that to him they have born the face of kindness; while her Malice, like a Dark Lanthorn, onely shone upon me, where it was directed. Still it gave me less perplexity to prevent the success of her displeasure, than to avoid the importunities of her Love; and of two evils, I thought my self favour'd in her aversion: But whether urged by her despair, and the short prospect of time she saw, to accomplish her designs; whether the hopes of her revenge, or of her Love, terminated in the view of this my Marriage with Cynthia, I know not; but this Morning she surpriz'd me in my Bed.— </p>

It was long before either of us spoke, Passion had ty'd her Tongue, and Amazement mine.— In short, the Consequence was thus, she omitted nothing, that the most violent Love could urge, or tender words express; which when she saw had no effect; but still I pleaded Honour and nearness of Blood to my Uncle; then came the Storm I fear'd at first: For starting from my Bed-side like a Fury, she flew to my Sword, and with much ado I prevented her doing me or her self a mischief: having disarm'd her; in a gust of Passion <pb n="5" xml:id="ep000490-011-b"/>she left me, and in a resolution, confirm'd by a Thousand Curses, not to close her Eyes, till she had seen my ruin. </p>

This discovery made me bold; I confess it; for by it, I thought you in my Power. Your Nephew's Scorn of you, added to my hopes; I watch'd the Occasion, and took you, just Repulsed by him, warm at once with Love and Indignation; your <pb n="12" xml:id="ep000490-015-a"/>Disposition, my Arguments, and happy Opportunity, accomplish'd my Design; I prest the yielding Minute, and was blest.

Then she has told me the whole History of Sir Paul's nine years Courtship; how he has lain for whole nights together upon the Stairs, before her Chamber-door; and that the first Favour he receiv'd from her, was a piece of an old Scarlet Petticoat for a Stomacher; which, since the day of his Marriage, he has, out of a piece of Gallantry, converted into a Night-Cap, and wears it still with much Solemnity on his anniversary Wedding-night. </p>

Did not she tell you at what a distance she keeps him. He has confess'd to me that but at some certain times, that is I suppose when she apprehends being with Child, he never has the privilege of using the familiarity of a Husband with his Wife. He was once given to scrambling with his hands and sprawling in his Sleep; and ever since she has him swaddled up in Blankets, and his hands and feet swath'd down, and so put to bed; and there he lies with a great Beard, like a Russian Bear upon a drift of Snow. You are very great with him, I wonder he never told you his Grievances, he will I warrant you. </p>

        <l>COuld Poets but forsee how Plays would take, </l>
        <l>Then they could tell what Epilogues to make; </l>
        <l>Whether to thank or blame their Audience▪ most: </l>
        <l>But that late knowledge, does much hazard cost, </l>
        <l>Till Dice are thrown, there's nothing won, nor lest. </l>
        <l>So till the Thief has stoli'n, he cannot know </l>
        <l>Whether he shall escape the Law, or no. </l>
        <l>But Poets run much greater hazards far, </l>
        <l>Than they who stand their Trials at the Barn; </l>
        <l>The Law provides a curb for ' its own Fury, </l>
        <l>And suffers Iudges to direct the Iury. </l>
        <l>But in this Court, what difference does appear! </l>
        <l>For every one's both Iudge and Iury here; </l>
        <l>Nay, and what's worse, an Executioner. </l>
        <l>All have a Right and Title to some part, </l>
        <l>Each chusing that, in which he has most Art. </l>
        <l>The dreadful men of Learning, all Confound, </l>
        <l>Unless the Fable's good, and Moral sound. </l>
        <l>The Vizor-Masks, that are in Pit and Gallery, </l>
        <l>Approve, or Damn the Repartee and Rallery. </l>
        <l>The Lady Criticks, who are better Read, </l>
        <l>Enquire if Characters are nicely bred; </l>
        <l>If the soft things are Penn'd and spoke with grace: </l>
        <l>They Iudge of Action too, and Time, and Place; </l>
        <l>In which, we do not doubt but they're discerning, </l>
        <l>For that's a kind of <hi>Assignation Learning</hi>. </l>
        <l>Beaus Iudge of Dress; the Witlings Iudge of Songs; </l>
        <l>The Cuckoldom, of Ancient Right, to Cits belongs. </l>
        <l>Thus poor Poets, the Favour are deny'd; </l>
        <l>Even to make exceptions, when they're Try'd. </l>
        <l>'Tis hard that they must every one admit; </l>
        <l>Methinks I see some Faces in the Pit, </l>
        <l>Which must of Consequence be Foes to Wit. </l>
        <l>You who can Iudge, to Sentence may proceed; </l>
        <l>But tho' he cannot Write, let him be freed </l>
        <l>At least from their Contempt, who cannot Read. </l>
