            <head>To the Honourable Sir <hi>WILLIAM LEVISON GOWER</hi>, Bar. </head>
            <p>THere is one kind of Vertue, which is inborn in the Nobility, and indeed in most of the Ancient Families of this Nation; they are not apt to insult on the Misfortunes of their Countrymen. But you, Sir, I may tell it you without Flattery, have grafted on this natural Commisseration, and rais'd it to a Nobler Vertue: As you have been pleas'd to honour me, for a long time, with some part of your Esteem and your good Will; so in particular, since the late Revolution, you have increas'd the Proofs of your kindness to me; and not suffer'd the difference of Opinions, which produce such Hatred and Enmity in the brutal Part of Human kind, to remove you from the settled Basis of your good Nature and good Sence. This Nobleness of yours, had it been exercis'd on an Enemy, had certainly been a Point of Honour, and as such I might have justly recommended it to the World: But that of constancy to your former Choice, and the pursuance of your first Favours, are Vertues not overcommon amongst English Men. All things of Honour have, at best, somewhat of Ostentation in them, and Self-love; there is a Pride of doing more than is expected from us, and more than others would have done. But to proceed in the same Tract of Goodness, Favour, and Protection, is to shew that a Man is acted by a thorough Principle: It carries somewhat of Tenderness in it, which is Humanity in a Heroical Degree; 'tis a kind of unmoveable good Nature; a word which is commonly Despis'd, because it is so seldom Practis'd. But after all, 'tis the most generous Vertue, oppos'd to the most degenerate Vice, which is <pb xml:id="ep000802-003-a"/>that of Ruggedness and Harshness to our Fellow Creatures. </p>
            <p>'Tis upon this knowledge of you, Sir, that I have chosen you, with your permission, to be the Patron of this Poem. And, as since this wonderful Revolution, I have begun with the best Pattern of Humanity, the Earl of Leicester; I shall continue to follow the same Method, in all, to whom I shall Address; and endeavour to pitch on such only, as have been pleas'd to own me in this Ruin of my small Fortune; who, though they are of a contrary Opinion themselves, yet blame not me for adhering to a lost Cause; and judging for my self, what I cannot chuse but judge; so long as I am a patient Sufferer, and no disturber of the Government. Which, if it be a severe Penance, as a great Wit has told the World, 'tis at least enjoyn'd me by my self: And <hi>Sancho Panca</hi>, as much a Fool as I, was observ'd to discipline his Body, no farther than he found he could endure the smart. </p>
            <p>You see, Sir, I am not entertaining you, like Ovid, with a Lamentable Epistle from Pontus; I suffer no more, than I can easily undergo; and so long as I enjoy my Liberty, which is the Birth-right of an English Man, the rest shall never go near my Heart. The Merry Philosopher, is more to my Humour than the Melancholick; and I find no disposition in my self to Cry, while the mad World is daily supplying me with such Occasions of Laughter. The more reasonable sort of my Country-men, have shewn so much favour to this Piece, that they give me no doubt of their Protection for the future. </p>
            <p>As you, Sir, have been pleas'd to follow the Example of their Goodness, in favouring me: So give me leave to say, that I follow yours in this Dedication, to a Person of a different Perswasion. Though I must confess withal, that I have had a former Encouragement from you for this Address; and the warm Remembrance of your noble Hospitality to me at <pb xml:id="ep000802-003-b"/>Trentham, when some years a go I visited my Friends and Relations in your Country, has ever since given me a violent Temptation to this boldness. </p>
            <p>‛ Tris true, were this Comedy wholly mine, I should call it a Trifle, and perhaps not think it worth your Patronage; but when the Names of Plautus and Moliere are joyn'd in it; that is, the two greatest Names of Ancient and Modern Comedy, I must not presume so far on their Reputation, to think their best and most unquestion'd Productions can be term'd Little. I will not give you the trouble, of acquainting you what I have added, or alter'd in either of them, so much it may be for the worse; but only that the difference of our Stage from the Roman and the French did so require it. But I am affraid, for my own Interest, the World will too easily discover, that more than half of it is mine; and that the rest is rather a lame Imitation of their Excellencies, than a just Translation. 'Tis enough, that the Reader know by you, that I neither deserve nor desire any Applause from it: If I have perform'd any thing, 'tis the Genius of my Authors that inspir'd me; and if it has pleas'd in Representation, let the Actors share the Praise amongst themselves. As for Plautus and Moliere, they are dangerous People; and I am too weak a Gamester to put my self into their Form of Play. But what has been wanting on my Part, has been abundantly supplyed by the Excellent Composition of Mr. Purcell; in whose Person we have at length found an English-man, equal with the best abroad. At least my Opinion of him has been such, since his happy and judicious Performances in the late Opera; and the Experience I have had of him, in the setting my Three Songs for this Amphitryon: To all which, and particularly to the Composition of the <hi>Pastoral Dialogue</hi>, the numerous Quire of Fair Ladies gave so just an Applause on the Third Day. I am only sorry, for my own sake, that there was one <pb xml:id="ep000802-004-a"/>Star wanting, as Beautiful as any in our Hemisphere; that young Berenice, who is misimploying all her Charms on stupid Country Souls, that can never know the Value of them; and loosing the Triumphs, which are ready prepar'd for her in the Court and Town. And yet I know not whether I am so much a loser by her absence; for I have Reason to apprehend the sharpness of her Judgment, if it were not allay'd with the sweetness of her Nature; and after all, I fear she may come time enough, to discover a Thousand Imperfections in my Play, which might have pass'd on Vulgar Undestandings. Be pleas'd to use the Authority of a Father over her, on my behalf; enjoyn her to keep her own Thoughts of Amphitryon to her self; or at least not to compare him too strictly with Moliere's. 'Tis true, I have an Interest in this Partiality of hers; but withal, I plead some sort of Merit for it, in being so Particularly as I am, </p>

            <head>PROLOGUE TO Amphitryon; or, The Two Socia's. </head>
            <byline>Spoken by Mr. Bracegirdle. </byline>
            <l>THE lab'ring Bee, when his sharp Sting is gone, </l>
            <l>Forgets his Golden Work, and turns a Drone: </l>
            <l>Such is a Satyr, when you take away </l>
            <l>That Rage, in which his Noble Vigour lay. </l>
            <l>What gain you, by not suffering him to teize ye? </l>
            <l>He neither can offend you, now, nor please ye. </l>
            <l>The Honey-bag, and Venome, lay so near, </l>
            <l>That both, together, you resolv'd to tear; </l>
            <l>And lost your Pleasure, to secure your Fear. </l>
            <l>How can he show his Manhood, if you bind him </l>
            <l>To box, like Boys, with one Hand ty'd behind him? </l>
            <l>This is plain levelling of Wit; in which </l>
            <l>The Poor has all th' advantage, not the Rich. </l>
            <l>The Blockhead stands excus'd, for wanting Sense; </l>
            <l>And Wits turn Blockheads in their own defence. </l>
            <l>Yet, though the Stages Traffick is undone, </l>
            <l>Still Julian's interloping Trade goes on: </l>
            <l>Though Satyr on the Theatre you smother, </l>
            <l>Yet in Lampoons, you Libel one another. </l>
            <l>The first produces still, a second Jig; </l>
            <l>You whip 'em out, like School-boys, till they gig: </l>
            <l>And, with the same success, we Readers guess; </l>
            <l>For, ev'ry one, still dwindles to a less. </l>
            <l>And much good Malice, is so meanly drest, </l>
            <l>That we wou'd laugh, but cannot find the Jest. </l>
            <pb xml:id="ep000802-005-a"/>
            <l>If no advice your Rhiming Rage can stay, </l>
            <l>Let not the Ladies suffer in the Fray. </l>
            <l>Their tender Sex, is priviledg'd from War; </l>
            <l>'Tis not like Knights, to draw upon the Fair. </l>
            <l>What Fame expect you from so mean a Prize? </l>
            <l>We wear no murd'ring Weapons, but our Eyes. </l>
            <l>Our Sex, you know, was after yours design'd, </l>
            <l>The last Perfection of the Makers mind: </l>
            <l>Heav'n drew out all the Gold for us, and left your Dross behind. </l>
            <l>Beauty, for Valours best Reward, He chose; </l>
            <l>Peace, after War; and after Toil, Repose. </l>
            <l>Hence ye Prophane; excluded from our sights; </l>
            <l>And charm'd by Day, with Honour's vain delights, </l>
            <l>Go, make your best of solitary Nights. </l>
            <l>Recant betimes, 'tis prudence to submit: </l>
            <l>Our Sex, is still your Overmatch, in Wit: </l>
            <l>We never fail, with new, successful Arts, </l>
            <l>To make fine Fools of you; and all your Parts. </l>

            <byline>Spoken by Phaedra. Mrs. Mountfort. </byline>
            <lg>
              <l>I'M thinking, (and it almost makes me mad,) </l>
              <l>How sweet a time, those Heathen Ladies had. </l>
              <l>Idolatry, was ev'n their Gods own trade; </l>
              <l>They Worshipt the fine Creatures they had made. </l>
              <l>Cupid, was chief of all the Deities; </l>
              <l>And Love was all the fashion, in the Skies. </l>
              <l>When the sweet Nymph, held up the Lilly hand, </l>
              <l>Jove, was her humble Servant, at Command. </l>
              <l>The Treasury of Heav'n was ne're so bare, </l>
              <l>But still there was a Pension for the Fair. </l>
              <l>In all his Reign, Adultry was no Sin; </l>
              <l>For Jove, the good Example did begin. </l>
              <l>Mark, too when he usurp'd the Husband's name, </l>
              <l>How civilly he sav'd the Ladies fame, </l>
              <l>The secret Joys of Love, he wisely hid; </l>
              <l>But you, Sirs, boast of more, than e'er you did. </l>
              <l>You teize your Cuckolds; to their face torment 'em; </l>
              <l>But Jove gave his, new Honours to content 'em, </l>
              <l>And, in the kind remembrance of the Fair, </l>
              <l>On each exalted Son, bestow'd a Star. </l>
              <l>For those good deeds, as by the date appears, </l>
              <l>His Godship, flourish'd full Two thousand Years. </l>
              <l>At last, when He and all his Priests grew old, </l>
              <l>The Ladies grew in their devotion cold; </l>
              <l>And, that false Worship wou'd no longer hold. </l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
              <l>Severity of Life did next begin; </l>
              <l>(And always does, when we no more can Sin.) </l>
              <l>That Doctrine, too, so hard, in Practice, lyes, </l>
              <l>That, the next Age may see another rise. </l>
              <l>Then, Pagan Gods, may, once again, succeed; </l>
              <l>And Jove, or Mars, be ready, at our need, </l>
              <l>To get young Godlings; and, so, mend our breed. </l>
