        <opener>
          <salute>Madam, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Confess I am so transported at the Honour You have done this poor Play, that I know not in what Terms to pay my Devotion to Your Highness; I am not insensible too of my own Unworthiness, and that it is a Presumption even in the best of this Kind, to think to gain Admittance into the Closet <pb xml:id="ep000475-003-a"/>of so Great a Princess; But when I consider that no Present, of what Value soever, can be made suitable to One of Your Illustrious Character, It gives me Encouragement to hope this Trifle may not be less Acceptable to Your Royal Goodness, than a Pitcher of Water was to the Great Monarch of the World, from the Hands of a Mean Soldier. 'Twere Prophaneness in me any longer to divert with my rude Pen Your Divine Thoughts and Precious Moments, that are still imploy'd Above, in imploring Blessings for the Nation, and more prophane to sully the Chrystal Mirrour of so many Incomparable Virtues with the coarse Breath of Mortal Praise. </p>
        <p>I most humbly ask Leave then to withdraw from a Subject so much above my Capacity and Merit; (a Task fit only for the Angels You converse with,) and pray my Muse may have the Happiness to conclude, who groans to be deliver'd of her Duty, in these Homely, but Hearty Thanks. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000475-003-b"/>
        <l>Accept, <hi>Great Princess</hi>, this small Offering, </l>
        <l>This humble Mite I to your Treasure bring, </l>
        <l>The poor mean Present of a bended Muse, </l>
        <l>Amidst the Heaps of all the Wealthier Iews, </l>
        <l>A banish'd Play that tedious Years had mourn'd, </l>

        <l>The grateful Peasant thus before he's stor'd, </l>
        <l>Gives his first Fruits of Plenty to his Lord. </l>

        <l>'Tis just I give you what your self did make: </l>
        <l>For the Great Cyrus being but a Child, </l>
        <l>And in his Cradle destin'd to be kill'd, </l>
        <l>Your Highness his Divine Panthea now, </l>
        <l>Has rais'd him both to Empire and to You. </l>
        <l>The God of Love, who in the Scene departs, </l>
        <l>Bequeaths to You his Quiver and his Darts, </l>
        <l>And, what is more, his Title to all Hearts. </l>
        <l>Whilst at your Feet, the mighty Monarch lays </l>
        <l>His conquer'd Crowns, as humbly I the Bays. </l>
        <l>Happy was He that Presence to ingage, </l>
        <l>That chear'd the World, and brought to Life the Stage, </l>
        <l>Where the sad Muses, since they lost their Queen, </l>
        <l>Ne'er till that Day did tune their Songs agen. </l>
        <l>The ravish'd Crowds ador'd You as You rode, </l>
        <l>Like Spring in April coming first abroad. </l>
        <l>My humble Muse, then, that did groveling lye, </l>

        <head>PROLOGUE TO HER Royal Highness. </head>
        <l>WHen all that we thought great and good was gone, </l>
        <l>And the whole World did in that Deluge drown, </l>
        <l>When mourning Cupids flagg'd their tender Wings, </l>
        <l>And the sad Muses broke their warbling Strings; </l>
        <l>When she was fled that shin'd with Pity here, </l>
        <l>What cou'd revive the drooping Theatre!— </l>
        <l>But from the Phoenix Ashes in their Spice, </l>
        <l>Loe, I behold another Goddess rise. </l>
        <l>All Blessings that with her, great Princess, flew, </l>
        <l>Can never be restor'd us, but in You. </l>
        <l>The Dove in the glad Ark was not so kind, </l>
        <l>Who brought the Olive, and reviv'd Mankind. </l>
        <l>The Laurels fading now behind our Scene, </l>
        <l>Like Virgil's Grotto, shall be ever green. </l>
        <l>Let conquering William send abroad his Darts, </l>
        <l>Secure for him you rule his Peoples Hearts. </l>
        <l>And his soft Pledge only her self withdrew, </l>
        <l>Whilst all her Miracles succeed in You: </l>
        <l>Then let's to Heav'n in loudest Anthems sing </l>
        <l>That such bright Hopes we have, and such a King. </l>
