        <head>To the Generous Reader. </head>
        <p>COurteous Reader, the ancient Latin Adage is, Sultorum, but I say Nebulonum plena sunt omnia, Knaves be about all persons, and in all places. There are twelve Coat-Cards in the bunch, of which foure are Knaves, Heart, Diamond, Spade, Club, suiting with the foure C C C C: Court, City, Country, Campe: My purpose is not to touch any in particular; onely thus much of them in generall: some are notable, some notorious, some pimping, some panderly Knaves; some prating, some pestilent; some cousening, some cunny-catching Knaves. There are also lazy and lying, base, and deboist, fantasticall, foolish, and false Knaves. To these we may adde Hereticall and Hypocriticall, schismaticall, and separisticall Knaves: not forgetting perjur'd, and shamelesse; impudent, and informing; arrogant, and arrant Knaves, Cum multis alijs. And besides these, I have heard of a Knave Tapster, a Knave Ostler, a Knave Serjeant, and a Knave Broker: but with these we have nothing to doe at this time; onely with a Knave in graine, or a Knave new vampt, in decyphering of whom, I give all the rest this Caveat, Have amongst you my Masters: And now if any of the rest shall finde himselfe touch't, hee hath his mends in his owne hands, for he cannot say but I gave him faire warning. And so much of the Argument, the Act followes. </p>
