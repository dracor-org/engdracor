        <p>IOS and Smyrna were two sweete Cytties, the first named of the Violet, the latter of the Myrrh: Homer was borne in the one, and buried in the other; Your Maiesties iudgement and fauour, are our Sunne and shadowe, the one comming of your deepe wisedome, the other of your wonted grace. Wee in all humilitie desire, that by the former, receiuing our first breath, we may in the latter, take our last rest. </p>
        <p>Augustus Caesar had such pearcing eyes, that who so looked on him, was constrained to wincke. Your highnesse hath so perfit a iudgement, that what soeuer we offer, we are enforced to blush; yet as the Athenians were most curious, that the Lawne wherewith Minerua was couered, should be without spotte or wrinkle, <pb xml:id="ep000139-003-a"/>So haue we endeuoured with all care, that what wee present your Highnesse, shoulde neyther offend in Scaene nor sillable, knowing that as in the ground where Gold groweth, nothing will prosper but Golde, so in your Majestes minde, where nothing doth harbor but vertue, nothing can enter but vertue. </p>

              <p>HOwe nowe? what newe conceits, what strange contraries breede in thy minde? is thy Diana become a Venus, thy chast thoughts turnd to wanton lookes, thy conquering modestie to a captiue imagination? Beginnest thou with Piralis to die in the ayre and liue in the fire, to leaue the sweete delight of hunting, and to followe the hote desire of loue? O Telusa, these words are vnfit for thy sexe beeing a virgine, but apt for thy affections being a Louer. And can there in yeeres so young, in education so precise, in vowes so holy, and in a hart so chaste, enter eyther a strong desire, or a wish, or a wauering thought of loue? Can Cupids brands quench Vestas flames, and his feeble shafts headed with feathers, pearce deeper the Dianaes arrowes headed with steele? Breake thy bowe Telusa that seekest to breake thy vowe, and let those hands that aymed to hit the wilde Hart, scratche out those eyes that haue wounded thy tame hart. O vaine and onely naked name of Chastitie, that is made eternall, and perish by time: holy, and is infected by fancy: diuine, and is made mortall by folly. Virgins harts I perceiue are not vnlike Cotton trees, whose fruite is so hard in the budde, that it soundeth like steele, and beeing rype, poureth forth nothing but wool, and theyr thoughts like the leaues of Lunary, which the further they growe from the Sunne, the sooner they are scorched with his beames. O Melebeus, because thou art fayre, must I be fickle, and false my vowe because I see thy vertue? Fonde gyrle that I am to thinke of loue, nay vaine profession that I follow to disdaine loue, but heere commeth Eurota, I must nowe put on a redde <pb xml:id="ep000139-013-a"/>maske and blushe, least she perceiue my pale face and laugh. </p>

What greater dishonour could happen to Diana, or to her Nimphes shame, then that there can be any time so idle, that shold make their heads so addle? Your chast harts my Nimphes, should resemble the Onix, which is hotest when it is whitest, and your thoughts, the more they are assaulted with desires, the lesse they should be affected. You should thinke loue like Homers Moly, a white leafe &amp; a blacke roote, a faire shewe, and a bitter taste. Of all Trees the Cedar is greatest, and hath the smallest seedes: of all affections, loue hath the greatest name, &amp; <pb xml:id="ep000139-017-b"/>the least vertue. Shall it be said, and shall Venus say it? nay shall it be seene, and shall wantons see it? that Diana the goddesse of chastity, whose thoughts are alwaies answerable to her vowes, whose eyes neuer glanced on desire, and whose hart abateth the poynt of Cupids arrowes, shall haue her virgins to become vnchast in desires, immoderate in affection, vntemperate in loue, in foolish loue, in base loue. Eagles cast their euill feathers in the Sunne, but you cast your best desires vpon a shadowe. The birdes Ibes lose their sweetnesse when they lose theyr sights, and virgins all theyr vertues with theyr vnchast thoughts, vnchast, Diana calleth that, that hath eyther any showe or suspicion of lightnesse.

The Eagles fethers consume the fethers of all others, and loues desire corrupteth all other vertues. I blush Ladies that you hauing beene heretofore patient of labours, should nowe become prentises to idlenesse, and vse the penne for Sonets, not the needle for Samplers. And howe is your loue placed, vppon pelting boyes, perhaps base of birth, without doubt weake of discretion. I but they are fayre.

          <p>GOE all, tis I onely that conclude al. You Ladies may see, that Venus can make constancie ficklenes, courage cowardice, modestie lightnesse, working things impossible in your Sexe, and tempering hardest harts like softest wooll. Yeelde Ladies, yeeld to loue Ladies, which lurketh vnder your eye-lids whilst you sleepe, and plaieth with your hart strings whilst you wake: whose sweetnes neuer breedeth satietie, labour wearinesse, nor greefe bitternesse. Cupid was begotten in a miste, nursed in Clowdes, and sucking onelie vpon conceits. Confesse him a Conquerer, whom yee ought to regarde, sith it is vnpossible to resist, for this is infallible, that Loue conquereth all things but it selfe, and Ladies all harts but their owne. </p>
