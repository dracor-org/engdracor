If there be any in this Assembly, any dear Friend of Caesars, to him I say, that Brutus love to Caesar, was no less then his. If then that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I lov'd Caesar less, but that I lov'd Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living, and dye all Slaves; then that Caesar were dead, to live all Free-men? As Caesar lov'd me, I weep for him; as he was Fortunate, I rejoyce at it; as he was Valiant, I honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There is Tears, for his love: Joy, for his Fortune: Honour, for his Valour: And Death, for his Ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so rude, that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him have I offended. Who is here so vile, that will not love his Country? If any, speak, for him have I offended.

            <l>You all do know this Mantle I remember </l>
            <l>The first time ever Caesar put it on, </l>
            <l>'Twas on a Summers Evening in his Tent, </l>
            <l>That day he overcame the Nervii </l>
            <l>Look, in this place ran Cassius Dagger through: </l>
            <l>See what a rent the envious Caska made: </l>
            <l>Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stab'd, </l>
            <l>And as he pluck'd his cursed Steel away: </l>
            <l>Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it, </l>
            <l>As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd </l>
            <l>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd or no: </l>
            <l>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesars Angel. </l>
            <l>Judge, O ye Gods, how dearly Caesar lov'd him. </l>
            <l>This was the most unkindest cut of all. </l>
            <l>For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab, </l>
            <l>Ingratitude, more strong then Traitors arms, </l>
            <l>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart, </l>
            <l>And in his Mantle, Muffling up his face, </l>
            <l>Even at the Base of Pompeys Statue </l>
            <l>(Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. </l>
            <l>O what a fall was there, my Countrymen? </l>
            <l>Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, </l>
            <l>Whil'st bloody Treason flourish'd over us. </l>
            <l>O now you weep, and I perceive you feel </l>
            <l>The dint of pitty: These are gracious drops. </l>
