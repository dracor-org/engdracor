          <hi>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE HENRY </hi>Lord Marquess of Dorchester, Earl of Kingstone, Viscount Newark, Lord Pierrepont and Manvers, and one of the Lords of his Majesties most Honourable Privy Counsel, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WIsdome is attain'd by an exact disquisition after Truth: which seem'd once so difficult an attempt, that in Greece (the then knowing part of the World) seven only were accounted to deserve the name of Wise. Such commendable researches gain'd 'em that prae-eminence; and this made them prescribe to the rest of Mankind. They declar'd Truth (like precious Oar) bury'd in a Pit, not to be got thence, but by a long deduction of Reason; nor this Reason perfected without Study and Learning. Now Learning is only the cultivating of Parts and Wit, 'till we arrive at a thorough improvement of thoughts upon things and Men. </p>
        <p>My Lord, all this being consider'd, who can lay a juster claim to this Iewel, than your Lordship? Whose mind, being animated by generous spirits, always addresses it self unto noble ends? Your inward sight (sharper than that of Eagles) can gaze upon the splendeur where Truth'sits thron'd, and discern all the finesses of Policy and Prudence. Ablessing not to be attain'd without a sagacity able to pierce into the deepest resorts of Nature, and to extricate hidden forms from the Wombs of their Causes. But these Perfections (like th' Elixir of the Phylosophers) are impossible, or very difficult to be obtain'd, without such a prosperous success as your Lordships, that has run through the round of all Sciences, with a perspicacity even to admiration. You, my Lord, (like the Eye of the World) have not only visited, but inlighten'd each Orb in the Heaven of Learning. <pb xml:id="ep000747-003-a"/>And those who hence forward shall pretend to knowledge must owe it to your Influence. Wherever you past, you left such tracks of light, as may direct the inquisitive World into the most private recesses of knowledge. </p>
        <p>Besides, 'tis as wonderful how your Lordship could arrive to this height, to these miraculous improvements! How could you break through those intangling blandishments of Fortune? Those cumbersome imployments of Honour and State? Those tediousnesses of Address, that wait on and add to the tumults of Grandeur? For Greatmen (as th' incomparable Verulam observes) have little freedome either in their times, their actions, or themselves. Insomuch, as prae-eminence would afford no Aitraits, nor any pretences authorize the thirstings after Greatness, unless a power to do good. By such revelations of your merits and vertue, you have added lustre to your Coronet, and ennobled even Nobility it self. Vulgar Fame applauds Majesty in such choices and that commonstream runs here into the <hi>Fountain of Honour</hi>. </p>
        <p>If our Age had been unfortunate in wanting you, as that of the Romans had been happy in injoying you, Cicero might have spar'd his expectation (as he smartly worded it to Caesar) <q rend="hi">Quae miremur habemus, quae laudemus expectamus. </q>In our late Deluge of Ignorance and Rebellion, you stood up like one of <hi>Seth's Pillars</hi>, and preserv'd Letters and Loyalty to this happy Age. You were tost indeed, but not discompos'd with the humrous successes of Fortune. You steer'd your Resolutions, and kept a steady soul amidst those storms that shipwrackt three Kingdomes. In that fatal 41th. when those false <hi>Representatives of our Liberties </hi>(like Robbers) pretended to direct us into the right way, and then intrapt us into streights, to cut our Purses and our Throats: when by a horrid Conspiracy (like that of Corah) they rebell'd both against Moses and Aaron; when (like the ingrateful Hebrews) they wanten'd after <hi>impure Loves</hi>, and worshipt false Gods of their own making; Then you, my Lord, indeavour'd with all your might to rescue us from inhumanity and rapine, and divert Iudgments from the People, like Cicero in the Conspiracy of Catiline; (and with equal Eloquence) you labour'd to save both <hi>Capitol and Common-wealth </hi>from ruin. In testimony whereof, those two incomparable Speeches of your Lordships, to the <hi>House of Peers</hi>, in Defence of the Hierarchy, will be recorded in the Temple of Fame, till Time shall be no more. </p>
        <p>Nor is this all, for tho these great Truths must eternize your Name, and advantage the next Age with glorious examples; yet to come nearer <pb xml:id="ep000747-003-b"/>home, my Lord, the present time is as much oblig'd. Your Hospitality and <hi>way of living </hi>is such, as may instruct those of your Lordships rank to restore and uphold their ancient int'rest and grandeur, too much and too long neglected. Here is Plenty without Luxury and Intemperance, Greatness without Noise and Disorder: Entertainments are here be stowed both upon Mind and Body, and 'tis doubtful to which our Repasts are most oblig'd. </p>
        <p>But I'm fall'n upon a Panegyrick, where I intended a Dedication; and in both alike presumptuous; yet it may be the more excusable in that I have sacrific'd to Duty and Truth, in acknowledging your Lordships favours and my great obligations, and in yielding a Testimony to the merits of so eminent a Person. And after my Reader is confirm'd of all these great qualities, and hears how your Lordships pleas'd to countenance this Tragaedy; I need not fear his acceptation. You, my Lord, alone are a sufficient Theater, and your single praise more to be valu'd than the loudest Plaudite. I humbly beg, that your Lordship will vouchsafe to pardon all its falours, and accept of that devotion, wherewith I offer it, which will be an infinite honour to, </p>

        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>Since this Tragedy has gain'd your approbation; I ought to shew the care I took in't. I alter'd not the Story, nor made the Guises speak, or act worse than really they did. I branded not that <hi>damn'd League </hi>with such characters as I might have done, and they deserv'd. I fited the Parts to the Persons, and kept'em as like themselves as the Story would let me. I made both the <hi>Kings Amorous, Generous and Valiant, </hi>and so indeed they were; and endeavour'd they should not suffer upon a particular Stage, when they had triumpht upon that of the World. If Grillon seem'd overbold and rough sometimes in some places, I do but keep my self to that character which <hi>Mounsieur Girard</hi>, and D'Avila (with others) have bestow'd upon him. Nay his frequent Oath of Death was not my <ref target="A59968-e910-b"/>
          <note corresp="A59968-e910-a" place="inline">Espernon's Life, Book 4. p. 190. </note>fancy neither; For there's a Story in the Life of Espernon, enough to justifie me, and fright our Gallants from that profane humour. As for the rest, it was my aim they should not speak above themselves, and I suited (as well as I could) their Parts to their Callings. Yet after all this, I am not ignorant that I lie open to the Critick's in transferring the main Scene from Blois to St. Clou. But had I confin'd the Story to either of those Places alone, the death of the King or Guise might have been left out contrary to my original design. After all this, Sir, I crave leave to reflect a little, upon the very Rhime it self. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000747-004-b"/>
        <p>All Subjects of weight, or such as most int'rest the Passions, ought (as I take it) to be exprest with a gravity and in few words. Thus the <hi>Greek and Latine Tragedians</hi>, nay and Philosophers too, accustomed themselves to short Periods. But their Measures necessarily being inconstant, therefore to make 'em suitable to several occasions, AEschilus, and next after him Sophocles, when they brought the Stage to represent the Story more naturally, by introducing <hi>Actors and Scenes</hi>, they bethought themselves of a reformation, and dispos'd their Speeches into lines of more certain Measures to make them more grateful to the Audience. Let any man suppose a representation of some considerable length, to be perform'd in short sentences, and of unequal cadences, one cannot fancy any thing to be more wearisome. But when it runs in equal Measures, neither so at length to stretch the sinews of Discourse and Fancy, as upon a Rack, nor so short as to cramp 'em; but sizable both to the speaker and hearer, it must needs advance the satisfaction of both Parties, together with the reputation of the Poet. The Greek then and the <hi>Latine Tragedians </hi>(for I have nothing to say to those of France and Italy) mostly wrote in measur'd Verse. For Rhime never reacht them, 'till in a barbarous Monkish Age, which became soon weary of it, as unnatural to the Ideom, and destructive of their native Elegance. But, from the earli'st dawnings of knowledge, our Bards and Druids had their Genealogies and <hi>Songs of Victory </hi>in Rhime, as not only natural, but quickning the spirit of their Language; and we have continu'd it with competent success. For I refer it to any <pb xml:id="ep000747-005-a"/>ingenious rational person, that can write or Iudge, what briskness is infused into any fit Subject by a well ordered and an unforc'd Rhime. It is true, that one mans Prose exceeds another mans Verse; but suppose both those Talents to be equal in one and the same person, I dare say his Verse, as to sweetness and charms, will be much more agreeable than his <hi>Prose. I </hi>speak all this as to the content of the <hi>Ear and Fancy </hi>upon the Stage. I am not to answer here for bald Rhimes, that serve only to make bad sense worse, I speak of easie smooth Rhime in Verse, such as exalts Sense and makes it Rapture, nay I'm perswaded Oratory as well as Poetry, has a greater force upon our affections, when the periods contain a certain Measure, or at least when two or three of the closes have some affinity of sound. I never had it try'd (but may be 'tis worth the while to do it) whether those Orators that most please, make it not their Care to come off with a grateful Harmony in the Close. These are the Charms like those of <hi>natural Magick</hi>, that work unknown either to the Speaker or Hearer, yet gain far more attention to one man than to another. This is only to offer at some proof that a <hi>Paper of verses </hi>in Rhime, where the <hi>Conceit is new</hi>, the <hi>humour Surprizing</hi>, and the <hi>Penning Elegant</hi>, must needs take more in the repetition then any studied Prose. And a Speech on the Stage (be its Concerns what it will) must be far more harmonious and pleasing in Rhime, and more congenial to the <hi>Soul, Miltons Paradice </hi>is a work noble, strong and fanciful, but had his humour of contradiction soften'd it into his own sweet Rhime, what a <pb xml:id="ep000747-005-b"/>Poem had it been! but I dare not venture further upon this Subject, since that learn'd and facetious Gentleman, Mr. Rymer, has promis'd the undertaking, <ref target="A59968-e1630-b"/>

          </note>from whose curious and able hand I expect it with the impatience of a longing Woman, and indeed I'm abundantly pleas'd to find my perswasions strengthen'd by so Potent an Ally. </p>
        <p>And the more, when I hear some are Fugitives to their own perswasions, but inconstancy being the Running gout of the Soul, and natural to some persons both in their thinking and <hi>writing, I </hi>shall not say more of 'em, but that 'tis torment enough to groan out their remaining years in a helpless distemper. And now, Sir, I intend your ease in dismissing this Subject, which I assure you was impos'd on me first in discourse, and then I was desired to set it down at a venture: what ever it be I shall rather leave it to your better judgement, than pretend to dispute it, altho without all controversie, I am </p>

        <head>THE PROLOGUE Intended, and Part spoken by Mr. Hart. </head>
        <l>YOu're not t'expect to day the modists sport, </l>
        <l>Affronting either City, or the Court. </l>
        <l>Our Poet's mannerly and cautious too, </l>
        <l>And neither will abuse himself or you. </l>
        <l>Faith both are needless; since they're done each day, </l>
        <l>By you who judge, and he who writes a Play. </l>
        <l>The sacred thirst for Bayes and Fame is gone, </l>
        <l>And Poetry now turns Extortion. </l>
        <l>Nay worse, Stage-Poetry seduces more </l>
        <l>Than Wine, or Women ever did before. </l>
        <l>Gain'd by its Charms, hither the Wits resort; </l>
        <l>The Stage robs both the Pulpit and the Court. </l>
        <l>The other Sex too are stark rhiming mad, </l>
        <l>Ev'n from the Lady to the Chamber Maid. </l>
        <l>Nor do these Charms in the North Country fail, </l>
        <l>But took our Poet both from Hounds and Ale. </l>
        <l>His Scenes, such as they are, in France are laid; </l>
        <l>Where you may see the ancient English Trade; </l>
        <l>Either in beating France, or giving aid. </l>
        <l>Such vertue reign'd then in our Smiles or frowns, </l>
        <l>Those did defend, as these could conquer Crowns. </l>
        <l>These Miracles were in Eliza's reign </l>
        <l>Whose left hand France and Holland did sustain, </l>
        <l>And whose right hand both baffled Rome and Spain. </l>
        <l>Whilst England only could the World subdue; </l>
        <l>Nay found a new one out, and reign'd there too; </l>
        <l>Iudge then what now <hi>Great Britanny </hi>may do! </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000747-006-b"/>
        <l>Since now her Helm a greater Prince does guide; </l>
        <l>Who has th' advantage of his Sex beside. </l>
        <l>Tho here our Poet rather would make known </l>
        <l>His country's reputation, than his own: </l>
        <l>Yet he may chance by Criticks to be hist, </l>
        <l>As he intrencht upon the Casuist. </l>
        <l>But he no Controversies sets on foot; </l>
        <l>And thinks't were better if none else would do't. </l>
        <l>Nor tells you which Religion he is on; </l>
        <l>May be (like some of you) he is of none. </l>
        <l>If this prove true— He must the Statesman move: </l>
        <l>Then for the Ladies he has Scenes of Love. </l>
        <l>And here, Gallants are fighting Scenes for you: </l>
        <l>Nay here is Huffing for you Hectors too. </l>
        <l>What the Pox, Gentlemen, would you have more? </l>

        <l>Our Eden boasts her Glory and her Aid; </l>
        <l>Not Eden only with your beams you gild; </l>
        <l>But like the Sun-shine upon ev'ry Field. </l>
        <l>'Tis duty then our Lawrels we should bring </l>
        <l>As Offerings to the Pow'r that makes them spring. </l>
        <l>They 'mplore, great Sir, your influence and your aid; </l>
        <l>Lawrels themselves! of Thunder not afraid! </l>
        <l>Were Muses mortal, Halters might 'em fright </l>
        <l>From speaking truth, as some from acting right. </l>
        <l>'Tis vain to fear th' effects of Iesuits rage, </l>
        <l>If You, great Sir, vouchsafe your Patronage. </l>

        <l>At once to guard the Myter and the Crown; </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000747-008-a"/>
        <l>Charls is our Iove, in's Conduct blest we are; </l>
        <l>And Monmouth is his Thunderbolt of War. </l>
        <l>Witness the French at Mastricht, who, with shame, </l>
        <l>Kindled their Valours at his gen'rous Flame. </l>
        <l>You were the ruling Genius of the Field; </l>
        <l>Their empty veins your Spirits only fill'd. </l>
        <l>You taught 'em how to Conquer, rais'd their Name, </l>
        <l>'Twas You advanc't their Trophies, lent 'em Fame; </l>
        <l>Which on a brave Design you did bestow; </l>
        <l>That is, to make them fit to be your Foe. </l>
        <l>Rais'd by your Acts at higher things they aim; </l>
        <l>To follow Monmouth is the Road to Fame. </l>
        <l>Europe, at their successful Arms, amaz'd </l>
        <l>Lookt pale, and all its trembling Princes gaz'd. </l>
        <l>On <hi>Brittain's mighty Monarch </hi>fixt their Eyes, </l>
        <l>Whose greater puissance did 'em more surprize. </l>
        <l>For <hi>English Conquests </hi>swiftly'r might advance; </l>
        <l>Since England more than once had Conquer'd France. </l>
        <l>But then rememb'ring Charls as Iust, as Great, </l>
        <l>His Help, as their last refuge, they intreat. </l>
        <l>Mons is besieg'd and ready to be ta'n! </l>
        <l>Monmouth being absent other hopes were vain. </l>
        <l>At your approach the Gallic flame expires: </l>
        <l>Thus does the Sun put out the weaker Fires. </l>
        <l>Your very Name did weary'd Mons release, </l>
        <l>Made the French fly, and truckle to a Peace; </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000747-008-b"/>
        <l>Swift as the Lightning, and as piercing too! </l>
        <l>Iove thus on's Eagle at the Gyants flew. </l>
        <l>The Ancient Romans did some fear betray </l>
        <l>To pinion Victory, and force her stay: </l>
        <l>She like their Conqu'ring Eagle courts your Hand, </l>
        <l>And will kill surer by your Conduct mann'd. </l>
        <l>What e'r she flies at must your Quarry be; </l>
        <l>Who can resist Monmouth and Victory? </l>
        <l>The fiery Mars is pow'rful in his Sphear, </l>
        <l>Yet loses Virtue when concern'd elsewhere; </l>
        <l>Our Mars a gen'ral influence can afford; </l>
        <l>There is his Sphear, where e'r he draws his Sword. </l>
        <l>In such exploits Caesar was never skill'd, </l>
        <l>First to teach France to Conquer, then to Yield. </l>
        <l>Thus AEolus, with his impetuous Bands, </l>
        <l>Charging the <hi>Lybian Desarts</hi>, drives the Sands </l>
        <l>Into a Mountain, which his Trophy stands. </l>
        <l>'Till changing sides, He rallies in the Air </l>
        <l>His Troops, and then Commands to sound to War: </l>
        <l>The lofty Pageant tumbles to the ground, </l>
        <l>And's Trophy now is in it's ruines found. </l>

        <l>TIs very hard, whilst Fortune was our Foe, </l>
        <l>You should dissert us for her being so. </l>
        <l>We were your Fav'rites; and none before </l>
        <l>Lost that preferment, by their own being poor. </l>
        <l>Small cause, that you should with that Whore conspire, </l>
        <l>To send us Famine, 'cause she sent us Fire. </l>
        <l>The Scenes, compos'd of Oyl and porous Firr, </l>
        <l>Added to th' ruine of the Theater. </l>
        <l>And 'twas a judgement in the Poets Phrase, </l>
        <l>That <hi>Plays and Play-house </hi>perisht by a blaze </l>
        <l>Caus'd by those <hi>gaudy Scenes</hi>, that spoil <hi>good Plays</hi>. </l>
        <l>But why for this should we forsaken be? </l>
        <l>It was our House, alas, was burnt; not we. </l>
        <l>And yet from hence might some suspition come, </l>
        <l>Since it first kindled in our <hi>lowest Room</hi>; </l>
        <l>The Fire did seize on all both <hi>Brick and Wood</hi>; </l>
        <l>But we more lucky were in <hi>Flesh and Blood. </hi>
        </l>
        <l>If we be poor, what then! We're honest tho; </l>
        <l>And that's the thing, we fear, that loses you. </l>
        <l>'Tis not our faults, if our Estates be low, </l>
        <l>But 'twill be yours, if we continue so. </l>
