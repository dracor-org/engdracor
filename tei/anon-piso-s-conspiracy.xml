        <l>IN Plays, it has been a long Practis'd Cheat, </l>
        <l>To make large Bills of Fare, t'aslender Treat. </l>
        <l>So have You seen, a Huge Large Sheet appear </l>
        <l>In Praise o'th' Beauty of Miss-Non-so-Fair: </l>
        <l>But We more Modestly intend t' abuse You; </l>
        <l>Wee'l tell You before-hand how ill Wee'l use You. </l>
        <l>Expect to see a Wond'rous Sight, as rare </l>
        <l>As <hi>Indian Elephant</hi>, or Norwich-Bear. </l>
        <l>Expect grave Strut, big Looks, and thund'ring Speeches, </l>
        <l>From Hero, made up by the Force of Breeches. </l>
        <l>Aye, and a good Sbift too: For, under the Rose, </l>
        <l>Whil'st we look big by Vertue of Our Cloaths, </l>
        <l>And, Hero like, talk what We cannot do, </l>
        <l>We're much such Blusterers as some of You. </l>
        <l>Besides Our Men Players are out of Heart </l>
        <l>Of being seen in an Heroick Part: </l>
        <l>What, with Prince Nick, and t'other House Gallants, </l>
        <l>They have run Hero's out of Countenance? </l>
        <l>We for Heroick's then. 'Tis Our last Plot; </l>
        <l>And Gentlemen, like Us, or like Us not; </l>
        <l>All's one; For Gallants, We have tryed all Arts, </l>
        <l>From a Sir Martin to a Man of Parts, </l>
        <l>And all won't do; therefore We are so hardn'd </l>
        <l>By the Critiques Rage, that past all hopes of Pardon. </l>
        <l>Do well or ill, We are resolved to tease You, </l>
        <l>And 'tis high time when all Our Tricks can't please You. </l>
