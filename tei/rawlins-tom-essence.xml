        <l>WHat! will no warning do?— y'are hardned grown, </l>
        <l>So often Iilted, yet will be Cully'd on? </l>
        <l>'Tis strange— but your good Natures, Sirs, will sway </l>
        <l>Powerful Variety you must obey: </l>
        <l>I thought your last bad Treatment was enough, </l>
        <l>As y'are of Sermons t'ave made ye too Play-proof; </l>
        <l>Yet— mauger all, you will assist the Cheat, </l>
        <l>Tho ye see danger, you'le pursue the feat. </l>
        <l>Like brisk young Fopp that's heated with desire, </l>
        <l>When knowing Miss does subtly fan his fire, </l>
        <l>Tho sure of Clap— yet will he not retire. </l>
        <l>Then take your Chance, the first time 'twill not be, </l>
        <l>If it prove bad, that we have Consend ye; </l>
        <l>Yet we applaud your Curiosity. </l>
        <l>For Gallants, shou'd ye fatally engage </l>
        <l>To keep from hence till Wit returns to th' Stage, </l>
        <l>I fear but few of ye will see that Age. </l>
        <l>Then, since the fault's your own, been't too severe </l>
        <l>On us— your poor and willing Servants here </l>
        <l>For Faith— we treat, </l>
        <l>With all the little Wit that you can spare. </l>

            <p>Mr. Courtly, take my Daughter, and bless ye together, and I hope you'le pardon my intention of Cousening you; I am Old Sir, 'twas for mony, a greater Estate, a greater Estate; and you know we Old men are as amorous on mony as you young Gallants on fair Maids; I'le stand to't, I am Sir, as I say I am. </p>

        <l>NOw I had rather, Sirs, be hang'd, than come </l>
        <l>To know your Curtesies about our Doom: </l>
        <l>Y'ave been apply'd to, all the several ways </l>
        <l>Man's Wit cou'd think of to procure your Praise, </l>
        <l>Yet ne're has any yet successful been, </l>
        <l>To gain your Favours, or Applauses win; </l>
        <l>When monstrous Fools ye have been made o'th'Stage, </l>
        <l>Such provocation justifi'd your Rage. </l>
        <l>We've only now an Essence shewn— poor Man, </l>
        <l>Whose Iealousie was Author of his pain, </l>
        <l>But yet the Fop recover'd Rep again. </l>
        <l>— But now me thinks a Cloak-Cabal I see, </l>
        <l>Whose Prick-ears glow, whilst they their Iealousie </l>
        <l>In Essence find— but Citty-Sirs, I fear, </l>
        <l>Most of You have more cause to be severe: </l>
        <l>We yield you are the truest Character. </l>
        <l>But Tommy Swears by Rep— your Whoring lives </l>
        <l>Are but too bad examples to your Wives. </l>
        <l>If each man to his Dolly wou'd be true, </l>
        <l>Then like my self, your's wou'd be honest too: </l>
        <l>But, Sirs, I Vow it was with much adoe. </l>
