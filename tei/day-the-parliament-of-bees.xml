        <p>I May be thought bold, if not impudent, (upon so little acquaintance) to make this sawcy trespasse upon your patience; But fame, whose office, (like the Nomenclators at Rome) is to to take notice and proclaime the Name and vertues of every Noble Personage, has given you out for so Ingenuous a professor of the Arts, &amp; so bountiful a patron of poor schollars it has imboldned me, to present my Hive of Bees to your favourable protection; and when I remember how Lewis the eleventh (of that Name) King of France tooke notice, &amp; bountifully rewarded a decay'd Gardiner, who presented him with a bunch of Carrets, I doubt not of their kinde and generous entertainment; upon which assurance I rest ever. </p>
