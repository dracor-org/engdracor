        <head>To the Right Honourable ROGER <hi>Earl of </hi>OR RORY, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHat hath introduced the Custom, I cannot tell, whether the extraordinary Favour and Indulgence that Drammatique Poetry hath found amongst persons of the greatest Wit and Honour; or the over-much Confidence of those of our Scribling Tribe, who are willing to assume to our selves the utmost liberty any will give us, or we can with any modesty pretend to; But so it is, that of late, nothing of this kind, though never so inconsiderable, appears in Publique, without some Great and Illustrious Name fixt before it; like a Gigantique Statue at the Portal of <pb xml:id="ep000508-003-a"/>some trirling Building; Whether they design by it, that the mighty Name to whom their little Follies are consecrated, should like the Reliques of Saints, work Miracles on the unbelieving Critiques of our Age, make 'um distrust their own understandings, and have an Implicite Faith in every little Priest of Apollo, I cannot resolve; But since it is grown a Custome, I shall not be so much a Fanatick as not to conform to it; or rather shall approve my self one, in Conforming to a Custome against my Judgement, for interest sake; None of my Fraternity ever having more occasion to creep under the shelter of some Noble Patronage than my self. For, first, <hi>(my Lord</hi>) this unworthy Poem, which I humbly prostrate here at your Lordships feet, was the Off-spring of many confused, raw, indigested and Immature thoughts, pen'd in a crow'd and hurry of business and travel; interrupted and disorder'd by many importunate, not to say insolent affairs, of a quite different nature; and lastly, the first-born of this kind that my thoughts ever laboured with to perfection. And though I will not undertake <pb xml:id="ep000508-003-b"/>here to reflect any thing upon Elder Brothers, whose usual misfortune is (if the observation of some be true) not to inherit all the Wit, as well as all the Estate, but leave that as a thread-bare portion to the Cadels; yet I will be bold to affirm it true in these matters; and I think the experience of all that ever attempted any thing in this kind will second me. The first-born of some most Florid, and after most successful wits, having been so rude and unshapen, as that they have been kept like witless Elder Brothers, out of company, for fear of shaming their Parents. And though others have been more fortunate in their early Productions, yet few but have had those Slips from their Prune, which their riper thoughts either were, or at least had reason to be ashamed of. And now <hi>(my Lord</hi>) I have told you the faults of this Play, give me leave also to tell you the misfortunes of it (for those two commonly go together.) It had the misfortune to be brought into the world in a time, when the Dog-star was near his Reign, and my Judges sat in a hot Bath, rather than a Theatre, and were doubly <pb xml:id="ep000508-004-a"/>persecuted, by the heat of the weather, and the impertinence of the Poet; and which was the worst mishap; when the most candid, as well as the most Illustrious Judges (I mean the Court) were absent, and (excepting the presence of some Great and Noble persons) this unhappy Poem left (for the most part) to the mercy of a common Audience; in which unguarded condition it might well expect to receive some wounds, and so it did; though much fewer than either I expected, yet such, as it deserved; whether it will survive or no, I know not, nor am concerned at; if it will not, then it gives me good occasion to Apologize for this Dedcaition, and to tell <hi>your Lordship</hi>, that it receiving its first Life and Being in the World from <hi>your Lordships </hi>favour, and now dying in the corporeal part of it, <hi>(I </hi>mean the action) the Spiritual and Surviving part of it, ought like its Parent the Soul, <hi>to return to him that gave it. </hi>And if I may have leave from our rigid Religionists, to prosecute the Metaphor, as in that abstracted State, the Soul is infinitely more happy han in any it could attain to whilst immersed in flesh &amp; blood; so <hi>(my Lord</hi>) to have any the least residence in <pb xml:id="ep000508-004-b"/>
          <hi>your Lordships </hi>thoughts, will be a state of more felicity and honour, than any this Poem, whilst embodied in action, could arrive to by the private or general Applause of the Wits of the World. But now I am fallen upon the consideration of <hi>your Lordship, I </hi>am plunged methinks into a vast Ocean, where I have nothing to determinate my sight, but a bright and Serene Sky full of light, at a vast distance from me, and as vast a height above me, and no shore but that from whence I came, and to which I must retire again, to take a safe and pleasant prospect of that which I can neither fathom, nor describe. It is indeed the common practice of Dedications, to stuff their Epistles full of Panegyricks, not perhaps so much to describe their Patrons, who sometimes are as obscure as themselves, as to shew their own skill in writing Characters and Essayes: But the case is not the same with me; and what may be tolerable enough with them, would be absurd in me; and I should fall into the impertinence of those that would write large Encomiums on the Sun, who certainly commends himself to us by his own light and influence, much better than any man can do by his wit. Not so say any thing <pb xml:id="ep000508-005-a"/>
          <hi>(my Lord</hi>) of the Souldier, and Statesman in you, which have rendred you both Known and Famous to all the valiant and politique part of Mankind; that of your Poetry is a large Theme, in which perhaps I could expatiate with more success than on any of the former; yet I shall not dare to do it for want of Art; and if I could take <hi>your Lordships </hi>heighth, I should but discover the vast distance I am scituate in from so bright an Orb; as Navigators that take the heighth of the Sun, only to find what Degree of Latitude themselves are in. If there be any part of the World so obscure as not to have heard <hi>your Lordships </hi>Fame in that, as well as other respects, I shall refer them to a Character of <hi>your Lordship</hi>; not to the praises and applauses of the world in general, nor the Panegyricks of lesser Pens, which have alwayes waited on the Tryumphs of yours, as the common Souldiers in the <hi>Roman Tryumphs did on their Generals</hi>; but to the incomparable issues of your own thoughts, wherein they will see not only a Character of <hi>your Lordship</hi>, but of the present improv'd Genius of England, which by the assistance of <hi>your Lordship</hi>, and many Sublime Wits in other Arts, begins to be as famous in <pb xml:id="ep000508-005-b"/>Arts, <hi>as formerly it was in Arms</hi>; witnesse those new Academies and Societies Erected amongstus for <hi>Philosophical Commerce</hi>, and the improvement of <hi>Language, Wit, and Arts</hi>; Commodities which Forreigne Vertuosoes would have engrossed to themselves, and till of late denyed to be the native growth of this (now in all respects) most happy, and most fertile Island. It is from <hi>your Lordships </hi>Pen, that Solyman may be truly stiled Magnificent, and you have made him succeed to the Civility and Gallantry of the Greeks, as well as to their Empire; nor was Mustapha ever so much the hopes of his <hi>Barbarous Nation</hi>, as in his Image and the generous Character you have given him, <hi>he is the delight of England, </hi>who weep the Fate, not of Mustapha, but of Murder'd Vertue. And indeed what Pen but <hi>your Lordships </hi>could have refined and softned a Story so Barbarous, and made a people so remote from Friendship, Honour, and Religion, walk disguised in the Highest Characters of them all? It is <hi>your Lordships </hi>Pen that hath assisted Henry the fifth in a second conquest of France, and in the noblest Characters of Valour, Love, and Friendship, hath made the English Wit and Language as tryumphant as <pb xml:id="ep000508-006-a"/>their Arms: nor could a story acted with so much glory and success, be attempted by any Pen beneath <hi>your Lordship's</hi>. In fine, it is <hi>your Lordship </hi>that hath Charmed up the Ghosts of many Noble Heroes, who otherwise would have lain unlamented in their Tombs; And they have walked on the Stage in Brighter Shapes than ever they lived, and have been conducted to their Fates, with more sorrow of the Spectators, then perhaps they had when they dyed. And all this <hi>your Lordship </hi>hath done, not in the pleasure of Shade, Ease, and Retirement, and with the Advantages and Assistances that meaner Spirits are forced to make use of for their Compositions; but they are only the Sallyes of your Pen, and that during the uneasie intervals which pain sometimes borrows from State Affairs; and what a fit of the Gout snatches from the use and benefit, <hi>your Lordship </hi>takes care to employ to the delight and pleasure of the World; and if <hi>your Lordship </hi>can do all this, upon the rack of pain, and with some glances of your thoughts, whil'st the rest like scattered Rayes of Light, are dispersed on various Objects; what would you do with all the Freedom and Ease of other men, and with the united <pb xml:id="ep000508-006-b"/>force of your Soul? But I am sinking again out of my depth, and must retreat once more to that shore from whence I am insensibly wandred; I mean <hi>(my Lord</hi>) to the consideration of my self, and of this worthless Present which I make to <hi>your Lordship</hi>: Which <hi>(my Lord</hi>) I cannot but look with much contempt upon, as being conscious to my self, in what hast and confusion it was composed, and of what ex-tempore thoughts the greatest part of it consists: Nor should I have presumed to have usher'd it into the world, under so great a Patronage, had not I first obtained your leave. And now I hope <hi>your Lordship</hi>, that at the hearing of it whil'st it was in loose sheets, was pleased to forgive the faults of the Poem, will now in this address pardon those of the Author, whose chief design is not to gain the name of Poet, Author, Wit, or Critick, but that of </p>

        <l>So you good Wits, and you that would be so, </l>
        <l>You all together make a pretty show; </l>
        <l>And when you thus in general Councel sit, </l>
        <l>You are the body Politick of Wit: </l>
        <l>Vnto you all our Poet bid me say, </l>
        <l>Good faith you'r kindly welcome to his Play. </l>
        <l>'Tis a plain Complement, to speak the truth, </l>
        <l>But you must know he is a modest youth; </l>
        <l>Like Country Gallant just, whom Courtier brings </l>
        <l>To see fine dainty Mis— who playes and sings. </l>
        <l>Approaching to'r, poor Gallant falls a mumping, </l>
        <l>Scraping o' leggs, and feign he would say something; </l>
        <l>And round about the room he slings and skips, </l>
        <l>Whil'st tongue lyes still i'th' scabbard of his lips. </l>
        <l>Just so our Poet usher'd to the door </l>
        <l>To court coy Wits h'ad never seen before, </l>
        <l>Wits that have all the sparkish Gallants known, </l>
        <l>And tryed th' abilities of all the Town; </l>
        <l>Poor bashful Poet, faith, h'ad got his Play </l>
        <l>Vnder his arm, and had run quite away, </l>
        <l>Had not we promis'd him to use our skill </l>
        <l>And in'trest w'e'e to gain him your good will: </l>
        <l>Then faith for once, since he's so eager for't, </l>
        <l>Seem kind and coming, though it be for sport; </l>
        <l>Then like some Cully on his wedding night, </l>
        <l>Thinking his Bride lyes ravisht with delight, </l>
        <l>Bestirs his simple self whil'st she lies still, </l>
        <l>Laughs at the Fool, and lets him work his will. </l>
        <l>So will our Poet to't, and work his brain </l>
        <l>To try to entertain you once again; </l>
        <l>And if he mends, you that delight to range </l>
        <l>With every Youth, may use him then for chang; </l>
        <l>If not, e'en huff the Fool, and give him o're, </l>
        <l>Then he perhaps will trouble you no more. </l>
