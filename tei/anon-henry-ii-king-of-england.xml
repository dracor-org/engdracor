        <head>To the Truly Worthy Sir <hi>THOMAS COOKE </hi>Kt. <hi>Alderman, and Sheriff of the Most Famous City of </hi>LONDON. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THough a Stranger to your Person, 'tis impossible to be so to your Virtues; for General Fame (that is so often call'd a Lyar, and seldom takes pains to Blazon Good Deeds, but on the c√≥ntrary is most industrious to expose the Bad) has taken an unusual and peculiar Care to Justify your Reputation; And the united consent of all Mankind concur, that in your Character she has spoke Truth, and what is as commendable, no more than the Truth. </p>
        <p>Your Generous Charity in many considerable Extremities, has sufficiently demonstrated, not only the Ancient Spirit of an English Man, but the more glorious Principle of a Christian. Charity the eldest Favourite of God, the first in Honour, and the last in Love, seems to be declared the Heir of all your Fortunes: It is your Private Pleasure, your Secret Ambition, the Care of your Endeavours, and I cannot help saying, the Blessing that attends 'em. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000472-003-a"/>
        <p>Your Noble Commiseration on the Deplorable Condition of many a wretched Soul in the Hard Frost must be remembred, when Corn and Goals were above their reach, and, indeed, so dear, that it would have been counted Impudence, in the greatest necessity, to have begg'd 'em; You, like a second Ioseph, in the Famine, reliev'd their wants, and gave 'em Fire to warm the Hearts you fed. </p>
        <p>Your most Commendable Bounty to the distressed Irish Protestants must be remembred, for you were their greatest Benefactor, and the First. Such Publick Benevolence ought not to be conceal'd, tho' 'tis your desire; for you would be as well pleas'd to have it not known, as you are satisfied when you bestow it: But I say again, it ought to be Publish'd out of the hopes that the knowledge of such Goodness may rouze the sleeping hospitality of our Land, that it may take place of Board Wages, which has scandalously shut up those Doors our Grandfathers always kept open for the Poor. </p>
        <p>It is not to be expected that my Pen should set forth your Praise as the merit of it deserves, but as the famous Sir <hi>Godfrey Kneller</hi>, in a Choice Picture will strike the Eye of the Beholder (tho' a Stranger to the Original) and tell him, some where or other he has seen that Face, tho' he cannot immediately recollect the Person: So I will endeavour by the bold touches of Truth, to let the World know they have heard of the Man, tho' they cannot at the instant apply the Character to his Name. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000472-003-b"/>
        <p>So Famous a Citizen has not in many Ages fill'd the Walls of London; your Generosity is the Honour of it, your Conduct and Affability the Credit of it; And you are one of the chiefest Members in the support of its Trade. </p>
        <p>'Tis probable that the World may admire at a Dedication of this Nature to Sir <hi>Thomas Cooke</hi>, since the Custom of Poets has been to Address their Plays to the Nobility, either by the way of Thanks, for Patronizing their Works before they were made publick; or else in a Panegyrick on their Families: But I declare, neither of these are the occasion of this Epistle; but that it proceeds from a real respect I have to your great Character, and a desire of being the first that should Publish it to the World. </p>
        <p>The Romans whose Courage and Country once excell'd all others, were ever proudest of their Citizens, and not without good Reason; for indeed they are the support of all Governments: And as they are the first to be Tryed, so they are the longest to be Esteem'd, the most to be Encouraged, and the last to be Injured. Anthony reckon'd he had as good as Conquer'd Brutus, when his Oration had overthrown his Interest with the Citizens. That ours may always Flourish, and never want such Virtues as yours to advance their Prosperity, shall be the constant and fervant wish, </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>IN this grave Age, improv'd by States-mens Art, </l>
          <l>Who e'er can think you'll like a Misses Part? </l>
          <l>Time was, when Rosamond might shine at Court; </l>
          <l>These are no days for Ladies of that sort. </l>
          <l>How strangely Time does Human Things decay! </l>
          <l>Four Cent'ries past, as ancient Writers say, </l>
          <l>She that we represent bore mighty sway: </l>
          <l>Her Beauty wondred at, her Wit extoll'd, </l>
          <l>Her yellow Locks were call'd too <hi>Threads of Gold. </hi>
          </l>
          <l>But now should that Complexion use the Trade, </l>
          <l>Each puny Fop the Town has newly made, </l>
          <l>Would cry, <hi>Confound the Carrot-pated Jade</hi>. </l>
          <l>Misses in times of War and Ieopardy, </l>
          <l>Like Armourers in days of Peace must be; </l>
          <l>His Swords and Helmets rust, and so will She. </l>
          <l>What sort of Criticks then must I endear </l>
          <l>To favour this abandon'd Character? </l>
          <l>The French fatigue too much, to mind Amour; </l>
          <l>Th' Italian's Bigotted; The Spaniard Poor; </l>
          <l>The <hi>Clumsie Lover</hi>, with his <hi>Northern Sense</hi>, </l>
          <l>Would have the Yo-Frows, but would spare the Pence: </l>
          <l>Rav'nous of Beauty; But when Purse should open, </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Myn Heer </hi>is either deaf, or Drunk-aslopen. </l>
          <l>Thus all o'er Europe, as the Scenes are laid, </l>
          <l>War and Religion have quite spoil'd Love's Trade. </l>
          <l>Since then from Courts her Part must hope no pity, </l>
          <l>I'll try ths <hi>English Lovers </hi>of the City; </l>
          <l>Kind Souls, who many a Night o'er Toast and Ale, </l>
          <l>Have wept at reading Rosamond's fam'd Tale, </l>
          <l>And will, we hope for Beauties sake, to day </l>
          <l>Confront the Wits, and save a harmless Play. </l>
          <l>So may you thrive, your Wagers all be won; </l>
          <l>So may your Wise Stock-jobbing Crimp go on; </l>
          <l>So may your Ships return from the Canaries, </l>
          <l>And stoln French Cargoes in your <hi>Johns and Maries</hi>. </l>
          <l>Stand Buff once for a Mistress: Think what Lives </l>
          <l>Some of you daily lead with scolding Wives. </l>
          <l>And though she fell by Iealous Cruelty, </l>
          <l>For Venial Sin 'twas pity she should die. </l>
          <l>Ah! should your Wives and Daughters so be try'd, </l>
          <l>And with her Dose their Failings purify'd, </l>
          <l>Lord! What a Massacre wou'd mawl Cheapside! </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <stage xml:id="ep000472-e1050">Written by Mr. Dryden. Spoke by Mrs. Bracegirdle. </stage>
        <lg>
          <l>THus you the sad Catastrophe have seen, </l>
          <l>Occasion'd by a Mistress and a Queen. </l>
          <l>Queen Eleanor the Proud was French, they say; </l>
          <l>But English Manufacture got the Day: </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Jane Clifford </hi>was her Name, as Books aver, </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Fair Rosamond </hi>was but her <hi>Nom de Guerre</hi>. </l>
          <l>Now tell me, Gallants, wou'd you lead your Life </l>
          <l>With such a Mistress, or with such a Wife? </l>
          <l>If One must be your Choice, which d'ye approve, </l>
          <l>The Curtain-Lecture, or the Curtain-Love? </l>
          <l>Wou'd ye be Godly with perpetual Strife, </l>
          <l>Still drudging on with homely Joan your Wife; </l>
          <l>Or take your Pleasure in a wicked way, </l>
          <l>Like honest Whoring Harry in the Play? </l>
          <l>I guess your minds: The Mistress wou'd be taking, </l>
          <l>And nauseous Matrimony sent a packing. </l>
          <l>The Devil's in ye all; Mankind's a Rogue, </l>
          <l>You love the Bride, but you detest the Clog: </l>
          <l>After a Year, poor Spouse is left i'th' lurch; </l>
          <l>And you, like Haynes, return to Mother-Church. </l>
          <l>Or, if the name of Church comes cross your mind, </l>
          <l>Chappels of Ease behind our Scenes you find: </l>
          <l>The Play-house is a kind of Market-place; </l>
          <l>One chaffers for a Voice, another for a Face. </l>
          <l>Nay, some of you, I dare not say how many, </l>
          <l>Would buy of me a Pen'worth for your Peny. </l>
          <l>Ev'n this poor Face (which with my Fan I hide) </l>
          <l>Would make a shift my Portion to provide, </l>
          <l>With some small Perquisites I have beside. </l>
          <l>Though for your Love, perhaps, I should not care, </l>
          <l>I could not hate a Man that bids me fair. </l>
          <l>What might ensue, 'tis hard for me to tell; </l>
          <l>But I was drench'd to day for loving well, </l>
          <l>And fear the Poyson that would make me swell. </l>

This Reverend Abbot has engag'd me in a fine bus'ness. When Rosamond told me in Confession of the King's Address to her, and I acquainted his Lordship with it, he oblig'd me to persuade her she ought not to resist the Importunities of her Prince, lest her Obstinacy should occasion his Death, and Royal Murther was a dreadful thing: But what's the reason of his making me tell the Queen of it? He says 'tis to revenge our Patron Becket: I know not what it may come to; he has promis'd me Preferment, and my Conscience must submit to my Ambition.‚Äî Oh she's here.‚Äî How shall I deliver my self?‚Äî I'm a cursed Orator.‚Äî I'll put some hard words together, which will sound like Rhetorick, and that may pass for Learning if she understands 'em not.‚Äî Hail, Sacred Majesty. </p>
