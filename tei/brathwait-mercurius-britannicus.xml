Thou shalt find althings saleable in Troinovant; the dainty dames will untie thy purse strings with a busse: out goes the husband, in comes the friend; hah, hah, hah. Thou shalt finde some that resigne their offices least they should loose them; others leaving their nest, that thy and their young may not perish, others that abounded through rapine miserably exhausted; others adorned with others feathers, that have cast their owne. Here thou shalt see Coblers and hucksters that rise out of old shooes and panniers, beating the Pulpit, and broaching new doctrines, as if they were Regij Professores, and held by the rable to be most profound Divinity: yea, I cannot wash my hands but me thinkes I see the soapy effigies of Brunfield in the Bason: nor can I goe downe into a celler, but I finde the lively statue of Master Abell; yea I cannot, untie my shooe, but I call to minde that patent for Leather and deride it; For men now truely seeme turned into trees bringing forth spatious branches, but fruits of vanity: in a word all the world is full of fooles, and ridiculous in the eyes of Democritus. </p>

But to proud men no burthen is more dangerous then honour: they so easily change their conditions, that they wil not know their friends and acquaintance. These tumours of the world prick on their mindes with such a strange kind of fury, that they make themselves hated by their familiers and others: wherefore an office is best aquired by a Magistrate; nor is it better bestowed on any then on him who seekes it not at all, or very coldly. This he well advised who said: let it bee given to him that denies it, and denyed to him that excepts it. But long let this Chrysomitris nest in a forreigne nation before hee be recalled.

Him you had for an example; but (although your steps were Curva vestigia) refusing to follow Curvus, you have turned the right into oblique, you know you well knew (to the aggravation of your censure, those golden sentences of Periander, most worthy your memory, that nothing must be done for moneys sake, and that favour is an enemy to Iudgement.

Nor did Ioachimus lately deceased deserve any lesse; but by paying his debt to nature, the destinies have made him their perpetuall debtor.

            <p>Stand forth, stand forth, Sir Iudges of a miserable condition. You have not denyed but that you are guilty of the crime for which you are indited; Nor can you produce any defence of your desperate cause, which is worthy our hearing: you know, you wel know that a Iudg is to be iudged in none of those things, which he is provided to iudge in another. In which, I say, how wretchedly have you erred? For you were Iudges, &amp; censurers of the selfe same crime, whereof you were the Authors. For a Iudge to take a bribe, was a capitall thing; But if so great &amp; so heavy a sentence was pronounced for one fault, &amp; that extending but to a particular subiect, what punishment must be inflicted on them, who have beene so iniurous to the subiects, of a whole flourishing Iland; by making the Prince suspicious of his subiects: the Subiects of their Prince; by declaring new opinions against the evident testimonys of their consciences; by perturbing the Halcyon days of a peacefull king, &amp; an obedient state; yea by bringing all according to their power, into flames and ashes; If such a fire whereof you were the true Incendiarys, do not deserve death, what it better deserveth I cannot tell. The law was first ordained to be a publike benefit; but by you it <pb xml:id="eng000364-015-b"/>is made the very plague of the common weale; You have all very well acted the part of Midas: Being Commissaryes of trust between Prince &amp; people, which you should not violate for threatnings, friends, entreaties nor rewards; you being intised by the bayle of avarice, or strucken with a Panick feare, have left Iustice naked; &amp; wretchedly neglected your consciences, which testified against you. And so through lucre or terrour, being blinded in your understanding, you have provided your selves true ministers of Midas. </p>

            <p>Observe &amp; heare what I shall say: I beleeve that in leasure houres, you have read how the Germanes having been rather conquered then subiect by their good leading of Drusus, assoone as hee was dead, trusting upon their strength began to hate the lust &amp; insolence of varus Quinctilius, and how easily they became victors. Which short conflict being ended, like Barbarians as they were, they shewed themselves most savage, &amp; tirranous conquerours: Nor in that extreame cruelty, did they shew themselves more implacable towards any condition, then to men of the coÌsulare dignity, thinking that through their eloquent &amp; vendible tongues, the Romanes had first beleagued them, &amp; brought them to that calamity. Varus prosecuts them with the same mind &amp; fate of Paulus at Cannae, never was greater slaughter in fields &amp; woods, never more intolerable insultatioÌ, <pb xml:id="eng000364-016-a"/>but especially towards those that pleaded causes. Some of their eyes pulled out, others hands cut off, one's mouth they sewed up, first cutting out his tongue, which a Barbarian holding in his hand said, at length; viper desist from hissing, you should likewise call to mind Manius Acilius; that unsatisfied gulfe of briberie, &amp; principall Embassadour of the Romans, whom Mithridates with great contempt, compelled to ride upon an asse, untill he came unto Pergamus, where he commanded Elixar of gold to be thrust into his mouth, intimating that the Romans were to much given to briberys, &amp; had tongues, too eloquent in evil speaking. Alexander Severus the greatest enemy of flatterers, commanded that Turinus one of his courtiers; should bee tyed to a stake in the market place, and smother'd to death with smoke, having a cryer proclaiming by him. Let him perish with smoke, that sold smoke: For it is better (to use Antisthenes words) to fall amongst crowes, then Parasites; amongst crowes to be devoured dead, then amongst Parasites to be devoured living. Therfore it wil be an argument of wisdome, for us to deale with you, who hath brought such plagues upon the common-weale, &amp; disturbed our peace by your slanderous iudgements, as Philip King of Macedon, did with two of his subiects, men of vile conditions; he commanded one to fly from Macedon, &amp; the other to follow him, which being done, his country was purged of such noxious sicophants: both departed but neitheir of them returned. </p>

But chiefely wee will, that you command Francis Helioke, henceforth to distinguish that Apochryphall name of Bishop, with an asteriske, amongst the obsolete words to perpetuall remembrance. But as for the first Article of our complaint; as we would have no order in the church, so (to come unto the 2. we abhorre all rites and ceremonys; because whatsoever is ancient we iudge to be untrue, we disallow Priestly ornaments as well in the Presbytery, as lawne sleeves in a Bishop; we esteeme the Surplesse as the smocke of the whore of Babylon, and the cope as Aegyptian <pb xml:id="eng000364-017-b"/>embroydery: These Idolatrous Priests in their linnen appeare to us like Ghosts comming out of a Church yard.
