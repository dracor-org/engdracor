        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>So ill success have Poets now adaies, </l>
        <l>That shortly none will dare to write you Plays. </l>
        <l>Dramatick Wit is ominous of late; </l>
        <l>The little Flash does still prognosticate </l>
        <l>A Paper-war, or a more scurvie Fate. </l>
        <l>And (like a graceless Child) <hi>Heroick Rattle </hi>
        </l>
        <l>Is realliz'd, and turn'd the Poets Battle. </l>
        <l>T'avoid such fears, we shall present to day </l>
        <l>An innocent and unprovoking Play: </l>
        <l>And that's his comfort, th'Author bid me say. </l>
        <l>'Tis plain, well meant; hardly a Song or Dance, </l>
        <l>Scene, nor Machine, its Credit to advance. </l>
        <l>Yo've nothing here of such prodigious strains, </l>
        <l>To swell your Envie greater than his Pains. </l>
        <l>But being of English growth, we've cause to fear, </l>
        <l>'Gainst home-bred Wit their censure too severe, </l>
        <l>Who still usurp a Power to disapprove </l>
        <l>What the sick Fancie can't digest, or Love. </l>
        <l>Persist&#8212; But Letchers thus, when they decline, </l>
        <l>Borrow both Heat and Love from sparkling Wine. </l>
        <l>And though poor Chloris thinks their Love's her Prize, </l>
        <l>'Tis Burgundy becomes her Sacrifice. </l>
        <l>While healthful Lovers vigorously improve </l>
        <l>With Native Food and heat th'Entrigues of Love. </l>

She is a good Soul (as Sancho said of his Wife) but of a downright Country-principle. She hates your City here, and all that belongs to't. Looke ye, Iack; when you left the Colledge, I would have follow'd you with all my heart, but my Mother very gravely, and like a Mother, writ me her Commands, and I think, sent one of her servants to acquaint me, that I must still continue my Studies where I was: for to come into the Country, and enter into Commission of the Peace, I was yet too young; and to go to the Inns a Court she would never think on't, for that was the ready way to be undone, London being the very sink of all Debauchery. </p>

You must know then, in an evil hour, I owe him 6000 l. which my Father heretofore borrow'd, partly to marry a Daughter, and partly on other occasions: For this Debt he mortgaged five hundred a year, which Mortgage has been now forfeited about four year, and he in the Devils name, has enter'd. Since my Father's death, Ned, I have been very sensible of this loss, it being (betwixt you and I) the best half of my Estate. In fine, I have been several times with him to take in this Mortgage, and get him to release the Estate. I have offer'd him, to that end, to pay down 3000 l. with the Interest due, and a Judgment from my self and two substantial Citizens, for the other three. </p>

Her Father dying, left this his onely Daughter, and 6000 l. to the management of his Wives Brother, this Docket, who he appointed her Guardian, with this Proviso in his Will, that if she married without her said Guardian's consent, then to forfeit the said sum intended for her Portion, and that her Uncle might dispose of it as he thought fit. Her Uncle, a covetous Jew, has swallow'd all this Estate already in imagination, intending never to marry her with his consent: To that end, confines her (while with him in London) constantly to her Chamber, never suffering her to see the open air, unless once or twice a fortnight in the Temple or Lincolns-Inn-Gardens; and that too, with himself or some such trusty Governour. </p>

              <p>Nay, Spruce, there you are again a t'other side: I wou'd not have ye think there's any harm in <hi>Robert Wiseman's </hi>Psalms, nor in the old Song of <hi>Chevie Chace</hi>, but that they may be both used, and very innocently. And more than so, I believe there are some Volumes of Meeter that are very convenient, and of great use in a Lawyer's Study, as <hi>The Garland of Good will, The furious fight of Floddon-field, </hi>and all Mr. Wither's his Works; all these I believe Dashwel has, and need not be ashamed of 'em. Nay, I can very well remember, when I first learnt Court-hand I had all the Ballat of the <hi>Two little Children </hi>by heart, and me thought it was so comfortable. But that which ought to be odious to the understanding of all true Clerks, is your modern Poetry, your new fashion or modish Poetry, your Play-Poetry, or Dramatick Meeter, your ranting and tearing Poetry, your Poetry that breaks windows, or, as they themselves call it, your Heroick Poetry.&#8212; <stage xml:id="ep000787-e24350">(Knocking without. </stage>Spruce, see who's at door. </p>

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>THe plague of Writing has infected all; </l>
        <l>'Tis a Disease grown epidemical, </l>
        <l>And not confin'd to th' bounds of this lewd Town, </l>
        <l>But o're the Nation the Infection's slown. </l>
        <l>For Country-Squires now drunken Catches write, </l>
        <l>Whilst Miss is here lampoon'd by Iilted Knight. </l>
        <l>The brisk gay Fop, and modest Lover too, </l>
        <l>With senseless Rimes coy Mistrisses persue. </l>
        <l>Nay, the great man, Heir to more Wealth than Wit, </l>
        <l>From Authors steals, yet swears those lines he writ: </l>
        <l>But he (suspecting you the cheat shou'd finde) </l>
        <l>Both to himself, and world, will prove so kinde </l>
        <l>To let you know in Verse a piece of's minde. </l>
        <l>Then blundring through the streams of Poetric </l>
        <l>He knowingly displays Debaucherie, </l>
        <l>Which proves to be his own Epitomie. </l>
        <l>The Zealot too, (as I'm inform'd) through th' Nose </l>
        <l>Pronounc'd a fatal Sentence against Prose: </l>
        <l>For being inspir'd with Brother Hopkins Rime, </l>
        <l>He wooes a Sister in the like jangling Chime. </l>
        <l>Nay, shou'd w'enquire, no doubt there are but few </l>
        <l>Amongst ye here, but what are Dablers too; </l>
        <l>And Muse as well as Miss for kindness sue. </l>
        <l>It is the worlds blinde side&#8212; then, Sirs, forbear </l>
        <l>Your censures now, lest fondly ye appear, </l>
        <l>Not to our Author, but t'your selves severe. </l>
        <l>Though plain, 'tis new, your Rigour then suspend, </l>
        <l>Since to divert you this he did intend. </l>
        <l>If all should write alike, then where wou'd be </l>
        <l>Your blest Diana, sweet Varietie? </l>
        <trailer>FINIS. </trailer>
