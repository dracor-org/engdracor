          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>MY happy success in one bold Attempt, not only encourages but forces me to a much greater, aspiring to lay this Triffle at your Royal Highness's Feet; when a Woman appears in the World under any distinguishing Character, she must expect to be the mark of ill Nature, but most one who seems desirous to recommend her self by what the other Sex think their peculiar Prerogative. This, Madam, makes me fly to the Protection of so great a Princess, though I am sensible so high an Honour must raise me many more Enemies, making me indeed worthy of Envy, which I am but too well secur'd from in my self (though an undertaking so few of my Sex, have ventur'd at, may draw some Malice on me) but 'tis my happiness that the thing which will most reasonably make me the object of Enmity, will be my safety against the effects of it. What insolence dare injure one they find in your Royal Presence, and under your Illustrious Patronage? </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000489-003-a"/>
        <p>Nor need your Highness disdain to look Favourably down upon this humble Present; though I have hitherto seem'd to offer it only for my own security, I may say it in some measure merits your regard, though the performance much unworthy of it, its End is the most noble, to discourage Vice, and recommend a firm unshaken Virtue; that must receive your Royal Highnesses Approbation, since 'tis the same Great design as that of your own Admirable Life, but with what disadvantage imitated! how must I Blush for the Copy when I cast my Eyes upon such an Excellent Original! </p>
        <p>But here permit me, Madam, to decline attempting your Encomium, as a mark both of the most profound respect, and highest Admiration, best express'd by an awful silence, which confesses you above all Praise; but were it possible for some Nobler Pen to reach the height of your Perfections, the Work wou'd be Superfluous, since they need not ev'n the Lustre of your Rank to make 'em conspicuous to the World, or to engage Mankind in your Service; nor be offended, most Illustrious Princess, if I say, 'tis they more even than your Royal Birth, make me Ambitious with all Submissive Duty, to be allowed the Title of </p>

        <l>GReat Sappho, with some few that shar'd her Glory, </l>
        <l>Kept the bright Character they had in Story, </l>
        <l>With doubted right; till after-ages came; </l>
        <l>By fair examples to assert their Fame: </l>
        <l>As when the tribute of our praise we give, </l>
        <l>They by your worth to endless Fame Survive: </l>
        <l>Nor can I silently my thoughts delay, </l>
        <l>The joys too exquisite, and will have way; </l>
        <l>Tho' greatest Beauties, less in praise appear, </l>
        <l>'Tis hard, to see, be charm'd, and not cry out she's Fair: </l>
        <l>Your Play with an exalted Genius shines, </l>
        <l>And charming numbers every thought refines; </l>
        <l>But sure thy mind was meant the Court of Love, </l>
        <l>Soft as the joys that yeilding Virgins move; </l>
        <l>There every Grace does to thy Pen repair, </l>
        <l>Firing the Brave, melting the rigid Fair; </l>
        <l>Nor less in Honour's School hast thou been read, </l>
        <l>Thy Men with equal steps, the tract of glory tread; </l>
        <l>As when some Master-Hand a Cupid draws, </l>
        <l>With pointed Arrow in a Lovers cause; </l>
        <l>On th' other side a Mars with many grace, </l>
        <l>Expressing right and Victory in his Face; </l>

        <l>The sporting Fair who now despis'd his art, </l>

        <l>Who for inglorious ease could Fame forego, </l>
        <l>Rouz'd at the sight starts forward to the Foe: </l>
        <l>Nor does thy rules for Life alone excel, </l>
        <l>You've taught the harder task of dying well; </l>
        <l>Safe from the gingling folly of our time, </l>
        <l>Whose Heroes die in simile and rhyme </l>
        <l>'Tis thus you may support the sinking Stage, </l>
        <l>Thus learn the Scriblers that infect this Age; </l>
        <l>To Mourn how Nature stinted their poor lot </l>
        <l>And leave for humbler arts their Plays and Plot: </l>
        <l>Let <hi>Congreve, Granvile</hi>, and the few who yet, </l>
        <l>Support the credit of our Poets Wit; </l>
        <l>With you the Empire of the Stage maintain, </l>
        <l>Nor suffer Fools so oft t' usurp your reign; </l>
        <l>Then perfect Plays would perfect joys inspire, </l>
        <l>Touch to the Soul, and waken dead desire: </l>
        <l>Deny each chatt'ring Ape his fancy'd part, </l>
        <l>And teach us to revere your Sacred Art. </l>

        <head>To my much Esteemed Friend On her PLAY call'd FATAL-FRIENDSHIP. </head>
        <l>WIth what Concern I sat and heard your Play, </l>
        <l>None else can Iudge, but such a Friend sure may. </l>
        <l>The Indian Mother cou'd not feel more pain, </l>
        <l>Whose Newborn Babe's thrown headlong in the Main, </l>
        <l>To prove him lawful: at whose welcome Rise </l>
        <l>(Her fears disperst) Ioy gushes at her Eyes. </l>
        <l>Were I but Iudge enough I'd do thee Right, </l>
        <l>Though yet much more, I want Poetick flight, </l>
        <l>And 'twere his folly to repeat a new </l>
        <l>Who light a Taper the bright Sun to shew, </l>
        <l>Shou'd I attempt your Praise, but as a Friend, </l>
        <l>T' Express my thoughts, is all that I Intend. </l>
        <l>Your fable's clear, no rule you have transgrest, </l>
        <l>Chast all your thoughts, yet Nature still exprest, </l>
        <l>Your numbers flow, as if the Muses all </l>
        <l>Consulted nothing, but their Rise, and fall, </l>
        <l>Your Characters are just, and with such art </l>
        <l>Your Passions rais'd, they gain th' unwary heart, </l>
        <l>And what you feign, effectually Create, </l>
        <l>Who was unmov'd, at sad Felicia's Fate? </l>
        <l>Scarce cou'd the stubbornest deny their Tears, </l>
        <l>All felt your Heroes miseries, as theirs, </l>
        <l>But as a faithful Friend, he touch'd me most; </l>
        <l>By life's most noble, best of blessings, lost; </l>
        <l>O Heaven, this my fondest wish Decree! </l>
        <l>Our mutual Friendship, may ne'er Fatal be. </l>

        <l>More Iust Applause is yours who check the Rage, </l>
        <l>Of Reigning Vice, that has debauch'd the Stage, </l>
        <l>And dare shew Vertue in a vicious Age; </l>
        <l>With Eager wishing Eyes the Day we sought, </l>
        <l>When to its first Design the Dramma might be brought, </l>
        <l>Now an unusual Charm our Hearts has seiz'd, </l>
        <l>For we at once both profit, and are pleas'd; </l>
        <l>And you may boast, that by your skillful Hand, </l>
        <l>You've done what Senates did in Vain Command: </l>

        <head>To the Ingenious AUTHOR, ON HER Tragedy, call'd <hi>Fatal Friendship</hi>. Sent by an Unknown Hand. </head>
        <l>AS when Camilla once, a Warlike Dame </l>
        <l>In bloody Battles won immortal Fame; </l>
        <l>Forsook her Female Arts, and chose to bear </l>
        <l>The pondrous Shield, and heave the massy Spear, </l>
        <l>Superiour to her Sex; so swift she flew </l>
        <l>Around the Field, and such vast Numbers slew, </l>
        <l>That Friends and Foes alike surpriz'd behold </l>
        <l>The brave Virago desperately Bold, </l>
        <l>And thought her Pallas in a human Mold. </l>
        <l>Such is our Wonder, matchless Maid! to see </l>
        <l>The Tragick Laurel thus deserv'd by thee. </l>
        <l>Yet greater Praise is yours; Camilla shines </l>
        <l>For ever bright in Virgil's Sacred Lines, </l>
        <l>You in your own;â€” where to the World's last Date </l>
        <l>You shall survive, and Triumph over Fate; </l>
        <l>Nor need you to anothers Bounty one </l>
        <l>For what your self can on your self bestow. </l>
        <l>So Monarchs in full Health were wont to rear </l>
        <l>At their own charge, their future Sepulchre. </l>
        <l>Who thy Perfections fully wou'd commend </l>
        <l>Must think how others do their Hours mispend, </l>
        <l>In Trifling Visits, Pride, Impertinence </l>
        <l>Dress, Dancing, and Discourse quite void of Sence. </l>
        <l>To twirl a Fan, to please some foolish Beau, </l>
        <l>And sing an empty Song the most they know, </l>
        <l>In Body weak, more Impotent of mindâ€” </l>
        <l>Thus some have represented Woman-kind; </l>
        <l>But you your Sexes Champion are come forth </l>
        <l>To fight their Quarrel, and assert their Worth. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000489-006-a"/>
        <l>Our Salique Law of Wit you have destroy'd, </l>
        <l>Establish'd Female Claim, and Triumph'd o'er our Pride; </l>
        <l>While We look on, and with repining Eyes </l>
        <l>Behold you bearing off so rich a Prize, </l>
        <l>Spight of Ill-Nature we're compell'd t' approve </l>
        <l>Such dazling Worth, and spight of Envy love. </l>
        <l>Nor is this all th' applause that is your Due; </l>
        <l>You stand the first of Stage-Reformers too. </l>
        <l>No Vicious Stains pollute your moral Scene; </l>
        <l>Chast are your Thoughts, and your Expression clean. </l>
        <l>Strains such as yours the strictest Test will bear: </l>
        <l>Sing boldly then! nor busy Censure fear; </l>
        <l>Your Virgin Voice offends no Virgin Ear. </l>
        <l>Proceed, in Tragick Numbers to disclose </l>
        <l>Strange Turns of Fate, and unexpected Woes! </l>
        <l>Reward and punish; awfully dispence </l>
        <l>Heav'ns Iudgments, and declare a Providence! </l>
        <l>Nor let the Comick Muse your Labours share; </l>
        <l>'Tis Meaness after this the Sock to wear. </l>
        <l>Tho' that too merit Praise, 'tis nobler Toil </l>
        <l>T' extort a Tear, than to provoke a Smile. </l>

        <l>Your Servant Sirs, </l>

        </l>
        <l>There's some are wiser, and will walk away. </l>
        <l>For I who have heard the tale within can tell yee </l>
        <l>A worse disaster never yet befel yee; </l>
        <l>A Critick yonder has been stating Rules, </l>
        <l>To gain the Wise, and scorn the Herd of Fools; </l>
        <l>To which 'twas said, one Friend wou'd raise ten Foes, </l>
        <l>And that's too dear as common Friendship goes; </l>
        <l>Success with both is found no human task; </l>
        <l>Who please the Boxes will affront the Mask; </l>
        <l>To Charm, and to instruct's too great a trouble, </l>
        <l>'Tis hard for Pegasus to carry double. </l>
        <l>I argu'd much to entertain the Fools, </l>
        <l>They are the Poets and the Players Tools. </l>
        <l>Are sown so thick o'er Gallery, Box, and Pit, </l>
        <l>Can give success without the help of Wit; </l>
        <l>For one Grimace more favour will dispence, </l>
        <l>Than for whole Scenes that boast of stricter sence; </l>
        <l>Ev'n I by help of Band and cropt disguise, </l>
        <l>Can reach your hearts as Love does through your Eyes; </l>
        <l>Well the Fools Coat, the Fools defect supplies. </l>
        <l>But still Poetick Fate attends the Muse, </l>
        <l>This thriving Councel did our Fool refuse, </l>
        <l>She'd please no Crambo Critick, with dull Chime, </l>
        <l>Preferring sense, ev'n to engaging Rhime; </l>
        <l>Nor little Lord who still affects to be </l>
        <l>Learn'd in the knacks of visiting Gallantry. </l>
        <l>With scraps of Scandal, and Pert Repartee. </l>
        <l>On ruin bent I left her to her Fate, </l>
        <l>And stole to warn you for what treat you sat. </l>
        <l>If to the Wits alone our Plays are Writ, </l>
        <l>And Authors will allow so few have Wit, </l>
        <l>Why should they grumble at an Empty Pit. </l>
        <l>Since I have been thus frankly dealing now, </l>
        <l>But one request for my dear sake allow. </l>
        <l>With Crowded Benches we shall grace our Play, </l>
        <l>If each who thinks himself a Wit will stay. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, Spoke by Mrs Barry. </head>
        <l>FIrst Ladies I am sent to you, from whom </l>
        <l>Our Author hopes a favourable Doom, </l>
        <l>As Friends to Vertue, since 'tas been her End </l>
        <l>Vice to discourage, Vertue recommend; </l>
        <l>You've seen reveng'd an injurd Woman's Cause, </l>
        <l>And to such Iustice can't deny Applause, </l>
        <l>Felicia too expects you should approve </l>
        <l>A Wife's Fidelity, and Tender Love; </l>
        <l>Protect her Character as you'd be thought </l>
        <l>The Bright Originals from which 'twas wrought. </l>
        <l>Next to the Men I come, but cannot plead </l>
        <l>Your likeness as a motive to succeed, </l>
        <l>We rather hope none here will be offended </l>
        <l>Because none here cou'd think himself himself intended; </l>
        <l>Not one of you so sullenly wou'd slight </l>
        <l>A yielding Fair, at least not the first night, </l>
        <l>You cou'd not have the hearts, nor I believe </l>
        <l>Wou'd you to such a height as he deceive, </l>
        <l>'Twou'd startle you no doubt, for not to wrong yee, </l>
        <l>One Wife is thought too much by most among yee. </l>
        <l>Since I have done you justice, be this Day </l>
        <l>As just to us in censuring our Play, </l>
        <l>Not with Grimace, and words all noise, and Huff, </l>
        <l>Damn it, a Woman's! that must needs be Stuff; </l>
        <l>At Reason's Great Tribunal she'd appear, </l>
        <l>Tho' she has most from her decree to fear, </l>
        <l>But so condemn'd, conscious of Iustice done, </l>
        <l>Perhaps she'll mend, at least her faults, she'll own. </l>
        <l>If they are such as care may well correct, </l>
        <l>No pains to please you better she'll neglect, </l>
        <l>But if what she believes Poetick Rage, </l>
        <l>Is found th' infection of a Seribling Age, </l>
        <l>For ever she'll forsake the Darling Stage. </l>
