        <head>TO THE READER OF Mr. WILLIAM D'AVENANT'S Play. </head>
        <l>IT hath been said of old, that Playes are Feasts, </l>
        <l>Poets the Cookes, and the Spectators Guests, </l>
        <l>The Actors Waiters: From this Similie, </l>
        <l>Some have deriv'd an unsafe libertie </l>
        <l>To use their Judgements as their Tastes, which chuse </l>
        <l>Without controule, this Dish, and that refuse: </l>
        <l>But Wit allowes not this large Priviledge, </l>
        <l>Either you must confesse, or feele it's edge; </l>
        <l>Nor shall you make a currant inference </l>
        <l>If you trans-fer your reason to your sense: </l>
        <l>Things are distinct, and must the same appeare </l>
        <l>To every piercing Eye, or well-tun'd Eare. </l>
        <l>Though sweets with yours, sharps best with my taste meet, </l>
        <l>Both must agree this meat's or sharpe or sweet: </l>
        <l>But if I sent a stench or a perfume, </l>
        <l>Whilst you smell nought at all, I may presume </l>
        <l>You have that sense imperfect: So you may </l>
        <l>Affect a sad, merry, or humerous Play, </l>
        <l>If, though the kind distaste or please, the Good </l>
        <l>And Bad, be by your Judgement understood; </l>
        <l>But if, as in this Play, where with delight </l>
        <l>I feast my Epicurean appetite </l>
        <l>With rellishes so curious, as dispence </l>
        <l>The utmost pleasure to the ravisht sense, </l>
        <l>You should professe that you can nothing meet </l>
        <l>That hits your taste, either with sharpe or sweet, </l>
        <l>But cry out, 'tis insipid; your bold Tongue </l>
        <l>May doe it's Master, not the Author wrong; </l>
        <l>For Men of better Pallat will by it </l>
        <l>Take the just elevation of your Wit. </l>

        <l>BLesse mee you kinder Stars! How are wee throng'd? </l>
        <l>Alas! whom, hath our long sick-Poet wrong'd, </l>
        <l>That hee should meet together in one day </l>
        <l>A Session and a Faction at his Play? </l>
        <l>To Iudge, and to Condemne: For't cannot be </l>
        <l>Amongst so many here, all should agree. </l>
        <l>Then 'tis to such vast expectation rais'd, </l>
        <l>As it were to be wonder'd at, not prais'd: </l>
        <l>And this, good faith Sir Poet (if I've read </l>
        <l>Customes, or Men) strikes you, and your Muse dead! </l>
        <l>Conceave now too, how much, how oft each Eare </l>
        <l>Hath surfeited in this our Hemispheare, </l>
        <l>With various, pure, eternall Wit; and then </l>

        <l>Among themselves; our mirth must not at all </l>
        <l>Tickle, or stir their Lungs, but shake their Gall. </l>
        <l>So this joyn'd with the rest, makes mee agin </l>
        <l>To say, You and your Lady Muse within </l>
        <l>Will have but a sad doome; and your trim Brow </l>
        <l>Which long'd for Wreathes, you must weare naked now; </l>
        <l>'Lesse some resolve out of a courteous pride, </l>
        <l>To like and praise what others shall deride: </l>
        <l>So they've their humor too; and wee in spight </l>
        <l>Of our dull Braines, will thinke each side i'th right. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
