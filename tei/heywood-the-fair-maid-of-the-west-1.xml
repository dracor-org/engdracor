          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>EXcuse this my boldnesse, (I intreat you) and let it passe under the title of my love and respect, long devoted unto you; of which, if I endeavour to present the world with a due acknowledgement without the sordid expectation of reward, or servile imputation of flatterie, I hope it will be the rather accepted. I must ingenuously acknowledge, a weightier argument would have better suited with your grave imployment; but there are retirements necessarily belonging to all the labours of the body and brain: If in any such cessation, you will daigne to cast an eye upon this weak and unpollish't Poem, I shall receive it as a courtesie from you, much exceeding <pb xml:id="ep000058-003-a"/>any merit in mee, (my good meaning onely accepted.) Thus wishing you healthfull abilitie in body, untroubled content in minde: with the happie fruition of both the temporall felicities of the world present, and the eternall blessednesse of the life future; I still remain as ever, </p>

        <head>To the READER. </head>
        <p>CVrteous Reader, my Plaies have not beene exposed to the publike view of the world in numerous sheets, and a large volume; but singly (as thou seest) with great modesty, and small noise. These Comedies, bearing the title of, The fair Maid of the West: if they prove but as gratious in thy private reading, as they were plausible in the publick acting, I shall not much doubt of their successe. Nor neede they (I hope) much fear a rugged and censorious brow from thee, on whom the greatest and best in the kingdome, have vouchsafed to smile. I hold it no necessity to trouble thee with the Argument of the story, the matter it self lying so plainly before thee in Acts and Scenes, without any deviations, or winding indents. </p>
