        <p>[He is reported to be the Ancient'st of all the Kings in Italy, and was the first that brought in any Form of Religion thither. He Consecrated Groves, gave <pb n="7" xml:id="ep000773-005-b"/>Names unto Cities, erected Temples, ordained Sacrifices; from whom the Churches, as some say, were named Fana.] </p>
        <p>Upon his Lordships approach Faunus directs himself in these words; </p>

          <l>Albion that not long since was left forlorn, </l>
          <l>Her Bosom ransackt, and her Garments torn </l>
          <l>By her unnatural Children, now presumes </l>
          <l>Your presence, and her antient State assumes. </l>
          <l>Bless'd be the happy Change, the Sacred Cause </l>
          <l>Of our <hi>Religion, Liberty</hi>, and Laws. </l>
          <l>So great a Work could not accomplish'd be, </l>
          <l>Without restoring Heaven-born Monarchie; </l>
          <l>How happy are you, could you prize your good, </l>
          <l>And your Conditions rightly understood; </l>
          <l>Now Peace has got the upper hand of War, </l>
          <l>And Plenty hath exiled Famin far </l>
          <l>Remote from hence our fields are clad with Corn </l>
          <l>Whose laden Ears do listen to be shorn. </l>
          <l>The Husbandman hides not his Cattel, now, </l>
          <l>Lest that they shall be taken from the Plough; </l>
          <l>The Shepherd fears not those Sheep stealing men </l>
          <l>(Far worse then Wolves) of late, but laughs agen. </l>
          <l>And to his harmless flock tunes forth the Praise </l>
          <l>of Peace, and our Revived Halcion dayes. </l>
          <l>Thrice happy England in so bless'd a King, </l>

          <l>The Songs of Sion in the sacred Tongue, </l>
          <l>Converting old Men and Informing young. </l>
          <l>Where vile Oppression is supprest by Law, </l>
          <l>And Clemency doth more then rigour Awe. </l>
          <l>Then London, and my other Daughters, know </l>

          <l>And let no dirty thoughts Rebellious, prove </l>
          <l>The dark rewarders of his Serene love. </l>
          <p>The Speech ended, his Lordship and his Retinue move towards Milk-street, and there he is saluted by another Scene or Pageant, made in manner of a Chariot, in the Front whereof sits a living Figure, representing a Turk (alluding to his Lordships Quality, a Turkish Merchant, and so to Trade) his Habit is very rich, apted to the Fashion of that Countrey; in the body of the Pageant are three Turks more habited accordingly, and three Slaves employed in ordering and making up Commodities. </p>

          <l>IN all the primitive times Learning did shine </l>
          <l>Like to the Sun both speculative, and divine; </l>
          <l>The more she spread her self, the more she grew, </l>
          <l>In veneration and esteem; This drew </l>
          <l>The youth of famous Athens to admire </l>
          <l>Not only her rich beauty, but acquire </l>
          <l>Her as a Bride; for which their Genii strove, </l>
