        <head>To my Friend A. B. </head>
        <p>IF ever you gave your self the divertisement of reading the Preface to my <hi>Comedy of the Cheats</hi>, you may remember, I did as good as protest against Apologies; and yet, the case happens to be such at present, that I find my self (how unwilling soever) engag'd to tread that path yet once agen: To tell you how long since this Tragedy was first written, or why it has not been since acted, were but (in effect) to suspect your memory; 'Tis enough to me that you know both, and I doubt not, will be ready to do me right as you see occasion:— I pass it, and according to our wonted freedom shall only speak a few words to the thing— A Story of the Eastern Empire, between the years 1179. and 1183; and such perhaps, as might not be thought altogether unparalel to what our selves <pb xml:id="ep000782-003-a"/>have seen, were not the one, but too fresh in our memories, and the other, too far remov'd from our knowlodge— And now me thinks I hear you charging me with a <foreign xml:lang="lat">Non bene conveniunt</foreign>, The Story of 3 or 4 years, cramp'd into fewer hours! And why not?— My design was a History, and if I have kept the Connection, I may reasonably presume I have observ'd enough— Nay further, if I have dealt with it, as Procrustes with his guests, lop'd some, or stretch'd others, be pleased to consider, 'twas for the same reason, that I might the better fit unto my own moddel:— To be short, if I have once agen made my thoughts legible, and my self the subject of every mans opinion, how weak soever, be pleased, to such cavils as you may chance to meet with, to oppose this— That notwithstanding I may have written some few Plays, yet the Stage is the last thing I shall pretend to; And therefore, though possibly I could wish, <hi>Ut placerent quas fecissem fabulas</hi>, yet I was never so much in love with a full cry, as to believe, that all open'd alike, or that the approbation of one wise man, was not more worth, than the noise of a multitude:— <pb xml:id="ep000782-003-b"/>Let me not seem immodest if I close all with that of Plautus </p>
