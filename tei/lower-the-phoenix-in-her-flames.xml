        <p>IT was once disputed within me, whether to give this poore Phaenix birth or buriall, whether to commit her to the fire, and suppresse her in her ashes, or let her ascend againe in her owne nature and live; there was onely one reason to perswade the former, and that was your favourable and courteous approbation, divers considerations to urge the later, but the chiefest of all her imperfections. I have adventured notwithstanding by vertue of your patronage, to expose her to the publicke view and censure of the world, no longer now behaving my selfe as I have scene a timorous young souldier at his first entrance i'th' warre, ducke downe the head at every shot of th' enemy, but <pb xml:id="ep000133-003-a"/>rather as a bold and experienced Martialist under your Colours, runne resolutely on up to the Canons mouth of the most carping and most malitious Critick whatsoever, needing no other fortification then your protection, which is a sufficient guard and defence against their strongest invasion.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
