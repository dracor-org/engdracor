        <head>THE DEDICATION. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Mr. Bentley, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Have often (during this Plays being in the Press) been importun'd for a Preface; which you, I suppose, would have speak something in Vindication of the Comedy: Now to please you, Mr. Bentley, I will as briefly as I can speak my mind upon that occasion, which you may be pleas'd to accept of, both as a Dedication to your self, and next as a Preface to the Book. </p>
        <p>And I am not a little proud, that it has happened into my thoughts to be the first who in these latter years, has made an Epistle Dedicatory to his Stationer: It is a Complement as reasonable as it is Just. For, Mr. Bentley, you pay honestly for the Copy; and an Epistle to you is a sort of an Acquittance, and may be probably welcome; when to a Person of higher Rank and Order, it looks like an Obligation for Praises, which he knows he does not deserve, and therefore is very unwilling to part with ready Money for. </p>
        <p>As to the Vindication of this Comedy, between <pb xml:id="ep000665-003-a"/>Friends and Acquaintance, I believe it is possible, that as much may be said in it's behalf, as heretofore has been for a great many others: But of all the Apish qualities about me, I have not that of being fond of my own Issue; nay, I must confess my self a very unnatural Parent, for when it is once brought into the World, E'en let the Brat shift for it self, I say. </p>
        <p>The Objections made against the merit of this poor Play, I must confess, are very grievous. </p>
        <p>First, Says a Lady, that shall be nameless, because the World may think civilly of her; Fogh! oh Sherru! 'tis so filthy, so bawdy, no modest Woman ought to be seen at it: Let me dye, it has made me sick: When the World lies, Mr. Bentley, if that very Lady has not easily digested a much ranker morsel in a little Ale-house towards Paddington, and never made a Face at it: But your true Jilt is a Creature that can extract Bawdy out of the chastest sence, as easily as a Spider can Poison out of a Rose: They know true Bawdy, let it be never so much conceal'd, as perfectly as Falstaff did the true Prince by instinct: They will separate the true Metal from the Allay let us temper it as well as we can; some Women are the Touch-stones of filthiness. Though I have heard a Lady (that has more modesty than any of those the Criticks, <pb xml:id="ep000665-003-b"/>and I am sure more wit) say, She wonder'd at the impudence of any of her Sex, that would pretend to understand the thing call'd Bawdy. So, Mr. Bentley, for ought I perceive, my Play may be innocent yet, and the Lady mistaken in pretending to the knowledge of a Mystery above he●; though, to speak honestly, she has had besides her Wit a liberal Education; and 〈◊〉 we may credit the World has not buried her Talent neither. </p>
        <p>This is, Mr. Bentley, all I can say in behalf of my Play: Wherefore I throw it into Your Arms, make the best of it you can; praise, it to your Customers: Sell ten thousand of them if possible, and then you will compleat the wishes of </p>

        <l>On their inconstant Hero's cold neglects, </l>
        <l>Than we (provok'd by this Vngrateful Age,) </l>
        <l>Bear the hard Fate of our abandon'd Stage; </l>
        <l>With grief we see you ravisht from our Arms, </l>
        <l>And Curse the Feeble Vertue of our Charms: </l>
        <l>Curse your false hearts, for none so false as they, </l>
        <l>And curse the Eyes that stole those hearts away. </l>
        <l>Remember Faithless Friends there was a time, </l>
        <l>(But oh the sad remembrance of our Prime!) </l>
        <l>When to our Arms with eager Ioys ye flew, </l>
        <l>And we believ'd your treach'rous Hearts as true </l>

        <l>She's both your Loves, and your Religion's Test, </l>
        <l>The fairest Prelate of her time and best. </l>
        <l>We own her more deserving far then we, </l>
        <l>A just excuse for your inconstancy. </l>
        <l>Yet 'twas unkindly done to leave us so: </l>
        <l>First to betray with Love, and then undo, </l>
        <l>A horrid Crime y'are all addicted to. </l>
        <l>Too soon, alas, your Appetites are cloy'd, </l>
        <l>And Phillis rules no more, when once enjoy'd: </l>
        <l>But all rash Oaths of Love and constancy, </l>

        <l>Whilst she, poor Soul, rob'd of her dearest ease, </l>

        <l>WIth the discharge of Passions much opprest, </l>
        <l>Disturb'd in Brain, and pensive in his Breast, </l>
        <l>Full of those thoughts which make th' unhappy sad, </l>
        <l>And by Imagination half grown mad, </l>
        <l>The Poet led abroad his Mourning Muse, </l>
        <l>And let her range, to see what sport she'd chuse, </l>
        <l>Strait like a Bird got loose, and on the Wing, </l>
        <l>Pleas'd with her freedom, she began to Sing; </l>
        <l>Each Note was Eccho'd all the Vale along▪ </l>
        <l>And this was what she utter'd in her Song. </l>
        <l>Wretch, write no more for an uncertain fame, </l>
        <l>Nor call thy Muse, when thou art dull, to blame: </l>
        <l>Consider with thy self how th'art Vnfit </l>
        <l>To make that Monster of Mankind, a Wit: </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000665-041-a"/>
        <l>A Wit's a Toad, who swell'd with silly pride, </l>
        <l>Full of himself, scorns all the World beside; </l>
        <l>Civil would seem, though he good manners lacks. </l>
        <l>Smiles on all faces, rails behind all backs: </l>
        <l>If e're good natur'd, nought to Ridicule, </l>
        <l>Good nature melts a Wit into a Fool; </l>
        <l>Plac'd high, like some Iack-Pudding in a Hall </l>
        <l>At Christmas Revels he makes sport for all. </l>
        <l>So much in little praises he delights, </l>
        <l>But when he's angry draws his Pen and Writes: </l>
        <l>A Wit to no man will his dues allow, </l>
        <l>Wits will not part with a good Word that's due: </l>
        <l>So who e're Ventures on the Ragged Coast </l>
        <l>Of starving Poets, certainly is lost, </l>
        <l>They rail like Porters at the Penny-Post. </l>
        <l>At a new Author's Play see one but sit </l>
        <l>Making his snarling froward face of Wit, </l>
        <l>The Merit he allowes, and Praise he grants, </l>
        <l>Comes like a Tax from a poor Wretch that wants. </l>
        <l>O Poets, have a care of one another, </l>
        <l>There's hardly one amongst ye true to to'ther: </l>
        <l>Like Trincalo's and Stephano's ye Play, </l>
        <l>The lewdest tricks each other to betray. </l>
        <l>Like Foes detract, yet flatt'ring friendlike smile, </l>
        <l>Aud all is one another to beguile </l>
        <l>Of Praise, the Monster of your Barren Isle: </l>
        <l>Enjoy the prostitute ye so admire </l>
        <l>Enjoy her to the full of your desire, </l>
        <l>Whilst this poor Sribler wishes to retire, </l>
        <l>Where he may ne're repeat his Follies more, </l>
        <l>But Curse the Fate that wrackt him on your Shore. </l>
        <l>Now you, who this day as his Iudges sit, </l>
        <l>After y'ave heard what he has said of Wit, </l>
        <l>Ought for your own sakes not to be severe </l>
        <l>But show so much to think he meant none here. </l>
