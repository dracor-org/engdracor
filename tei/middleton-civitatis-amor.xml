          <p>Hauing thus briefly described the manner of his Highnesse Creation, with the honourable Seruice shewne to the Solemnitie, both by the Lords and Gentlemen of the Innes of Court, I should haue set a Period, but that the Knights of the Bath, being a principall part and ornament of this sacred Triumph, I can not passe them ouer without some remembrance: therefore thus much out of the Note of Directions, from some of the principall Officers of Armos, and some obseruation of credite, concerning the Order and Ceremonies of the Knighthood. </p>
          <p>The Lords and other that were to receiue the Honourable Order of the Bath, repayred on Satterday the second of Nouember to the Parliament house at Westminster, and there in the afternoone heard Euening Prayer, obseruing no other Ceremonie at that time, but onely the Heralds going before them in their ordinarie habites from thence to King Henrie the seauenths Chappell at Westminster, there to beginne their warrefare, as if they would employ their seruice for God especially; from whence, after <pb xml:id="ep000183-010-a"/>Seruice ended, they returned into the Chamber they were to suppe in: their supper was prepared all at one Table, and all sate vpon one side of the same, euery man hauing an Escutcheon of his Armes placed ouer his head, and certaine of the Kings Officers being appoynted to attend them. In this manner hauing taken their repast, seuerall beds were made ready for their lodging in another rowme hard by, after the same manner, all on one side; their beddes were Pallats, with Couerings, Testers, or Canopies of Red Say, but they vsed no Curtaines. </p>
          <p>The Knights in the meane while were withdrawne into the Bathing Chamber, which was the next rowme to that which they supped in; where, for each of them was prouided a seuerall bathing Tubbe, which was lined both within and without, with white Linnen, and couered with Red Say: wherein, after they haue said their prayers, and commended themselues to God, they bathe themselues, that thereby they might be put in minde, to be pure in bodie and soule from thenceforth; and after the Bath, they betooke themselues to their rest. </p>
          <p>Earely the next morning they were awakened with Musicke, and at their vprising, inuested in their Hermites habites, which was a Gowne of Gray Cloth girded close, and a Hoode of the same, and a linnen Coife vnderneath, and an Hankercher hanging at his girdle, cloth Stockings soaled with Leather, but no Shooes; and <pb xml:id="ep000183-010-b"/>thus apparelled, their Esquiers Gouernors, with the Heralds wearing the Coates of Armes, and sundry sorts of winde-Instruments before them, they proceede from their lodging, the meanest in order formost, as the nighr before, vntill they came to the Chappell, where after Seruice ended, their Oath was ministred vnto them by the Earle of Arundell Lord Marshall, and the Earle of Penbroke Lord Chamberlaine, in a solemne and ceremonious manner, all of them standing foorth before their stalles, and at their coming out making low reuerence towards the Altar, by which the Commissioners sate, then were they brought vp by the Heralds by two at once, the chiefest first, and so the rest, till all successiuely had receiued their Oath, which in effect was this; That aboue all things they should seek the honour of God, and maintenance of true Religion, loue their Soueraigne, serue their Countrie, helpe Maydens, Widdowes, and Orphans, and (to the vtmost of their power) cause Equity and Iustice to be obserued. </p>
          <p>This day, whilest they were yet in the Chappell, wine and sweet meates were brought them, and they departed to their Chamber to be disrobed of their Hermites weedes, and were reuested in Roabes of Crimson Taffata, implying they should be Martiall men, the Robes lined with white Sarcenet, in token of Sincerity, hauing white Hattes on their heads, with white Feathers, white Bootes on their legges, and <pb xml:id="ep000183-011-a"/>white Gloues tied vnto the strings of their Mantles: all which performed, they mount on horsebacke, the Saddle of blacke leather, the Arson white, Stirrop leathers blacke, gilt, the pectorall of blacke leather, with a crosse Paty of Siluer thereon, and without a Crupper, the Bridle likewise blacke, with a crosse Paty on the Forehead or Frontlet: each Knight betweene his two Esquiers well apparrelled, his Footeman attending, and his Page riding before him, carrying his Sword with the hiltes vpward, in a white leather Belt without Buckles or Studdes, and his Spurres hanging thereon. </p>
          <p>In this order ranked, euery man according to his degree, the best or chiefest first, they rode faire and softly towards the Court, the Trumpets sounding, and the Heralds all the way riding before them being come to the Kings hall, the Marshall meetes them, who is to haue their horses, or else 100. s. in money for his Fee: then conducted by the Heralds, and others appoynted for that purpose, his Maiestie sitting vnder his Cloth of Estate, gaue to them their Knighthood in this manner: </p>
          <p>First, the principall Lord that is to receiue the Order, comes, led by his two Esquiers, and his Page before him, bearing his Sword and Spurs, and kneeleth downe before his Maiestie, the Lord Chamberlain takes the Sword of the page, and deliuers it to the King, who puts the Belt ouer the necke of the Knight, aslope his breast, <pb xml:id="ep000183-011-b"/>placing the Sword vnder his left Arme: the second Nobleman of the chiefe about the King, puts on his Spurres, the right Spurre first; and so is the ceremony performed. In this sort Lord Maltreuers sonne and heire to the Erle of Arundell, Lord Marshall, which was the principall of this number, being first created, the rest were all consequently knighted alike: And when the solemnitie thereof was fully finished, they all returned in order as they came, sauing some small difference, in that the yongest or meanest knight went now formost, &amp; their Pages behinde them. </p>
          <p>Coming backe to the Parliament house, their dinner was ready prepared in the same rowme, and after the fashion as their supper was the night before; but being set, they were notto taste of any thing that stood before them, but with a modest carriage, and gracefull abstinence, to refraine: diuers kindes of sweet Musicke sounding the while; and after a conuenient time of sitting, to arise, and withdraw themselues, leauing the Table so furnished to their Esquiers and Pages. </p>
          <p>About fiue of the clocke in the afternoone, they rode againe to Court, to heare Seruice in the Kings Chappell, keeping the same order they did at their returne from thence in the morning, euery Knight riding betweene his two Esquiers, and his Page following him. </p>
          <p>At their entrance into the Chappell, the Heralds conducting them, they make a solemne reuerence, <pb xml:id="ep000183-012-a"/>the yongest Knight beginning, the rest orderly ensuing, and so one after another take their standing before their Stalls, where all being placed, the eldest Knight maketh a second Reuerence, which is followed to the yongest, and then all ascend into their Stalls, and take their accustomed places. </p>
          <p>Seruice then beginneth, and is very solemnly celebrated with singing of diuers Anthemes to the Organs, And when the Time of their Offertorie is come, the yongest Knights are summoned forth of their Stalls by the Heralds, doing reuerence first within their Stalls, and againe after they are discended, which is likewise imitated by all the rest; and being all thus come forth, standing before their Stalls as at first, the two eldest Knights with their swords in their hands, are brought vp by the Heralds to the Altar, where they offer their swords, and the Deane receiues them, of whom they presently redeeme them with an Angell in Gold, and then come downe to their former places, whilst two other are led vp in like manner: The ceremonie performed, and seruice ended, they depart againe in such order as they came, with accustomed Reuerence; At the Chappell doore as they came forth, they were encountred by the Kings Maister Cooke, who stood there with his white Apron &amp; Sleeues, and a chopping knife in his hand, and challenged their Spurres, which were likewise redeemed with a Noble in money, threatning <pb xml:id="ep000183-012-b"/>them neuerthelesse, that if they proued not true and loyall to the King his Lord and Maister, it must be his Office to hew them from their heeles. On Monday morning they all met together nigh at the Court, where in a priuate Roome appointed for them, they were cloathed in long Robes of Purple Sattin, with Hoods of the same, all lined and edged about with white Taffata: And thus appareled, they gaue their attendance vpon the Prince at his creation, &amp; dined that day in his presence at a side Boord, as is already declared. </p>
