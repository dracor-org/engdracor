        <head>TO HER GRACE the DUTCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MADAM, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THE following Play seems naturally to claim the Patronage of a Lady, for which Reason no true Englishman will wonder that the first Person who occurred to my Thoughts on this occasion should be the Dutchess of Marlborough. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000691-002-a"/>
        <p>Not all the Security we enjoy by our safe and honourable Peace, can make us unmindful of the Gratitude we owe to your Name. All the Blessings which have been procured for us by our late Treaties, are not greater, than what might have been expected from the long Course of the Duke of Marlborough's Victories. </p>
        <p>If we are at leisure to cultivate the Politer Arts, if our Trade flourishes, if our Credit rises both at Home and Abroad, if we have obtained a general Peace for our Allies, if the Catalans are obliged to us for our Protection, the Germans for our Faith, and the French for our Generosity; who could have promised to themselves less Honours and Advantages for their Country, from the many Glorious Campaigns and uninterrupted Successes of our late Great General. </p>
        <p>It has been often observed, that when the French have been worsted in the Field they have saved themselves by Treaties; but such are the consummate Abilities of our present Ministers, that the World is as much astonish'd at their Negotiations, <pb xml:id="ep000691-002-b"/>as it was before at the Duke of Marlborough's Conquests. </p>
        <p>There are indeed too many among us, who are apt to be affrighted at every thing that seems to threaten our Religion and Liberties; but why should private Men believe themselves in any Danger from the Pretender, when the Government is not apprehensive of it? But this is certain, we have less Reason to be so; while He is still living who has so often defeated the Ambition of France, and broken its best concerted Measures. </p>
        <p>Among the many eminent Virtues which I might here take occasion of celebrating in your Grace, I shall only single out that which I believe your Grace will be most delighted to hear mentioned, I mean that truly conjugal Friendship and Affection with which you accompany this Great Man in His Absence from His native Country, and share with him in all the Cares and Inquietudes his Extraordinary Merit has brought upon him. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000691-003-a"/>
        <p>That You may have many Years in reserve for your own mutual Happinesse as well as for your Country's Good, is the hearty Desire of every honest Man● and particularly of, Madam, </p>

        <head>ADVERTISEMENT. </head>
        <p>THE following TRAGEDY was Originally Written in French by the celebrated Monsieur RACINE, whose Master-Piece it is justly accounted; and having been translated into English, with considerable Additions, by Mr. BOYER, and pass'd the Correction and Approbation of the late famous Mr. DRYDEN, and several other Persons distinguish'd as well by their Wit and Learning, as by their Taste and Discernment, was acted with <hi>general Applause</hi>, towards the End of the Year 1699, and Beginning of 1700. The Reasons why this Excellent PLAY stopt, on a sudden, in a full Career, are, in some Measure, accounted for in Mr. BOYER'S Preface: To which he might <pb xml:id="ep000691-004-a"/>have added, That the Dutchess of MARLBOROUGH, who at that Time bore an irresistible Sway, bespoke the Comedy then in Vogue, during the Run of Iphigenia in Aulis; And that this Tragedy receiv'd no small Prejudice, from the Person that acted Eriphile, who sunk under the Weight of so great a Part. </p>
        <p>This TRAGEDY having lain dormant for many Years, was lately revived, in the most IRREGULAR MANNER, that was ever known or practised either on PARNASSUS, by Poets; or on the STAGE, by ACTORS. The Town has already done Mr. BOYER some Justice, by Discovering the Imposition, and by Finding out, that the VICTIM was no other than ACHILLES and IPHIGENIA in AULIS. The Publishing a SECOND EDITION of this Play, (which was out of Print) is sufficient to justify the Iudgment of the Publick, and vindicate Mr. Boyer's Right. But the manner in which his Performance, and Himself, have been abused is so flagrant and injurious, that he designs, in few Days, to publish a short DISSERTATION, <hi>on the </hi>PRESENT MANAGEMENT <hi>of the </hi>STAGE, <hi>Addressed to My Lord </hi>CHAMBERLAIN, wherein he shall set in a true Light, <pb xml:id="ep000691-004-b"/>the PERNICIOUS CONSEQUENCES of such <hi>Vnfair Practises </hi>both of some Writers and Players; and in particular, inquire into the Reason, Why Mr. Wilks declined to revive, this very Tragedy, for the Entertainment of the Duke D' AUMONT, who, by his Secretary Monsieur l' Able NADAL, had Intimated to Mr. Boyer, his Desire to see it represented; which Mr. Boyer signified to Mr. Wilks? </p>

        <head>TO THE PLAGIARY OF Mr. BOYER's IPHIGENIA. </head>
        <l>VAin is Racine's and Boyer's Labouring Wit! </l>
        <l>The one Improving what the other Writ: </l>
        <l>Both fall a Sacrifice to thy Third-Day </l>
        <l>And Lovely Iphigenia is thy Prey. </l>
        <l>Nor knows the Nimph if she should more detest </l>
        <l>Calchas or Thee; the Pirate or the Priest? </l>
        <l>Her ancient <hi>Tears and Griefs</hi>, from him proceed </l>
        <l>Who brought Her to Diana's Shrine to bleed: </l>
        <l>But that She <hi>Mourns unpitied </hi>in her Woes, </l>
        <l>The Wretched Virgin to thy Dulness owes. </l>
        <l>Her Life alone was Wicked Calchas's Aim: </l>
        <l>Thou touchest a yet tenderer Part, her Fame. </l>
        <l>Thy Theft has all her Grace and <hi>Lustre soil'd</hi>; </l>
        <l>Thou Stolest the Beauty first, and after spoil'd. </l>
        <l>So fares it with that <hi>desperate Band</hi>, who live </l>
        <l>On Prey and Rapine, and by <hi>Injury thrive</hi>. </l>
        <l>Those whom they Wrong, with Hatred they pursue, </l>
        <l>And not content to Rob, they Murder too. </l>

            <head>THE DEDICATION TO The Beautiful and Ingenious DIANA. </head>
            <opener>
              <salute>Madam, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>DEdications are grown so Modish, that a Play makes as ill a Figure without one, as a Beau in the Side-Box without a long Wig. </p>
            <p>Yet I must freely own, that the greatest Trouble this Tragedy gave me, was the fixing it on a proper Person to Patronize it. Those whose Merit entitles them to these solemn Addresses, are generally unwilling to have their Names expos'd; and such who are most fond of seeing their Pedigrees, and Encomiums prefix'd to a Play, do commonly fasten upon the Poet the scandalous Character of a vile Flatterer. </p>
            <p>One of my Friends advis'd me to offer this Piece to a great Lord; but not being Secretary to his Mistress, I was afraid of meeting with a cold Reception. Another would persuade me to Dedicate to a Courtier; but I am either too Modest or too Proud to appear with a cringing Assurance at a Levee; and too great a Lover of Truth to commend a Fop in Favour. Another would have me Address to a Beau-Knight; but he being lately broke at Basset, and his Taylor's and Perwig-maker's Bills coming thick upon him, I was unwilling to put in for one amongst his needy Visitants. Lastly, a Fourth would have engag'd me to make my Achilles and Iphigenia court the shelter of some Rich Citizen; but my Muse was too aspiring to prostitute herself to a Plebeian </p>
            <p>Thus having review'd all Patrons of all Ranks, and maturely consider'd the several pitiful Means by which some Poets intrude into their Protection, I was induc'd, for many Reasons, to lay this Tragedy on fair Diana ' Shrine. </p>
            <pb xml:id="ep000691-008-a"/>
            <p>First of all, as ancient Poets tell us, the <hi>Greek Iphigenia </hi>owing its Preservation to Diana in Aulis, I hope the Person who is willing to borrow the Name of that Goddess, will likewise receive the <hi>English Iphigenia </hi>under her Patronage. </p>
            <p>Besides, by thus prefixing your feign'd Name to this Play, I spare my self the trouble of a begging Visit, and you the Sight of a Dunning Dedicator. </p>
            <p>But, Madam, the most prevalent Motive with me is, That I may commend you without being suspected of Adulation, or making your Modesty uneasy. I may freely proclaim to the World, that you make Conquests by your Beauty, and secure them by your Wit; that your Sense equals your Wit, and that your good Humour is inferiour to neither. I may boldly say, that you are free with innocence; Modest without Affectation; and Virtuous without Pride. That at once you command Love and Respect; and that nothing surpasses the Charms of your Conversation, but your admirable way of Writing. </p>
            <p>Nay, I might take a greater Latitude with you than any Poet ever did with his Patron, for I might tell you of your Faults, and reproach your cruel Indifference, not to say, Ingratitude. I might confirm my constant Love to you, and expostulate your broken Promises of eternal Friendship. I might remind you of your Letters, without putting you to the Blush, or incurring my self the charge of Indiscretion, since nothing can be more secret than what I now speak in Publick. </p>
            <p>All these Advantages I find in Dedicating to my charming Diana; and if she proves so kind as to bless me once more with her endearing Company, I will esteem this Epistle better rewarded than any I writ before. I remain with all the Sincerity of a Lover and a Poet. </p>

            <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
            <p>POets, like most Lovers, are apt to boast the Favours, or complain of the Rigour of their Mistress, the Town: For my part, I am too discreet a Lover to boast, and too young a Poet to complain; and tho' the First run of this Play was but short, yet I must own my self oblig'd to the Civility of the English Nation; for on this Occasion, as on many others, I found that the Imputation of being inhospitable and rude to Strangers, which Horace charges on the Britons, reaches no higher than the Mob. </p>
            <p>Some of my Friends wonder'd that a Play which was acted with so much Applause, should stop so soon in its career. The Reason of it is obvious: This Tragedy came out upon the Neck of another of the same Name, which being the product of a Giant-Wit, and a Giant-Critick, like Horace's Mountain in Labour, had miserably balk'd the World's Expectation; and most People having been tir'd at Lincolns-Inn-Fields, did not care to venture their Patience at Drury-lane, upon a false Supposition that the two Iphigenia's were much alike: Whereas they differ no less than a young, airy Virgin, from a stale, antiquated Maid. </p>
            <p>Another difficulty this Play labour'd under, was its being acted at a time when the whole Town was so much, and so justly diverted by the <hi>Trip to the Jubilee</hi>. A merry Entertainment is certainly very improper to prepare the Tastes of an Audience to relish a grave and solemn Tragedy; for we are naturally angry with those who would make us Weep, when we are in a fit of Laughing. Yet notwithstanding all these Inconveniencies, my Iphigenia has pleas'd the fairest Part of the Town, I mean the Ladies, and having gain'd this Point, 〈…〉 my Wishes. </p>
            <p>Now when I call this Play mine, let me not be thought so arrogant as to assume the Honour o●●he Composition <pb xml:id="ep000691-009-a"/>wholly to my self. The Subject of it is taken from a Greek 〈◊〉 of Euripides: This Monsieur Racine brought upon 〈…〉 the Addition of the Episode of Eriphile, Achilles ● 〈◊〉, which 〈◊〉 his Plot more full 〈…〉. </p>
            <p>〈◊〉 Racine manag'd his Subject with a great deal of Mastery: His Expressions are free and lofty; his Sentiments noble and virtuous; his Passions moving and natural; 〈…〉 well manag'd and surprizing; the whole Piece regular. The success answer'd 〈◊〉 extraordinary Performance; Iphigenia at her first Appearance on the French 〈…〉, and commanded Admiration both from the Court and the City, for many Months successively; and set Monsieur standing above the Level of all French Tragick Writers. </p>
            <p>The great Success of Racine's Iphigenia, and the Encouragement I receiv'd from some Persons of a just Discernment, made me venture to make her appear upon an English Theatre; 〈◊〉, whether she has gain'd or lost any Thing by her new 〈◊〉, I leave to the Iudicious to determine. 〈◊〉 I can say in her Favour, is, That her numbers are easy and flowing; and that she speaks English like a genteel well-bred Lady, and not like an affected, pedantick Would-be-Wit. But in this I must own my self oblig'd to my honour'd and Ingenious Friend Mr. Cheek, to whom I owe some of my smoothest Lines. I wish he had a greater share in the whole Play, for then I am sure the Town would have lik'd it a great deal better. </p>

            <l>With Pride he owns he borrow'd from Racine. </l>

            <l>Why mayn't ours please you in an English dress </l>
            <l>Yet tho' like them the labour'd Scene he draws, </l>
            <l>With just regard to the Dramatick Laws, </l>
            <l>He'd not be thought of that vain-glorious Tribe, </l>
            <l>Who their own Rules imperiously prescribe. </l>
            <l>He better knows what to your Taste is due, </l>

            <l>His Muse in Nature's Majesty appears, </l>
            <l>She has no Sounds Tremendous to the Ears; </l>
