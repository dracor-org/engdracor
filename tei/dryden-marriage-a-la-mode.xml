        <p>When I entered the library of Mr. Laurence Hutton some time ago I did not at first know whether most to admire the studious quiet of the room itself, the bric-à-brac on the tables, the etchings and odd plates on the walls, or the books on the shelves. I decided finally in favor of the books. </p>
        <p>Old plays and collections of old playbills, a rare old edition of ' The British Essayists; ' an original edition of Fielding's ' Pamela's Conduct in High Life, ' (second edition, 1741;) a scarce continuation of the genuine ' Pamela, ' by an unauthentic Samuel Richardson. These and many more tempt the eye and hand. I have no time (to mention what beautiful work in an illustrating way Mr. Hutton is making of a copy of Stedman's ' Poets of America. ' I have not time to speak of the original edition of Dryden's ' Marriage à la Mode, ' bound by Rivière, presented to mine host, on the occasion of his wedding, by Edmund Gosse. </p>

        <head>To the Right Honourable, The EARL of ROCHESTER. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>My Lord, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Humbly Dedicate to Your Lordship that Poem, of which you were pleas'd to appear an early Patron, before it was Acted on the Stage. I may yet go farther, with your permission, and say, That it receiv'd amendment from your noble hands, e're it was fit to be presented. You may please likewise to remember, with how much favour to the Authour, and indulgence to the Play, you commended it to the view of His Majesty, <pb xml:id="ep000527-004-a"/>then at Windsor, and by His Approbation of it in Writing, made way for its kind reception on the Theatre. In this Dedication therefore, I may seem to imitate a Custom of the Ancients, who offer'd to their Gods the Firstlings of the Flock, which I think they call'd <hi>Ver Sacrum</hi>, because they help'd 'em to increase. I am sure, if there be any thing in this Play, wherein I have rais'd my self beyond the ordinary lowness of my Comedies, I ought wholly to acknowledge it to the favour, of being admitted into your Lordship's Conversation. And not onely I, who pretend not to this way, but the best Comick Writers of our Age, will joyn with me to acknowledge, that they have copy'd the Gallantries of Courts, the Delicacy of Expression, and the Decencies of Behaviour, from your Lordship, with more success, then if they had taken their Models from the Court of France. But this, my Lord, will be no wonder to the world, which knows the excellencie of your Natural parts, and those you have acquir'd in a Noble Education. That which with more reason I admire, is, that being so absolute a Courtier, you have not forgot, either the ties of Friendship, or the practise of Generosity. In my little Experience of a Court (which I confess I desire not to improve) I have found in it much of Interest, and more of Detraction: Few men there have that assurance of a Friend, as not to be made ridiculous by him, when they are absent. There are a midling sort of Courtiers, who become <pb xml:id="ep000527-004-b"/>happy by their want of wit; but they supply that want, by an excess of malice to those who have it. And there is no such persecution as that of fools: they can never be considerable enough to be talk'd of themselves; so that they are safe onely in their obscurity, and grow mischievous to witty men, by the great diligence of their envy, and by being always present to represent and aggravate their faults. In the mean time they are forc'd, when they endeavour to be pleasant, to live on the Offalls of their Wit, whom they decry; and either to quote it, (which they do unwillingly) or to pass it upon others for their own. These are the men who make it their business to chase Wit from the Knowledge of Princes, lest it should disgrace their ignorance. And this kind of malice your Lordship has not so much avoided, as surmounted. But if by the excellent temper of a Royal Master, always more ready to hear good than ill, if by his inclination to love you, if by your own merit and address, if by the charmes of your Conversation, the Grace of your Behaviour, your knowledge of Greatness and Habitude in Courts, you having been able to preserve your self with Honour in the midst of so dangerous a Course; yet at least the remembrance of those Hazards has inspir'd you with pity for other men, who being of an inferiour Wit and Quality to you, are yet Persecuted, for being that in Little, which your Lordship is in Great. For the quarrel of those people extends it self to any <pb xml:id="ep000527-005-a"/>thing of sense; and if I may be so vain to own it amongst the rest of the Poets, has sometimes reach'd to the very borders of it, even to me. So that, if our general good fortune had not rais'd up your Lordship to defend us, I know not whether any thing had been more ridiculous in Court, than Writers. 'Tis to your Lordship's favour we generally owe our Protection and Patronage: And to the Nobleness of your Nature, which will not suffer the least shadow of your Wit to be contemn'd in other men. You have been often pleas'd not onely to excuse my imperfections, but to vindicate what was tolerable in my Writings from their censures And what I never can forget, you have not onely been careful of my Reputation, but of my Fortune. You have been Sollicitous to supply my neglect of my self; and to overcome the fatal Modesty of Poets, which submits them to perpetual wants, rather then to become importunate with those people, who have the liberality of Kings in their disposing; and who dishonouring the Bounty of their Master, suffer such to be in necessity, who endeavour at least to please him: and for whose entertainment He has generously provided, if the Fruits of His Royal favour were not often stopp'd in other hands. But your Lordship has given me occasion, not to complain of Courts, whil'st you are there. I have found the effects of your Mediation in all my Concernments; and they were so much the more noble in you, because they were wholly voluntary. <pb xml:id="ep000527-005-b"/>I became your Lordship's (if I may venture on the Similitude) as the world was made, without knowing him who made it; and brought onely a passive obedience to be your Creature. This Nobleness of yours I think my self the rather oblig'd to own, because otherwise it must have been lost to all remembrance: for you are endued with that excellent quality of a frank Nature, to forget the good which you have done. </p>
        <p>But, my Lord, I ought to have consider'd, that you are as great a Judge, as you are a Patron; and that in praising you ill, I shall incurre a higher note of ingratitude, then that I thought to have avoided. I stand in need of all your accustom'd goodness for the Dedication of this Play: which though, perhaps, it be the best of my Comedies, is yet so faulty, that I should have fear'd you, for my Critick, if I had not with some policy given you the trouble of being my Protector. Wit seems to have lodg'd it self more Nobly in this Age, than in any of the former: and people of my mean condition, are onely Writers, because some of the Nobility, and your Lordship in the first place, are above the narrow praises which Poesie could give you. But let those who love to see themselves exceeded, encourage your Lordship in so dangerous a quality: for my own part, I must confess, that I have so much of self-interest, as to be content with reading some Papers of your Verses, without desiring you should proceed to a Scene or Play: with <pb xml:id="ep000527-006-a"/>the common prudence of those, who are worsted in a Duel, and declare they are satisfied when they are first wounded. Your Lordship has but another step to make, and from the Patron of Wit, you may become its Tyrant: and Oppress our little Reputations with more ease then you now protect them. But these, my Lord, are designs, which I am sure you harbour not; any more then the <hi>French King </hi>is contriving the Conquest of the Swissers. 'Tis a barren Triumph, which is not worth your pains, and wou'd onely rank him amongst your Slaves, who is already, </p>

        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <l>LOrd, how reform'd and quiet we are grown, </l>
        <l>Since all our Braves and all our Wits are gone: </l>
        <l>Fop-corner now is free from Civil War: </l>
        <l>White-Wig and Vizard make no longer jar. </l>
        <l>France, and the Fleet, have swept the Town so clear, </l>
        <l>That we can Act in peace, and you can hear. </l>
        <l>'Twas a sad sight, before they march'd from home, </l>
        <l>To see our Warriours, in Red Wastecoats, come, </l>
        <l>With hair tuck'd up, into our Tireing-room. </l>
        <l>But 'twas more sad to hear their last Adieu, </l>
        <l>The Women sob'd, and swore they would be true; </l>
        <l>And so they were, as long as e're they cou'd: </l>
        <l>But powerful Guinnee cannot be withstood, </l>
        <l>And they were made of Play house flesh and bloud. </l>
        <l>Fate did their Friends for double use ordain, </l>
        <l>In Wars abroad, they grinning Honour gain, </l>
        <l>And Mistresses, for all that stay, maintain. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000527-007-a"/>
        <l>Now they are gone, 'tis dead Vacation here, </l>
        <l>For neither Friends nor Enemies appear. </l>
        <l>Poor pensive Punk now peeps ere Plays begin, </l>
        <l>Sees the bare Bench, and dares not venture in: </l>
        <l>But manages her last Half crown with care, </l>
        <l>And trudges to the Mall, on foot, for Air. </l>
        <l>Our City Friends so far will hardly come, </l>
        <l>They can take up with Pleasures nearer home; </l>
        <l>And see gay Shows, and gawdy Scenes elsewhere: </l>
        <l>For we presume they seldom come to hear. </l>
        <l>But they have now ta'n up a glorious Trade, </l>
        <l>And cutting Moorcraft, struts in Masquerade. </l>
        <l>There's all our hope, for we shall show to day, </l>
        <l>A Masquing Ball, to recommend our Play: </l>
        <l>Nay, to endear 'em more, and let 'em see, </l>
        <l>We scorn to come behind in Courtesie, </l>
        <l>We'll follow the new Mode which they begin, </l>
        <l>And treat 'em with a Room, and Couch within: </l>
        <l>For that's one way, how e're the Play fall short, </l>
        <l>T' oblige the Town, the City, and the Court. </l>

        <head>Epilogue. </head>
        <l>THus have my Spouse and I inform'd the Nation, </l>
        <l>And led you all the way to Reformation. </l>
        <l>Not with dull Morals, gravely writ, like those, </l>
        <l>Which men of easie Phlegme, with care compose. </l>
        <l>Your Poet's of stiff words, and limber sense, </l>
        <l>Born on the confines of indifference. </l>
        <l>But by examples drawn, I dare to say, </l>
        <l>From most of you, who hear, and see the Play. </l>
        <l>There are more Rhodophils in this Theatre, </l>
        <l>More Palamedes, and some few Wives, I fear. </l>
        <l>But yet too far our Poet would not run, </l>
        <l>Though 'twas well offer'd, there was nothing done. </l>
        <l>He would not quite the Woman's frailty bare, </l>
        <l>But stript 'em to the waste, and left 'em there. </l>
        <l>And the men's faults are less severely shown, </l>
        <l>For he considers that himself is one. </l>
        <l>Some stabbing Wits, to bloudy Satyr bent, </l>
        <l>Would treat both Sexes with less complement: </l>
        <l>Would lay the Scene at home, of Husbands tell, </l>
        <l>For Wenches, taking up their Wives i' th' Mell, </l>
        <l>And a brisk bout which each of them did want, </l>
        <l>Made by mistake of Mistris and Gallant. </l>
        <l>Our modest Authour, thought it was enough </l>
        <l>To out you off a Sample of the stuff: </l>
        <l>He spar'd my shame, which you, I'm sure, would not, </l>
        <l>For you were all for driving on the Plot: </l>
        <l>You sigh'd when I came in to break the sport, </l>
        <l>And set your teeth when each design fell short. </l>
        <l>To Wives, and Servants all good wishes lend, </l>
        <l>But the poor Cuckold seldom finds a friend. </l>
        <l>Since therefore Court and Town will take no pity, </l>
        <l>I humbly cast my self upon the City. </l>
