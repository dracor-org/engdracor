        <head>TO THE DUTCHESS OF ALBEMARLE. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Madam, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHen I consider what favourable Reception my first humble Supplications in this kind have had from your Graces hand, I cannot think my Duty fully paid, nor my Adoration sufficiently exprest, till I Dedicate my whole Life and Labours to your Grace. 'Tis not one act of Devotion that can make a Zealot; and therefore as I made a Present then, I pay you <pb xml:id="ep000718-003-a"/>a Tribute now. And though this Poem has but little Merit of its own, yet encouraged by the Honours it has received, like Pages to Princes, it owes its Boldness to its Education; and since your Grace gave it leave to be a troublesome Guest at New-Hall, it lik'd the Entertainment so well, that it resolves to Live and Dye there; and 'tis an Ambition in some respect to be justified; for Poetry should always make up part of the Trains of Princes, especially theirs whose Excellencies are so Divine a subject for it. Vnder that shelter I approach your Grace, when I must own I have play'd the Plagiary in making the Dutchess of Albemarle the Pattern for my Roxolana; only with this difference, that I have copyed below the Life. Your Grace has all her Vertue, without the allay of her Vanity; and this advantage above her, that Your Grace possesses those Charms which Story never attributed to Roxolana; Her Beauty could subdue, but not secure her Solyman. But your Graces Victories are more compleat; For if our English Chronicle <pb xml:id="ep000718-003-b"/>(spight of the fashionable liberty of a Licentious Age) would Character the perfect happiness of a Princely Pair, it must describe the Influence of the Dutchess of Albemarle over the unalterable Affections of her Lord: And as in Duty to such eminent Virtues; &amp; such infinite Perfections, even the most ill-natur'd Age unanimously speaks of your Grace with Veneration; and to secure that Fame your Virtues have so justly acquired, your Grace is as Cautious in the Preservation of it: But so impregnable are your <hi>Sacred Principles </hi>of Honour, that your Graces Care in that, is but like His, who raises Bulwarks to defend that Town, which of it self before was inaccessible; nor can I more reasonably impute the Duke of Albemarles, and your Graces more frequent Residence at New-Hall, to any other than a true English Nobleness; as knowing that your Greatness can better fill a Court than make a part of one. I could be very prolix on so excellent a Theam, for 'tis easie to Write where all Man-kind Dictates; and I must confess 'tis <pb xml:id="ep000718-004-a"/>the highest Bliss of an Authour, to have those Patrons whose Merits are above Flattery, where the Titles of Great and Good may he given without a Blush. This made Horace speak so largely in the Commendations of his Maecenas, and Juvenal say so so little in the praise of Trajan: For my part I account it my chief Happiness to have been a Witness of your Graces Greatness, and my highest Contemplation to be an Admirer of it. The humblest of which Admirers, is </p>

        <head>PROLOGVE. </head>
        <l>APplause is grown a strange Coy Mrs. now; </l>
        <l>Courted by All, and yet obtain'd by few. </l>
        <l>'Tis true, when any Favourites Plays appear, </l>
        <l>Then Kindness and Good-nature brings you here: </l>
        <l>And to secure the Censures of the Town, </l>
        <l>The Pit is fill'd with Friends in the Fore-noon; </l>
        <l>And those five long expecting hours you stay, </l>
        <l>Are spent in making Proselytes to th' Play. </l>
        <l>Such Favour is not common; nor are Wit </l>
        <l>And Sense the only means of gaining it. </l>
        <l>That happy Man, the Author, you commend, </l>
        <l>Must be at once a Poet and a Friend: </l>
        <l>Honour'd by the acquaintance of the Great; </l>
        <l>His Conversation Eminent, as his Wit. </l>
        <l>And as th' effect of your kind Influence, </l>
        <l>We've seen such refin'd Fancy, so much sense, </l>
        <l>Such Plays as do deserve so much Applause, </l>
        <l>They need no Favour to support their Cause. </l>
        <l>But since our Author wants that Interest, </l>
        <l>And those perfections which delight you best; </l>
        <l>And none of those kind leading Votes can boast, </l>
        <l>Let not his Play for his hard Fate be lost, </l>
        <l>What if our Author be not one of You; </l>
        <l>Wit should like Coyne pass current from a Jew: </l>
        <l>And should not its Esteem like Medals hold, </l>
        <l>Where th' Image more than weight gives price to th' Gold. </l>
        <l>Gallants, let Wit the Fate of Beauty find; </l>
        <l>Be to it, wheresoe're you meet it, kind: </l>
        <l>I'm sure Variety best pleases there. </l>
        <l>The Mrs. you maintain Gay, Brisk, and Fair, </l>
        <l>Does not so much your stock of Kindness reap; </l>
        <l>But you can spend some hours on Ioys more cheap. </l>
        <l>And so </l>
        <l>On humble Writers let some favours fall; </l>
        <l>Let not the Dons of Wit engross you all. </l>

        <l>HOw many has our Rhimer kill'd to day? </l>
        <l>What need of Siege and Conquest in a Play, </l>
        <l>When Love can do the work as well as they? </l>
        <l>Yet 'tis such Love as you've scarce met before: </l>
        <l>Such Love I'm sure as English ground ne're bore. </l>
        <l>Had half the injur'd Ladys of this Age, </l>
        <l>His Roxolana's kindness, and her Rage, </l>
        <l>What heaps on heaps of Female-suff'rers here, </l>
        <l>Would your good Men make Martyrs in one year? </l>
        <l>But thanks to Heav'n you've not her fond Disease: </l>
        <l>E'ne let 'em range and wander where they please; </l>
        <l>You're not such Fools to think of Poysoning yet; </l>
        <l>You want her Love, but you have twice her Wit. </l>
        <l>Dying's a Mode your wiser thoughts contemn: </l>
        <l>You've a more pleasing way to punish 'em. </l>
        <l>And should our Brood of Gallants take this rule, </l>
        <l>And turn such Lovers as his Persian Fool, </l>
        <l>Kind Husband then might peaceably discover </l>
        <l>An Assignation made 'twixt Spouse and Lover. </l>
        <l>Leave you at Cribbedge, let you see a Play, </l>
        <l>Or take the Ayre in a fair Summers day; </l>
        <l>Let you stay out in Masquerade whole Nights, </l>
        <l>With twenty other Innocent delights, </l>
        <l>And no harm done.— And yet how wilde soe're </l>
        <l>The humours of this brisk mad Age appear, </l>
        <l>'Tis ten to one but th' Author still will say, </l>
        <l>Your Vertues were the patterns of his Play; </l>
        <l>And swear you down, </l>
        <l>His Love and Honour both were stol'n from you; </l>
        <l>And from your Features he his Heroes drew. </l>
        <l>There's ne're a Comick Writer but will say, </l>
        <l>You're all of you the Patterns of his Play: </l>
        <l>Yet takes your Pictures at so damn'd a light; </l>
        <l>Paints you so Ugly, that your Looks would fright. </l>
        <l>And yet their Plays are your most dear delight. </l>
        <l>Why in your hearts may not th' Heroicks share? </l>
        <l>Those make you worse, these better than you are. </l>
        <l>And Flatt'rers sure should not successless prove, </l>
        <l>When those that do abuse you have your Love. </l>
