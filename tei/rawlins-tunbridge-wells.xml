        <l>TH' Old English Stage, confin'd to Plot and Sense, </l>
        <l>Did hold abroad but small intelligence, </l>
        <l>But since th' invasion of the forreign Scene, </l>
        <l>Iack pudding Farce, and thundering Machine, </l>
        <l>Painted to your grave Ancestours unknown, </l>
        <l>(Who never disliked wit because their own) </l>
        <l>There's not a Player but is turned a scout, </l>
        <l>And every Scribler sends his Envoys out </l>
        <l>To fetch from <hi>Paris, Venice</hi>, or from Rome, </l>
        <l>Fantastick fopperies to please at home. </l>
        <l>And that each act may rise to your desire, </l>
        <l>Devils and Witches must each Scene inspire, </l>
        <l>Wit rowls in Waves, and showers down in Fire. </l>
        <l>With what strange Ease a Play may now be writ, </l>
        <l>When the best half's composed by painting it? </l>
        <l>And that in th' Ayr, or Dance lyes all the Wit? </l>
        <l>True Sense or Plot would fooleries appear, </l>
        <l>Faults (I suppose) you seldome meet with here, </l>
        <l>For 'tis no mode to profit by the ear. </l>
        <l>Your souls (we know) are seated in your Eies, </l>
        <l>An Actress in a Cloud's a strange surprize, </l>
        <l>And you ne're paid trebble prizes to be wise. </l>

        <l>No mighty Sense to make the Criticks jar, </l>
        <l>And set the envious Tribe at mortal War. </l>
        <l>No Lines so rare, intrigues so wondrous wity </l>
        <l>Enough t' adjourn the Wits to a Committee, </l>
        <l>And make the Chair-man o'th' Cabal cry, ram him, </l>
        <l>Confound him, sink him, split him, rot him, damn him, </l>
        <l>Down with him for a sawcy son of a Whore; </l>
        <l>He must be damn'd, the Dog shall write no more. </l>
        <l>No, thanks to our safe Authors milder Stars, </l>
        <l>He has no such dangers, no such threatning fears, </l>
        <l>He gives you no occasion for your spight, </l>
        <l>Is no pretender to their fame that Write. </l>
        <l>Then Gentlemen, you may be kind to Night▪ </l>
        <l>Yes there indeed, 'tis worth your while to frown, </l>
        <l>'Tis victory to run great Authors down. </l>
        <l>But let </l>
        <l>This Triflle of a Play creep safely under, </l>
        <l>For Gallants 'tis too humble for your Thunder. </l>
