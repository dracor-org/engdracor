        <p>SInce I must own this Comedy, which I now humbly Present to Your Lordship, to be very deficient, I am sure I have done well to make choice of a Patron so able to protect it, as Your Lordship is. I am heartily willing to confess my want of Ability in writing; but am proud of an opportunity to record the General Approbation the Town has been pleas'd to afford me; a great share of which must be attributed to Your Lordship's Appearance on my behalf. </p>
        <p>I have been long desirous of making some evident Acknowledgments for the Favours I have received at Your Lordship's hands. And however I have now fail'd in my Performance, I have done my self right in publishing my Thanks; Returns which are most justly due to Your Lordship: To You, my Lord, whose early Actions I have seen with Admiration; and whose future Atchievements will, I am confident, be answerable to the Honours which are <pb xml:id="ep000517-003-a"/>devolv'd to You from a most Noble and Heroick Ancestor. I shall herein wave any thing that may have the least resemblance to Flattery in respect to Your Lordship, or to Ostentation as to my self; and so far deviate from the common method of Epistles Dedicatory, that I shall not trouble Your Lordship with a single Quotation. What Acquaintance I have with Criticisms, I will never shew by collecting Sentences, nor by reciting the Names of Authors, lest at the same time I should discover my want of those most essential parts which I ought to have retain'd in reading them. If for the future I shall be able to accomplish what will be any ways suitable to the Encouragement▪ Your Lordship has been pleas'd to bestow on me, it will wholly answer the Intentions, as well as the Ambition, of, </p>

        <l>Can cheat at Cards, Slur, Strike, or Palm ● Dye, </l>
        <l>Break Windows too, with Mid-night Gallantry. </l>
        <l>Thus being qualify'd, I need not fear, </l>

        <l>And be a Captain by another Year. </l>

        <l>I shall have learnt to Manage an Attack; </l>
        <l>I'll Court you then in Military Strain, </l>
        <l>And, by my Dint of Conduct, Conquest gain: </l>
        <l>But e'er I bid adieu, Faith I've a mind </l>

        <l>May never Wife any Occasion miss, </l>
        <l>To wipe her Lips of Husband's nauseous Kiss. </l>
        <l>May no Rich Widow e'er her Kindness smother, </l>
