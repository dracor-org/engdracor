        <l>To seeke for praise by making bragges, oft times doth get a breach. </l>
        <l>We list not ride the rowling rackes, that dims the christall skies, </l>
        <l>We mean to set no glimmering glance before your curteous eies: </l>
        <l>We search not Plutoes pensiue pit, nor taste of Limbo lake: </l>
        <l>We do not shew of warlike fight, as shield and sword to shake: </l>
        <l>We speak not of the powers diuine, ne yet of furious sprights: </l>
        <l>We do not seeke high hils to clime, nor talke of loues delights: </l>
        <l>We do not here present to you the threshar with his flayle, </l>
        <l>Ne do we here present to you the milk-maid with her payle: </l>
        <l>We shew not you of countrey toile, as hedger with his bill: </l>
        <l>We do not bring the husbandman to lop and top with skill: </l>
        <l>We pay not here the Gardners part to plant, to set and sow: </l>
        <l>You meruaile then what wares we haue to furnish out our show. </l>
        <l>Your patience yet we craue a while till we haue trimd our stall: </l>
        <l>Then yong and old come and behold our wares, &amp; buy them all. </l>
        <l>Then if our wares shall seeme to you, well wouen, good &amp; fine, </l>
