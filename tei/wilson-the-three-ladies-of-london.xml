        <l>To seeke for praise by making bragges, oft times doth get a breach. </l>
        <l>We list not ride the rowling rackes, that dims the christall skies, </l>
        <l>We mean to set no glimmering glance before your curteous eies: </l>
        <l>We search not Plutoes pensiue pit, nor taste of Limbo lake: </l>
        <l>We do not shew of warlike fight, as shield and sword to shake: </l>
        <l>We speak not of the powers diuine, ne yet of furious sprights: </l>
        <l>We do not seeke high hils to clime, nor talke of loues delights: </l>
        <l>We do not here present to you the threshar with his flayle, </l>
        <l>Ne do we here present to you the milk-maid with her payle: </l>
        <l>We shew not you of countrey toile, as hedger with his bill: </l>
        <l>We do not bring the husbandman to lop and top with skill: </l>
        <l>We pay not here the Gardners part to plant, to set and sow: </l>
        <l>You meruaile then what wares we haue to furnish out our show. </l>
        <l>Your patience yet we craue a while till we haue trimd our stall: </l>
        <l>Then yong and old come and behold our wares, &amp; buy them all. </l>
        <l>Then if our wares shall seeme to you, well wouen, good &amp; fine, </l>
        <l>We hope we shall your custome haue againe another time. </l>

            <l>Whereby thou hast solde thy soule to feele like torment with her, </l>
            <l>Which torments comprehended are in the worme of Conscience, </l>
            <l>who raging still, shall nere haue end, a plague for thine offence, </l>
            <l>Care shall be thy comfort, and sorrow shall thy life sustaine, </l>
            <l>thou shalt be dying, yet neuer dead, but pining still in endlesse paine. </l>
            <l>Diligence conuey her to Lucar, let that be her reward, </l>
            <l>Because vnto her cankered coyne she gaue her whole regard. </l>
            <l>But as for Conscience, carrie her to prison, </l>
            <l>there to remaine vntill the day of generall session: </l>
            <l>Thus we make an end, </l>
            <l>Knowing that the best of vs all may amend: </l>
            <l>UUhich God graunt to his good will and pleasure, </l>
            <l>That we be not corrupted with the vnsatiate desire of vanishing earthly treasure: </l>
            <l>For Couetousnesse is the cause of wresting mans Conscience, </l>
            <l>Therefore restraine thy lust, and thou shalt shun the offence. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
