        <head>TO THE ILLUSTRIOUS and Truly NOBLE Prince, JAMES, Duke, Marquess, and Earl of Ormond in England and Ireland; Earl of Ossory, and Viscount Thurles; Baron of Arclo; Lord of the Regallities and Liberties of the County of Tiperary; Baron of Lanthony; Earl of Brecknock; Chancellor of the University of Oxford; one of the Lords of the Bed-Chamber to His Sacred Majesty, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. </head>

          <salute>May it Please Your Grace, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHEN first my Propitious or Malignant Stars influenc'd the little Genius I now pretend to in Poetry, the Incouragement I had from your Noble Grandfather (whose Extraordinary Iudgment in the Beauties of that Art, as well as Generous Candour in Excusing the Errours of it, render'd him best capable of being a Patron ingag'd me to Launch my ill ballass'd Bark into an Ocean where most of our Tribe too late find themselves <pb xml:id="ep000550-003-a"/>becalm'd with uncertain Applause, or else wrack'd in the storm of ill-natur'd Criticism. Yet had that Illustrious Hero's Commands such an August Prerogative over me, that knowing my Fame sufficiently Establish'd in his Applause, successful enough I ventur'd on, 'till his never to be forgotten loss to all in General, made me too sadly deplore my own in particular. </p>
        <p>How Charming a thing is Dignity, when adorn'd with the glittering Crown of Sence, and the humble Robe of Humility: The Great Ormond was blest with both, in perfection; and not only a true Iudge and Generous Patron of Arts and Sciences, but modestly familiar with Virtue, tho' in Rags; never slighting the poor Scholar for his Thread-bare Coat, nor pleas'd with the vain outside of an Embroyder'd Fopp, whose inside he knew to be unfurnish'd. </p>
        <p>I infer this, as lamenting the ill fortune of Poets, that are not bless'd with a Friendly Party, or a Iudicious Patron, whose allow'd Vnderstanding, as well as generous good Nature can defend their Works from Malicious Censurers; the Time's Vices will bear no Reflection, and let the Play be never so just to the Rules, if a <hi>Rott me Spark </hi>finds himself hit, or Madam <hi>La Pupsey </hi>takes the hint that her dear Lap-Dog is expos'd, the Labour it self is like to be the Poet's only Reward: Modest Reproof is taken for absurd Abuse, and honest Satyr for Dogmatick Slaunder. </p>
        <p>And though Horace, reflecting upon such as are blind to their own Vices in his time, had Courage enough to dare to <pb xml:id="ep000550-003-b"/>tell'em, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Stultus, &amp; Improbus, hic Amor est dignusque notari. </foreign>Yet had he liv'd in this Age, and in some Satyrical Piece had dar'd to Expose a Maenius, &amp;c. without a Maecenas to Protect it, his Merit tho' never so Extraordinary, or Fancy or Stile were it never so pure, would all be too weak to defend it against the Critical Party, that found themselves Concern'd. </p>
        <p>This, I must humbly inform your Grace, I mean as to the General state of Satyrical Poets, without any reflection upon my own; the ensuing Scenes being design'd for diversion, and more proper to oblige an Audience to smile than frown; and tho' some perhaps, being affected with ill Humours, might pick out something to dislike, they generously agreed to incourage my Profit; and those that found themselves pleas'd, I thank my Stars, still far exceeded the others in number. </p>
        <p>Having at last so well acquitted it self on the Stage (tho' the thronging, imperfect Action, and worse than all, the faulty length, which I will never be guilty of again, render'd it little Diversion the first day) I confess, I could not stifle my Ambition of defiring this honour of your Graces Patronage, and as I have already always found a true Maecenas in your Illustrious Family: You, by a free and easie grant of so great a favour, an endearing sweetness in Behaviour, and graceful Condescension, have so added to my heap of Obligations, that I am dis●bled by ●xcess to instruct my Pen my heart's grateful Sentiments. </p>
        <p>All Praise is too low, when it approaches to your Graces Character; to say you are adorn'd with the Graceful Humility, <pb xml:id="ep000550-004-a"/>Eternal Honour, and Wisdom of your admir'd Grandfather; the Merit, Loyalty, and unequal'd Bravery of your Martial Father, whose Loss our Bleeding Country has never yet recover'd, i Praise indeed, but scarce aspiring to your Desert; your Glorious Campaign with his Sacred Majesty, and all your other Actions, during this Reign, sufficiently sounding your Applause, and ingaging every true Englishman, not only to Love, but Admire; amongst the Crowd of which, I think it my greatest Honour to be Ranked, esteeming no good Fortune greater than to be allow'd, </p>

        <head>A LETTER TO Mr. D'URFEY, Occasioned by his PLAY Called the Marriage-Hater Match'd. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Dear Friend, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I AM sensible the World will esteem a Friend too Partial a Judge of the performance of a Friend, yet since I am satisfied that I can divest my self of all prejudice against the Writings of even an Enemy, and allow him that praise which Justice requires; I think I may with the greater assurance say, that I will give no more favourable Censure on this Play of yours, than the severest Critick ought, if he but regulate himself according to the merits of the Cause, and will let Reason, and the Rules of Art weigh more with him, than the inconsiderate Railings of some of your Enemies, or the ungenerous malice of others; who, because they have attempted the Province of Comedy with less success, think to regain their Credit by Damning every one that has the Art of Pleasing beyond them; and since they cannot arrive to the Excellence of the Old way of Writing, would advance a new one of their own production, adapted to their undesigning Genius. </p>
        <p>But that which is the most strange is, that some of our Criticks, like Juglers, stare us in the face, and Palm upon us their own Fancy for the Opinion and Practices of the Ancients, and perswade us that a <hi>Bundle of Dialogues </hi>was all that was ever required to the framing a good Play; and that Terence had no other Excellence but the neatness of Phrase. Either they never read that Poet themselves, or suppose no body else did; otherwise I cannot imagine how they can maintain so gross a falsity, which may so easily be contradicted, by a short view of the Plots of his Comedies: I will begin with his first, called ●●dria. </p>
        <p>Pamphilus <hi>the Son of </hi>Simo, debauches Glyceriam <hi>the supposed Sister of </hi>Chrysis (<hi>a Native of the Island of </hi>Andros) <hi>she proves with Child, and he infinitely enamour'd <pb xml:id="ep000550-005-a"/>of her, promises her Marriage, with a full Resolution to be as good as his word; but </hi>Chremes <hi>won with the good Character and Parts of </hi>Pamphilus, <hi>proposes his Daughter </hi>Phileumena, <hi>for his Wife to </hi>Simo; <hi>the Old Men agree, and settle the Preliminaries▪ the Wedding day approaches, but the death of </hi>Chrysis <hi>the supposed Sister of </hi>Glycerium intervenes; Pamphilus, Simo, <hi>and others being at the Funeral, </hi>Glycerium <hi>distracted with grief, had flung her self in the </hi>Burning-Pile, <hi>had not her Lover </hi>Pamphilus <hi>run to her rescue; but he with such ardour embrac'd and comforted her, that the Old Gentleman his Father, and the rest of the Spectators had shrew'd suspicions tha●●his care of her proceeded from ill disguis'd Love</hi>; Chremes <hi>with a great deal of indignation breaks off the Match; but </hi>Simo, <hi>willing to find out the truth of the matter, conceals it from his Son, assuring him he must prepare to be immediately Marry'd. </hi>Pamphilus <hi>is at a great loss what to do, 'till his Servant </hi>Davus <hi>perswades him to dissemble a seeming readiness to comply with his Father's will; but this Policy of </hi>Davus <hi>had like to have spoil'd all, for on his Sons Compliance, </hi>Simo <hi>soon pacifies </hi>Chremes, <hi>and so set the Wedding on foot again, which </hi>Pamphilus <hi>finding no way to obstruct</hi>, Davus <hi>takes care to have the Child of </hi>Glycerium by Pamphilus <hi>expos'd to the view and knowledge of </hi>Chremes; <hi>who, upon that, once more in a great fury breaks off the match; but after a great deal of disturbance, all settles in quiet, to the content of all Parties. For </hi>Crito <hi>the next skin to </hi>Chrysis, <hi>arrives at </hi>Athens, <hi>to take Possession of her Goods as her lawful Heir, and discovers </hi>Glycerium <hi>to be </hi>Pasibula, <hi>the Daughter of </hi>Chremes, <hi>who overjoy'd at the discovery, gives her to </hi>Pamphilus <hi>for Wife, and </hi>Philumena to Charinus, <hi>who had long been in love with her, and who makes another Person in the Play</hi>. </p>
        <p>To have given a larger Argument of this Comedy, wou'd have been too tedious, since here is enough to ●atisfie any one that Terence had something else in his eye, besides the purity of his Language; otherwise Horace had with small reason given him, in his first Epistle of his second Book to Augustus, the distinctive Character, that his excellence lay in his Art. </p>
        <q>
          <l>Plautus ad exemplar siculi properare Epicharmi, </l>
          <l>Vincere Caecilius gravitate <hi>Terentius Arte.</hi>
          </l>
        </q>
        <p>I may spare the pains of taking notice of his Eunuch, or Adelphi, since the Town has seen them both, under the names of Bellamira, and the Squire of Alsatia. In his Heautontimorumenos, the several Designs of Chremes on Menedemus, and Syrus on both; the Discovery of Antiphila to be the Daughter of Chremes, and Sostrata, the Plot and Contrivance of Syrus to get the Money for Bacchis, and the disappointment of all these Designs, just when almost brought to perfection, will shew, that none that ever read him cou'd in justice say he had no Plot or Intrigue in his Plays: Nay, his Hecyra, which is said to have met with but little applause, and is doubted by some as spurious, is not without a good Plot, and several turns. But it would be superfluous to run through all particulars of this, and the other of Phormio, since by what is already said, there is nothing so evident, as that Terence took care of Plot as well as words, and was not less skil'd in the <foreign xml:lang="lat">Protasis, Epistatis, Catastasis</foreign>, and Catastrophe, than in the Dialogue, or Discourse. </p>
        <p>But were it true, that Terence wanted this perfection, as they wou'd have it <pb xml:id="ep000550-005-b"/>yet I can see no reason but that this Excellence should be valu'd; for the end of Comedy, being for Pleasure, as well as Instruction; that certainly which contributes most to the first, without prejudice to the latter, must be acknowledged an accomplishment not to be slighted. For the several neat turns of a Play keep the minds of the Auditory employ'd with expectation, hope, and desire, which all end in satisfaction, at the conclusion or unravelling of the Plot. But let the Moral or Instructive part be never so well writ, the Language never so fine, yet if the Action goes on without any Plot to divert us, we see through all at first sight, and grow weary before the Play is half done, for it gratifies none of our Passions, without which there can be no pleasure. </p>
        <p>By what has been said, will appear that you, Sir, keep up to the noble Standard of the Antients, and tho' it be one of the greatest and most di●●icult parts of the hard task of a Comick Poet, yet you have always been very fortunate in it, especially in this last Comedy of yours, called the <hi>Marriage-Hater Match'd</hi>. I must needs say I think is your best, and far beyond that of the <hi>Boarding School</hi>; the turns are so surprizing, and natural, that I may say without flattery, 'tis not in the power of any Person to out-do them. The wit of Sir Philip and the Widow, like sprightly Blood in youthful Veins, runs through the whole Play, giving it a Noble and vigorous Life; you have farther observ'd that decorum of Poetick Justice, in making Sir Philip be caught in his own Plot, to deceive another, and marry her, who had so well merited him, as Ph●be, alias Lovewell, who made a very pretty Figure on the Stage. Such a variety of Humours and Characters I have seldom seen in one Play; and those so truly drawn, that they all look like principal Parts; and that which is more, they are all New, and so worthy observation: that indeed I admire the humour of Madam <hi>La Pupsey </hi>has been so long neglected, since grown to so general a custom, that the Lap Dog takes up all the thoughts of the fair Sex, whilst the faithful Lover sighs in vain, and at a distance unregarded. This was an usurpation on our Prerogative, and had been born too long. The humour of <hi>Van Grin </hi>is new, and not so unpleasant, but that it deserves to be more taken notice of, being very material to set off the rest. </p>
        <p>Then the Skittishness of Mrs. Margery, and the ●reakishness of Berenice, are faults too general not to be exposed; besides, who is there so wedded to Melancholy, like the Son of the Emperour Philip the First, but must give way to Laughter, to see the pleasant Humour of Bias, and the extraordinary diversion of Solon. </p>
        <p>I am sensible that Callow was so like the Life, that the <hi>Rot me </hi>Sparks openly declar'd their dissatisfaction at the Satyr: but 'tis a sign it hit them, when they complain of the wound. 'Tis a base and ill-natur'd, as well as ignorant Age of Chriticism, when the Vertues of a Play shall be Arraigned as Defects; for if these Gentlemen understood either the Original, or end of Comedy, they wou'd never quarrel with the Satyr of it, since from its beginning 'twas design'd to correct Vice, and Folly, by exposing them. </p>
        <p>Little had the Poetick harmony of Orpheus contributed to the benefit of Mankind, by calling the Humane Salvages from their rude way of living, to Society, if Comedy had not come in to reform those abuses which grew from Conversation; Necessity indeed was its Mother, for the Follies and Vices of <pb xml:id="ep000550-006-a"/>the City as well as the Countrey, grew beyond all other Redress, which made the Country People (to whom we owe too the Beucolic Poetry) when they Celebrated their Festivals to <hi>Apollo Nomius</hi>, for the preservation of the Fruits and Products of the Earth, in songs and Madrigals recriminate on those that had abus'd them: From this beginning, they made another step, and in the night time they frequently entred the City, and expos'd such of the more Opulent and Remarkable Citizens, as by their Vanities or Oppressions had render'd themselves justly odious; here they proceeded to a particular ennumeration of the wrongs they had received, and the ills which they had suffer'd under. The Magistrates and Government observing that this Course was more Powerful than the Laws for the restraining of Vice, and that the fear of the loss of their Reputation, kept those from ill, that cou'd perhaps evade the Penalties of the Laws by Money, or Favour; granted a formal License for the performing this in the day time in Verse, from thence Comedy immediately derives it self, which at first, like our Lam●oons, fear'd not to mention the very names of those it wou'd expose. Cratinus was the first that divided into distinct Parts, or Acts; and Aristop●anes brought it to a more Regular and Compleat Form; the liberty and bold assurance of this first state of <hi>Comedy, Horace </hi>in his Fourth Satyr of his First Book, shews us in these Five Verses. </p>
        <q>
          <l>Eupolis, atque Cratinus, Aristophanesque Poetae </l>
          <l>Atque alli quorum Comaedia Pri●●● virorum est, </l>
          <l>Si quis erat dignus describi, quod Malus aut fur </l>
          <l>Quod Maechus foret, aut Sicarius, aut alioqui </l>
          <l>Famosus, multâ cum libertate notabatur. </l>
        </q>
        <p>But the Thirty Tyrants of Athens being themselves so guilty of all manner of Vices, thought they cou'd not better secure themselves in the practice of them, than to gain a Liberty for others to come in for their share, that by the multitud● of Offenders, they might be the less observed; but they knew no way to effect their desire, but by taking away this Liberty of Comedy, which kept the Citizens in awe, and within the bounds of Justice; wherefore they established a Law, that any one that should find himself expos'd on the Stage, might sue for Satisfaction. This pleas'd the Wealthy ones so well, that after Expulsion of these Usurpers, Athens preferred this Sanction which so much indulged their Inclinations; so that from this time the Chorus was left off in Comedies, for in them chiefly was names of particular Persons, with their Crimes recited. Horace seems to approve of this Alteration, in these words, </p>
        <q>
          <l>Successit vetus his Comaedia non sine multâ </l>
          <l>Laude, sed in vitium libertas excidit, &amp; vim </l>
          <l>
            <foreign xml:lang="lat">Dignam lege regi</foreign>; lex est accepta Chorusque </l>
          <l>Turpiter oblicuit, sublato fure nocendi. </l>
        </q>
        <p>But still the Business of Comedy was to expose the general Vices and Follies of the Age, under feign'd Names: So that to eccept against your Play, for the Satyr of it only, shews your Enemies are wretchedly put to't to find a real fault in't, when they condemn that which is an Excellence, without which, the <pb xml:id="ep000550-006-b"/>Poet gains but half his point, losing the Utile, which is an essential part of his Design and Duty. </p>
        <p>But if you cou'd meet with generous Enemies, they would forgive those Errors their quicker sight might discover, for the Beauties and delightful Entertainment of the Lyric part, the Songs I mean, in which I think there is none will (I am sure none ought to) dispute your Title to the Preheminence. </p>
        <p>If there be any fault in this Play, 'tis that which few are guilty of; that is, there are too many good Characters, too full of Humour, a very pardonable failing, which only proceeds from Vari●ty, the life of Pleasure and Wit, tho' that gave it the disadvantage of seeming too long the first days Acting, tho' the Stage's being throng'd with Spectators, did not a little contribute to the imperfect Acting of it, which accidental Misfortunes concurring with the Endeavours of an opposite Faction, must needs have damn'd it, had it not by the Force and Vigour of its own Worth, rais'd it self the second day with the general Applause of all that saw it. Horace thinks it a sufficient proof of a good Poem, if it will bear a second view; <q>
            <l>Haec placuit semel, haec bis repetita placebit. </l>
          </q>But the Marriage-hater went further, and in spight of all the disadvantages is labour'd under of Action and Audience, pleas'd on, after several times Repetition, and will as long as <hi>Wit, Humour</hi>, and Plot shall be esteem'd as necessary Materials to compose a good Play. Which have given me so great a Satisfaction both in the Reading and Seeing, that I must beg you, to give me leave, to attest it to the World, </p>
