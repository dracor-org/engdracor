        <head>TO HER Royal Highness THE DUTCHESS. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Madam, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>AFTER having a great while wisht to write something that might be worthy to lay at your Highnesses Feet, and finding it impossible: Since the World has been so kind to me to Judge of this Poem to my advantage, as the most pardonable fault which I have made in its kind; I had sinn'd against my self, if I had not chosen this Opportunity to implore (what my Ambition is most fond of) your Favour and Protection. </p>
        <p>For though Fortune would not so far bless my endeavours, as to encourage them with your Royal Highnesses presence, when this came into the World: Yet, I cannot but declare it was my design and hopes it might have been your Divertisement in that happy season, when you return'd again to chear all those eyes that had before wept for your Departure, and enliven all hearts that had droopt for your Absence: When <pb xml:id="ep000664-003-a"/>Wit ought to have pay'd it's Choicest Tributes in, and Joy have known no Limits, then I hop'd my little Mite would not have been rejected; though my ill Fortune was too hard for me, and I lost a greater Honour, by your Royal Highnesses Absence, than all the Applauses of the World besides can make me Reparation for. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, I thought my self not quite unhappy, so long as I had hopes this way yet to recompence my disappointment past: When I consider'd also that Poetry might claim right to a little share in your Favour: For Tasso, and Ariosto, some of the best, have made their Names Eternal, by transmitting to after-Ages the Glory of your Ancestors: And under the spreading of that shade, where two of the best have planted their Lawrels, how Honoured should I be, who am the worst, if but a branch might grow for me. </p>
        <p>I dare not think of offering at any thing in this Address, that might look like a Panegyrick, for fear lest when I have done my best, the World should Condemn me, for saying too little, and you your self check me, for medling with a Task unfit for my Talent. </p>
        <p>For the description of Vertues, and Perfections so rare as yours are, ought to be done by as deliberate, as skillful a Hand; the Features must be drawn very fine, to be like, hasty dawbing would but spoil the Picture, and make it so unnatural, as must want false lights to set it off: <pb xml:id="ep000664-003-b"/>And your Vertue can receive no more Lustre from Praises, than your Beauty can be improv'd by Art; which as it Charms the bravest Prince that ever amaz'd the World with his Virtue: So let but all other Hearts enquire into themselves, and then Judge how it ought to be prais'd. </p>
        <p>Your Love too, as none but that great Heroe who has it could deserve it, and therefore, by a particular Lot from Heav'n, was destin'd to so extraordinary a blessing, so matchless for itself, and so wondrous for it's Constancy, shall be remembred to your Immortal Honour, when all other Transactions of the Age you live in shall be forgotten. </p>
        <p>But I forget that I am to ask Pardon for the fault I have been all this while Committing: wherefore I beg your Highness to forgive me this presumption, and that you will be pleas'd to think well of one who cannot help resolving with all the Actions of Life, to endeavour to deserve it: Nay more, I would beg, and hope it may be granted, that I may through yours never want an Advocate in his Favour, whose Heart, and Mind, you have so entire a share in; it is my only Portion and my Fortune; I cannot but be happy, so long as I have but hopes I may enjoy it, and I must be Miserable, should it ever be my ill Fate to lose it. </p>
        <p>This, with Eternal wishes for your Royal Highnesses Content, Happiness, and Prosperity, in all Humility is presented by </p>

        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <l>TO you, great Iudges in this Writing Age, </l>
        <l>The sons of Wit, and Patrons of the Stage, </l>
        <l>With all those humble thoughts, which still have sway'd </l>
        <l>His Pride, much doubting, trembling and affraid </l>
        <l>Of what is to his want of merit due, </l>
        <l>And aw'd by every Excellence in you, </l>
        <l>The Author sends to beg you would be kind, </l>
        <l>And spare those many faults you needs must find. </l>
        <l>You to whom Wit a Common Foe is grown, </l>
        <l>The thing ye scorn, and publickly disown; </l>
        <l>Though now perhaps y'are here for other ends, </l>
        <l>He swears to me, you ought to be his Friends: </l>
        <l>For he ne're call'd ye yet insipid Tools; </l>
        <l>Nor wrote one line to tell you ye were Fools: </l>
        <l>But says of Wit ye have so large a store, </l>
        <l>So very much, you never will have more. </l>
        <l>He ne're with Libel treated yet the Town, </l>
        <l>The names of Honest men bedawb'd and shown, </l>
        <l>Nay, never once lampoon'd the harmless life </l>
        <l>Of Suburb Virgin, or of City Wife: </l>
        <l>Satyr's the effect of Poetries disease; </l>
        <l>Which, sick of a lew'd Age, she vents for Ease, </l>
        <l>But now her only strife should be to please. </l>
        <l>Since of ill Fate the baneful Cloud's withdrawn; </l>
        <l>And happiness again begins to dawn, </l>
        <l>Since back with Joy and Triumph he is come, </l>
        <l>That always drove Fears hence, he're brought 'em home. </l>
        <l>Oft has he plough'd the boist'rous Ocean o're, </l>
        <l>Yet ne're more welcome to the longing shoar, </l>
        <l>Not when he brought home Victories before. </l>
        <l>For then fresh Laurels flourisht on his Brow, </l>
        <l>And he comes Crown'd with Olive-branches now. </l>
        <l>Receive him! Oh receive him as his Friends; </l>
        <l>Embrace the blessings which be Recommends; </l>
        <l>Such quiet as your Foes shall ne're destroy; </l>
        <l>Then shake off Fears, and clap your hands for Ioy. </l>

        <l>To whose protection might I safely go? </l>
        <l>Is there amongst you no good Nature? No. </l>
        <l>What should I do? should I the Godly seek, </l>
        <l>And go a Conventicling twice a Week? </l>
        <l>Quit the lewd Stage, and its prophane pollution, </l>
        <l>Affect each Form and Saint-like Institution, </l>
        <l>So draw the Brethren all to Contribution? </l>
        <l>Or shall I (is I guess the Poet may </l>
        <l>Within these three days) fairly run away? </l>
        <l>No, to some City Lodgings I'll retire, </l>
        <l>Seem very grave, and privacy desire: </l>
        <l>Till I am thought some Heiress rich in Lands, </l>
        <l>Fled to escape a cruel Guardian's hands; </l>
        <l>Which may produce a Story worth the telling, </l>
        <l>Of the next Sparks that go a Fortune-stealing. </l>
