          <salute>Sir, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THinking of amends to expres my gratefulnes for those many Favours You have shown me, I could pitch on no other more fit than this my <pb xml:id="ep000115-003-a"/>Genius prompted me, it was well thought on, if Yours give it the like acceptance I am happy: for Workes of this Nature, I dare affirme, have beene acceptable to most men, contemn'd by few, unlesse it bee those of the more Stoicall disposition, whose rigid Fronts cry downe all things, but what themselves approve of. For this Worke of it selfe, I may say thus much without blushing, it received the rights of a good Play, when it was Acted, which were Applauses &amp; Commendations, whether it merited them or not, I leave to your Judgement: the Nature of the Worke, being History; it consists <pb xml:id="ep000115-003-b"/>of many parts, not walking in one direct path, of Comedy, or Tragedy, but having a larger field to trace, which me thinks should yeeld more pleasure to the Reader, Novelty and Variety being the only Objects these our Times are taken with: the Tragedy may be too dull and solid, the Comedy too sharpe and bitter; but a well mixt portion of either, doubtlesse would make the sweetest harmony. But this Worke as it is, and my wishes that all defects in it, to my desires, and your content were supplide, I commend to your perusall, my selfe, it, and resting, to bee commanded by you in all friendly Offices, </p>

            <l>The Parents of that boy begetting him, </l>
