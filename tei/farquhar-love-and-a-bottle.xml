        <head>To the Right Honourable, PEREGRINE, Lord Marquiss of Carmarthen, &amp;c. </head>
        <p>My Lord, </p>
        <p>BEing equally a stranger to your Lordship, and the whole Nobility of this Kingdom, something of a natural impulse and aspiring motion in my inclinations, has prompted me, tho I hazzard a presumption, to declare my Respect. And be the Success how it will, I am vain of nothing in this piece, but the choice of my Patron; I shall be so far thought a judicious Author, whose principal business is to design his Works an offering to the greatest Honour and Merit. </p>
        <p>I cannot here, my Lord, stand accused of any sort of Adulation, but to my self, because Compliments due to Merit return upon the giver, and the only flattery is to my self, whilst I attempt your Lordships praise. I dare make no essay on your Lordships youthful Bravery and Courage, because such is always guarded with Modesty, but shall venture to present you some lines on this Subject, which the world will undoubtedly apply to your Lordship. </p>
        <lg>
          <l>Courage, the highest gift, that scorns to bend </l>
          <l>To mean devices for a sordid end. </l>
          <l>Courage&#8212; an independant spark from Heaven's bright Throne, </l>
          <l>By which the Soul stands rais'd, triumphant, high, alone. </l>
          <l>Great in it self, not praises of the crowd, </l>
          <l>Above all vice, it stoops not to be proud. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000575-003-a"/>
          <l>Courage, the mighty attribute of powers above, </l>
          <l>By which those great in War, are great in Love. </l>
          <l>The spring of all brave Acts is seated here, </l>
          <l>As falshoods draw their sordid birth from fear. </l>
        </lg>
        <p>The best and noblest part of mankind pay homage to Royalty, what veneration then is due to those Vertues and Endowments which even engag'd the respect of Royalty it self, in the person of one of the greatest Emperours in the World, who chose your Lordship not only as a Companion, but a Conductor. </p>
        <p>He wanted the Fire of such a Britton to animate his cold Russians, and wou'd therefore choose you his Leader in War, as in Travel: he knew the Fury of the Turk cou'd be only stopt by an English Nobleman, as the Power of France was by an English King. A sense of this greatness which might deter others, animates me to Address your Lordship; resolv'd that my first Muse shou'd take an high and daring flight, I aspir'd to your Lordships Protection for this trifle, which I must own my self now proud of, affording me this opportunity of Humbly declaring my self, </p>
        <p>My Lord, </p>
        <p>Your Lordships most devoted Servant, </p>
        <p>G. Farquhar. </p>

        <lg>
          <l>AS stubborn Atheists, who disdain'd to pray, </l>
          <l>Repent, tho late, upon their dying day, </l>
          <l>So in their pangs, most Author's rack'd with fears, </l>
          <l>Implore your mercy in our suppliant pray'rs. </l>
          <l>But our new Author has no Cause maintained, </l>
          <l>Let him not lose what he has never gained. </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Love and a Bottle </hi>are his peaceful arms? </l>
          <l>Ladies, and Gallants, have not these some Charms. </l>
          <l>For Love, all mankind to the Fair must sue, </l>
          <l>And Sirs, the Bottle, he presents to you. </l>
          <l>Health to the Play, <hi>(drinks.</hi>) e'en let it fairly pass, </l>
          <l>Sure none sit here that will refuse their glass. </l>
          <l>Othere's a damning Soldier&#8212; let me think&#8212; </l>
          <l>He looks as he were sworn&#8212; to What!&#8212; to drink. <hi>(drinks</hi>. </l>
          <l>Come on then; foot to foot be boldly set, </l>
          <l>And our young Author's new Commission wet. </l>
          <l>He and his Bottle here attend their doom, </l>
          <l>From you the Poets Hellicon must come; </l>
          <l>If he has any foes, to make amends, </l>
          <l>He gives his service <hi>(drinks</hi>) sure you now are friends. </l>
          <l>No Critick here will he provoke to fight, </l>
          <l>The day be theirs, he only begs his Night; </l>
          <l>Pray pledge him now, secur'd from all abuse, </l>
          <l>Then name the health you love, let none refuse, </l>
          <l>But each man's Mistress be the Poet's Muse. </l>

          <l>I Come not here, our Poets Fate to see, </l>
          <l>He and his Play may both be damn'd for me. </l>
          <l>No; Royal Theatre, I come to Mourn for thee. </l>
          <l>And must these Structures then untimely fall </l>
          <l>Whilst the other House stands and gets the Devil and all? </l>
          <l>Must still kind Fortune through all Weathers steer 'em? </l>
          <l>And Beauties bloom their spight of <foreign xml:lang="lat">Edax, Rerum</foreign>. </l>
          <l>
            <foreign xml:lang="lat">Vivitur Ingenio</foreign>, that damn'd Motto there <hi>[Looking up at it</hi>. </l>
          <l>Seduc'd me first to be a Wicked Player. </l>
          <l>Hard Times indeed, Oh Tempora! Oh Mores! </l>
          <l>I knew that Stage must down where not one whore is. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>But can you have the hearts tho'?&#8212; (pray now speak) </l>
          <l>After all our Services to let us break, </l>
          <l>You cannot do't unless the Devil's in ye, </l>
          <l>What Arts, what Merit ha'n't we us'd to win ye? </l>
          <l>First to divert ye with some new French strowlers; </l>
          <l>We brought ye <hi>Bona Sere's, Barba Colar's. [Mocking the late singers. </hi>
          </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>When their Male Throats no longer drew your Money. </l>
          <l>We got ye an Eunuch's Pipe, <hi>Seignior Rampony</hi>. </l>
          <l>That Beardless Songster we cou'd ne're make much on; </l>
          <l>The Females found a damn'd Blot in his Scutcheon. </l>
          <l>An Italian now we've got of mighty Fame, </l>
          <l>
            <hi>Don Segismondo Fideli</hi>.&#8212; There's Musick-in-his Name, </l>
          <l>His voice is like the Musick of the Spheres </l>

          <l>He's a handsome fellow too, look brisks and trim. </l>
          <l>If he don't take ye, Then the Devil take him. </l>
          <l>Besides least our white faces always mayn't delight ye; </l>
          <l>We've Pickt up Gypsies now to please or fright ye. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Lastly to make our House more Courtlier shine; </l>
          <l>As Travel does the Men of Mode refine, </l>
          <l>So our Stage Hero's did their Tour design. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000575-004-b"/>
          <l>To mend their Manners and course English Feeding, </l>
          <l>They went to Ireland to improve their Breeding: </l>
          <l>Yet for all this, we still are at a loss, </l>
          <l>Oh <hi>Collier! Collier</hi>! Thou'st frighted away Miss <hi>C&#8212; s </hi>
          </l>
          <l>She to return our Foreigner's Complizance </l>
          <l>At Cupid's call, has made a Trip to France. </l>
          <l>Love's <hi>Fire Arm's </hi>here are since not worth a sous. </l>
          <l>We've lost the only Touch-hole of our House. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Losing that Jewel gave us a Fatal blow: </l>
          <l>Well, if thin Audience must <hi>Jo. Haynes </hi>undo, </l>
          <l>Well, if 'tis decreed, Nor can thy Fate, O Stage </l>
          <l>Resist the Vows of this obdurate Age, </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>I'll then grow wiser, leave off Playing the Fool, </l>
          <l>And Hire this Play-House for a Boarding-School. </l>
          <l>D'ye think the Maids won't be in a sweet Condition </l>
          <l>When they are Under Jo. Haynes's Grave Tuition </l>
          <l>They'll have no occasion then I'm sure to Play </l>
