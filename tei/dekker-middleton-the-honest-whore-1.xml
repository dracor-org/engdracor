He (according to the mildenesse of his breast) entertained the lordes, and with courtly discourse beguiled the time (as much as a Cittizen might doe:) to conclude, they were hungry lordes, for there came no meate in; their stomackes were plainely gulld, and their teeth deluded, and (if anger could have seizd a man) there was matter enough yfaith to vex any citizen in the world, if hee were not too much made a foole by his wife. </p>
