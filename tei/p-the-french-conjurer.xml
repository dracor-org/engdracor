        <head>THE BOOKSELLER TO THE READER. </head>
        <p>AS Prefaces are commonly nothing to the purpose, even so little an Author as a Bookseller may venture to write one. And to shew you that this is as modish an Epistle as most are, I do assure you, it has as little in it as any you ever read. In the first place I have nothing to say about the Play: for as the Author stood upon no Reputation in the Acting of it, so he has none to defend in the Publication. <pb xml:id="ep000680-005-a"/>Nor has he any thing to say about the Critiques: for as he never intends to trouble the Stage agen, he has no occasion of begging their Favours in Reversion, and securing of Votes before-hand. And for his Brother Poets, he has nothing to say to them neither; no, not so much as to rail at them. And last of all, the Author has nothing to say for himself, nor I for him; and so I am </p>

        <lg>
          <l>Since 'tis the Womens Play, I hope you will excuse </l>
          <l>Whate're we bring, because it comes from us. </l>
          <l>Consider what the Stage has done, and Plays, </l>
          <l>Of all things, most deserve your love and praise. </l>
          <l>And, Gallants, though you are but seldom good, </l>
          <l>Yet to us women most of all you shou'd. </l>
          <l>No sooner comes a Beauty here in play, </l>
          <l>But strait your Coach and six takes her away. </l>
          <l>And you who cull the Flock, should be so kinde </l>
          <l>To comfort the forlorn you leave behinde. </l>
          <l>Besides, no sooner are your follies known </l>
          <l>But Fop on Stage is strait so lively shewn, </l>
          <l>Nay, and his Picture too so ugly done, </l>
          <l>'Twould fright him into sense. Thus Plays are writ </l>
          <l>To breed you Mistrisses, and teach you Wit: </l>
          <l>And, Gallants, 'twere ill-natured, I protest, </l>
          <l>To like the Birds, and yet destroy the Nest. </l>
          <l>But if in spight you'll still grow worse and worse, </l>
          <l>I will e'ne give you this one hearty Curse: </l>
          <l>May all the mighty Sums you ever sent </l>
          <l>Your Mistrisses, be on your Valets spent; </l>
          <l>And when at Nine months end the Miss grows sickly, </l>
          <l>May none of all the Brats you own be like ye. </l>

          <p>Well, thus it is: Your dear Leonora, and the fool her Husband, takes it for granted that I am Servant to my Lady Abbess of the Covent of St. Sylvester; and under that character I have been several times with them for gold-wyre for the use of the Covent, as I pretend. The advantage they hope from the custom of the Covent by my means, gains me a very favourable reception. </p>

          <speaker>Claud. </speaker>

          <p>Well then, if I do not deliver this Fort, with all the Out-works belonging to it into your hands, and before this night be over, may I never bring kinde couple together again, but live as poor and wretched as a Confessor in a Garison, and as shabby as a Bawd in a Pillory. </p>

          <speaker>Claud. </speaker>
          <p>I fear, Sabina, you will finde it a more difficult piece of service than you yet apprehend: for she is so tainted with that morose Spanish gravitie of ours, that she put the Slight upon the Charms of Treats and Presents. </p>

          <speaker>Sab. </speaker>

        <sp xml:id="ep000680-e1650">
          <speaker>Sab. </speaker>
          <p>Why, Senior, 'tis the Land of Priviledge for women: the very daughter of a Laundress there, after she bears the honourable title of a Miss, expects, nay commands Attendance and Equipage suitable to a Dutchess. And for the men, they are such lovers of change of Faces, that 'tis thought if there were a Colony of Lapland, Witches transported thither, for the sweet sin of Variety, they would sometime be courted for Beauties. And now I talk of Variety, how do you think, Senior, I might pass there? </p>

        <sp xml:id="ep000680-e1690">
          <speaker>Claud. </speaker>
          <p>You are pleasant, Sabina; but all this adds nothing to my affairs: therefore prethy remove the Scene from England into Spain, and tell me, shall my dear Leonora </p>

        <sp xml:id="ep000680-e1760">
          <speaker>Sab. </speaker>
          <p>Well, Senior, and now you put me in minde of England, I cannot chuse but pity your case, that such a noble young rich Don as you should be put to that toil, that charge, and that trouble, for the obtaining such a paltry creature as a Citizens Wife. An Intrigue with a Citizens Wife in England, is as common as a Frolick at a Carnival here, and has full as little danger in't. There's no locking up their Wives, nor engaging whole Families to punish their frailties. If a Gallant be caught in the fact by a Wives Brother, nay, or a Husband himself, he may as easie come off for Adultery there, as a man may for Murther here. The Gallant gets but out of the way for sanctuary, and the Wife gets her Parents to make up the Breach, at worst, but to pay a new Portion, and all is well. The kinde Cit uses his Wife that wrongs him, as he does the man that robs him; he had rather have his stolen goods quietly agen, than to hang the thief and loose them. </p>
