          <l>Author, or Poet) nor beg to be installd </l>
          <l>Sir Lawreat) has sent me out t'invite </l>
          <l>Your fancies to a full and cleane delight: </l>
          <l>And bids me tell you, That though he be none </l>
          <l>Of those, whose towring Muses scale the Throne </l>
          <l>Of Kings, yet his familiar mirth's as good, </l>
          <l>When tis by you approv'd and understood. </l>
          <l>As if h' had writ strong lines, and had the fate, </l>
          <l>Of other Fools for medling with the State. </l>
          <l>Readers and Audients make good Playes or Books, </l>
          <l>Tis appetite makes Dishes, tis not Cooks. </l>
          <l>But let me tell you, though you have the power, </l>
          <l>To kill or save; They're Tyrants that devoure, </l>
          <l>And Princes that preserve: He does not ayme, </l>
          <l>So much at praise, as pardon; nor does claime </l>
          <l>Lawrell, but Money; Bayes will buy no Sack, </l>
          <l>And Honour fills no belly, cloaths no back. </l>
          <l>And therefore you may see his maine intent </l>
          <l>Is his owne welfare, and your merriment. </l>
          <l>Then often come, 'twill make us and him the wetter, </l>
          <l>Wee'l drown the faults of this, in one that's better. </l>
