        <l>I Smile to think how every One that's here, </l>
        <l>Expects Tartuffe or Scrupple should appear; </l>
        <l>Who with Religions Twang and Mouth a-splay </l>
        <l>Should Conventicle now instead of play: </l>
        <l>But 't is the other house, you've lost your way. </l>
        <l>Here's nothing like a holy Reformation, </l>
        <l>Nor Drum, nor Trumpet, though so much in Fashion </l>
        <l>In all admired Playes of th' new Translation. </l>
        <l>Nay can you Guess what our dull Rogue should mean? </l>
        <l>He ha's not left us Room for Gaudy Scene; </l>
        <l>Which uses to amuse you for a time, </l>
        <l>Whil'st Non-sence safely glides away in Rime. </l>
        <l>I'le swear I had advis'd him for the best, </l>
        <l>To Lard it with fat Song or bawdy jeast </l>
        <l>Or write in Verse and huffe the Gods at least. </l>
        <l>But he was humoursome and bid me say, </l>
        <l>He was for plodding in the Antient way: </l>
        <l>Yet he would if this did not please our Friends, </l>
        <l>In Rime and Non-sence strive to make amends. </l>
        <l>If we procur'd Noise, Clothes, Scenes, Songs and Dance, </l>
        <l>His Siege, or Conquest he can have from France. </l>

            <p>In earnest Pedro, thou hast been as musing this two hours, as a Polititian would be thought to be, when he thinks of just nothing; sometimes you stand cross arm'd, or biting of your nails; by and by nod, as if it was concluded: then on the sudden scratch your head, as if some prodigious accident had ruin'd the conquest of the Indies. </p>

They ne're consider should we all live, as they do now, the World would be undone, I tell thee Pedro, if it were not for this debauchery, that kicks up our heels in convenient time, it would not hold half of us. </p>

These Gimcracks if they once come towards fifteen are so gamesome, there's no riding them without a curb, nay then 'tis ten to one but that they fling the first Adventurer out of the Saddle too. The Divel's in them I think, I'me sure in my young days. But I'de as good stop I shall be tempted to lie else. The truth is I hate all young women that are fair and there's reason for't; if we old ones get a good look once a twelvemonth, be sure the next young one that passes by robs us. </p>

            <p>TIs strange that we can fasten no such thing as honor upon the Sex, whereas a man's lies every where. Twinge him by the nose, his honour's there, and presently must be redeem'd. </p>
            <p>Kick him, and 'tis remov'd to's backside, and must be engaged. </p>
            <p>But this of woman-kind is really nothing. For if one unmarried chance to kick up her heeles, the reproach returns upon the family. </p>
            <p>Or if a wife prove gamesome more than ordinary, shee's thought a wit, and cunning; and 'tis the husband's branded with the name of scorn. </p>
            <p>Now should I go kill Pisauro to redeem my honour: and if I do, die honourably by an Executioner, or fly my Country: Or if I fall my self, they'l cry there died a silly cuckold, worth the while. I thank my stars I'me less nice in these points, and have found out a safer way. </p>

        <l>He lookes about him with a scornful frown, </l>
        <l>Then picks his Favourite out and sits him down. </l>
        <l>Take me how is't? Have you seen our new Play? </l>
        <l>Yes faith; and how? a half Crown thrown away, </l>

        <l>'Twas some Raw Fop: Then proudly stares about; </l>
        <l>Then shrugs and whispers, laughs, then swears aloud. </l>
        <l>The whilst there's silence kept by all the Croud. </l>
        <l>At length he nods and cocks, is heard to say, </l>
        <l>D— me 'tis true, and thus he damns the Play, </l>
        <l>Rises, lookes big and combs, then goes his Way. </l>

        <l>Foes unto every thing that's not their own. </l>
        <l>And rather too, than that shall want applause, </l>
        <l>They'l clap themselves and that way gain the cause. </l>
        <l>By such like Arts they rule the stage and you, </l>
        <l>And what was Favour first, now claim as due. </l>
        <l>For shame use your Authority and free </l>
        <l>Your selves from these usurpers Tyranny, </l>
        <l>Ne're wait their censure more, but let them know </l>
        <l>You have the power that they pretended to. </l>
        <l>They wheadle you to clap bad plays they write: </l>
        <l>To be reveng'd do you clap this to night. </l>
