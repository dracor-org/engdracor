And may it please you to walke, I will tell you no wonderfull storie. This place, whereon you are now aduanced (by the mightie power of Poetrie, and the helpe of a faith, that can remoue mountaynes) is the Arcadian hill CYLLENE, the place, where my selfe was both begot, and borne; and of which I am frequently call'd CYLLENIVS: Vnder yond' purslane tree stood sometime my cradle. Where, now, behold my mother MAIA, sitting in the pride of her plentie, gladding the aire with her breath, and cheering the spring with her smiles. At her feet, the blushing AVRORA, who, with her rosie hand, casteth her honie dewes on those sweeter herbs, accompanied with that gentle winde, FAVONIVS, whose subtile spirit, in the breathing forth, FLORA makes into flowers, and sticks them in the grasse, as if shee contended to haue the imbroyderie of the <pb n="881" xml:id="ep000100-467-b"/>earth, richer then the cope of the skie. Here, for her moneth, the yeerely delicate May keepes state; and from this Mount, takes pleasure to display these valleyes, yon'd lesser hills, those statelier edifices, and towers, that seeme enamour'd so farre off, and are rear'd on end, to behold her, as if their vtmost obiect were her beauties. Hither the Dryads of the valley, and Nymphs of the great riuer come euery morning, to taste of her fauors; and depart away with laps fill'd with her bounties. But, see! vpon your approch their pleasures are instantly remitted. The birds are hush'd, ZEPHYRE is still, the MORNE forbeares her office, FLORA is dumbe, and herselfe amazed, to behold two such maruailes, that doe more adorne place, then shee can time; Pardon, your Maiestie, the fault, for it is that hath caus'd it; and till they can collect their spirits, thinke silence, and wonder the best adoration. </p>

Now, I do, and acknowledge it you sole, and no lesse the diuine benefit. If my desire to delight you, might not diuert to your trouble, I would intreat your eyes to a new, and strange spectacle; a certaine sonne of mine, whom the Arcadians call a god, howsoeuer the rest of the world receiue him: It is the horned PAN, whom in the translated figure of a goate I begot on the faire Spartan PENELOPE; MAY, let both your eares, and lookes forgiue it: These are but the lightest escapes of our Deities. And, it is better in me, to preuent his rusticke impudence, by my blushing acknowledgement, then, anon, by his rude, and not insolent clayme, be enforced to confesse him. Yonder hee keepes, and with him the wood Nymphes, whose leader he is in rounds, and daunces, to this Syluane musique. The place, about which they skip, is the fount of laughter, or BACCHVS spring; whose statue is aduanced on the top; and from whose pipes, at an obseru'd howre of the day, there flowes a lustie liquor, that hath the present vertue to expell sadnesse; and within certaine minutes after it is tasted, force all the myrth of the spleene into the face. Of this is PAN the Guardian. Loe! the fountain begins to run, but the Nymphes at your sight are fled. PAN, and his Satyres wildly stand at gaze. I will approach, and question him: vouchsafe your eare, and forgiue his behauiour, which (euen to me, that am his parent) will no doubt be rude ynough, though otherwise full of salt, which, except my presence did temper, might turne to be gall, and bitternesse; but that shall charme him. </p>
