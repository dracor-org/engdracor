        <head>To the righte worshipfull Maister Gilbert Gerrard, the Queenes Maiesties Attourney Generall, Thomas Churchyard Gent. sendeth this signe of good will, and wisheth encrease of worthy fame. </head>
        <p>HAVING a desire (right Worshipfull) to continue in youre fauour and amitie, I deuised sundry ways to giue you some cause of recreation, amid the multitude of youre graue studies, and weightie affayres, and knowing that no one thing is more welcome to a worthy witte, than the vnderstanding of matter, wherein the dutie of good subiectes is expressed, and the greatnesse of good minds is made manifest, <pb xml:id="ep000348-003-a"/>I haue presented you with a little Booke, that makes not only report of the noble receiuing of the Queenes Maiestie into Suffolke and Norffolke, but also of the good order, great cheere, and charges that hir highnesse subiectes were at, during hir abode in those parties. And bycause I sawe most of it, or heard it so credibly rehearsed, as I know it to be true, I meane to make it a mirror and shining glasse, that al the whole land may loke into, or vse it for an example in all places (where the Prince commeth) to our posteritie heereafter for euer. For in very deede, if the dutifull vsage of Suffolke and Norffolke had not surmounted in greatnesse &amp; goodnesse any fiue Sheeres in England, for hospitalitie, brauerie, and franke dealing, I had not made mention of these causes, nor written so large a discourse of their behauioures, and bountifull manner of dutie: but finding these two Sheeres so well furnished of Gentlemen, and so flourishing, <pb xml:id="ep000348-003-b"/>and ready to attend in time of triumph, on hir that is oure triumph and earthly felicitie, I can do no lesse, but with immortall fame, sounde their prayses, and vse my penne to their greate glorye and thankes, as a guerdon due for their worthy &amp; honest dezerts, hoping that euery other Sheere, where the Queenes highnesse hath not bin, will rather striue to follow this lanterne when occasion is offered, than any way thinke me affectionate, or that I haue partially proceeded in this exercise of pen. And nowe righte Worshipfull, if you muse why I do enterlard this discourse with some suche wordes or sentences, as may seeme to degresse from my purposed cause, I pray you conceyue, both for varietie, and the vertue of the matter, that my iudgement is carried by circumstances, to treate at large those things, that shortnesse of speeche will not suffer, and that my cunning can not aptly place euery thing in his order: but yet as I <pb xml:id="ep000348-004-a"/>may (vnder your correction) I will boldly hold on my matter which I haue penned, for those people that dwell farre off the Court, that they may see with what maiestie a Prince raigneth, and with what obedience and loue good Subiectes do receiue hir: not that I thinke, but al the Sheeres of England are most willing to do their duties to the vttermost of their powers: but that in deede the like of this entertaynement hath not bin seene: I haue presumed to sette out these things, and namely, bycause at Norwich I was employed to sette forth some shewes, which heere I haue imprinted, as well those that hir Highnesse sawe not, by meanes of euill weather, as those she sawe and heard, and gaue gratious thankes for. And as I mind to wrighte what truely happeneth in my memorie, so meane I to touche a little, the manner and inclination of the common people, whose ciuill sorte and curtesie is greatly to be commended. Withall, I haue <pb xml:id="ep000348-004-b"/>placed at the end of this discourse, a feawe verses, in the honoring of good mindes, and trauelling bodyes, meaning thereby Sir Humfrey Gilbert, Maister Henry Knolles, and others, right worthy and honest Gentlemen, presently passed towards a happy voyage as I hope. These paynes and purposes of myne, proceede onely on the good will I beare to al vertuous actions, and so I trust you will take them, and giuing my small Booke a little countenance (if it so stande with youre pleasure) I shall find my selfe greatly bound vnto you therefore, and among the rest that speaketh well (which are not a few) of your vprighte gouernemente of life, I will not bee the last shall yeeld you deserued laude, as knoweth God, who encrease his grace and good giftes in you, and make your end as honorable, as your dayes haue bin blessed. </p>

        <head>To the Reader. </head>
        <p>IF I shoulde not good Reader as well shewe thee some matter of delight, as publishe to the world these penned discourses, thy wits would waxe a weery of my friuolous wordes, and I should gaine but little frute by my labour and trauell: and greater delight can not be presented, than heere to shew thee the good disposition of some people, bredde vp, and nourished out of the bowels of thine owne nation. And albeit it seemeth strange, that people nurtured farre from Courte, shoulde vse muche courtesie, yet will I prooue by the humblenesse of the common people, where lately the Prince hath passed, that if in a manner all ciuilitie were vtterly decayed, it might haue bin found freshly florishing in many of those parties and places specifyed before: for so soone as the presence of the Prince was entred in their boundes, by a meere motion of homage and fealty, a generall consent of duetie and obedience was seene thorough the whole Countrey, and well were they that might first find occasion by any meanes to welcome a Courtier, <pb xml:id="ep000348-006-a"/>and not with feyned ceremonies, but with friendlye entertaynemente. And although it be a custome, and most laudable manner for the poore commons to runne in flockes to see their Soueraigne, yet there, as me thought, their desire was so greate, that they hadde neuer ynough of the sight so long wished and desired: and such reuerence and humilitie they vsed towardes all the trayne, wheresoeuer they encountred anye of them, that the inwarde affections of the people was playnely expressed by their outward apparance, and manifest curtesies: in so much, that the meanest persons that followed the Court, stood maruellously contented with that they saw, and wondered at the rare &amp; good maner of the people, especially in Norwich, where the entertainemente was so greate, that all degrees, from the highest to the lowest, were had in such admiration, that it seemed another worlde to beholde: which newe kinde of reuerence, and comely custome of the Countrey (as it may be properly applyed) makes the old haughtinesse, and stiffe-necked behauiour of some places, to blushe, and become odious, yea in soyles, that the Prince generally keepeth hir residence, &amp; most abode in, where proude people will passe by many of the Nobilitie, withoute mouing eyther cappe or knee, a stubborne stoutenesse, and an vnmannerly <pb xml:id="ep000348-006-b"/>disordered boldnesse, bredde vp and fostered on the long familiaritie had with the noble mens seruants, and dayly view of their maisters, with whiche sighte they are so cloyed and weeryed, that theyr duetie is forgotten, and vtterly reiected, that ought to be ashamed of abuse, and shoulde vse more reuerente manners. If they would (to leaue off thys audacious fashion) but looke on dyuers Sheeres in this lande, as Lancasheere, Chesheere, Shropsheere, and other Sheeres farre from the Court, they might soone bee learned to clappe on more comelynesse, and vse lesse obstinacie. And if they thynke scorne to bee taughte at home of oure owne people, it were good they were Shipped into Fraunce or Flaunders, oure neere neyboures, where the meaner sorte are not onely knowen by theyr garmentes and goyng, but perceyued by theyr gestures, and humblenesse of countenaunce and speeche. Nowe gentle Reader, thynke no other of thys my discourse in the commendation of courtesie, but that I reioyce to see suche auntiente humilitie as yet helde vp and mainteyned in Englande, when pride and vayneglory woulde ouerthrowe the good dispositions of the people, and breede both to GOD and Man a common contempte. And, as I haue rehearsed a peece of those <pb xml:id="ep000348-007-a"/>thinges I sawe in Suffolke and Norffolke, to further thy delight towards the reading of my simple Booke, so looke for presentlye at my handes the rest of that Progresse whiche I am truely instructed of, or may come to my memorie. Thus committing to thy handes and head the boldnesse of my enterprise, and view of those Verses and matter I heere haue sette out. I bid thee farewell. </p>

        <head>Â¶ The entertaynemente of the Queenes Maiestie into Suffolke, and Norffolke. </head>
        <p>TO wright of the receiuing of hir highnesse into Suffolke and Norffolke in euery poynte, as matter may moue me, woulde conteyne a great time, in making a iust rehearsall thereof: wherefore I will but briefely recite it, and committe the circumstance and manner of the same, to your discretion and iudgement. The troth is, albeit they hadde but small warning certaynely to build vpon, of the comming of the QuÃ©enes Maiestie into both those ShÃ©eres, the Gentlemen had made suche ready prouision, that all the veluets and silkes were taken vp that might be layde hand on, and bought for any money, and soone conuerted to such garments and sutes of roabes, that the shew thereof might haue beautifyed the greatest triumph that was in Englande these many yeares: for (as I hearde) there were two hundred yong Gentlemen, cladde all in white veluet, and thrÃ©e hundred of the grauer sorte apparelled in blacke veluet coates, and faire chaynes, all ready at one instant and place, with fiftÃ©ene hundred seruing men more on Horsebacke, well and brauely mounted in good order, ready to receyue the QuÃ©enes highnesse into Suffolke, which surely was a comely troupe, and a noble sight to beholde: and all these waited on the Sheriffe Sir William Spring, during the QuÃ©enes Maiesties abode in those parties, and to the very confynes of Suffolke. But before hir highnesse passed to Norffolke, there was <pb xml:id="ep000348-008-a"/>in Suffolke such sumptuous feasting and bankets, as seldome in any part of the world hath bin sÃ©ene before. The maister of the rolles, Sir William Cordall, was one of the firste that beganne this great feasting, and did lighte suche a Candle to the rest of the ShÃ©ere, that many were glad bountifully and franckly to follow the same example, with such charges and cost, as the whole trayne were in some sort pleased therewith. And nÃ©ere Bury, Sir William Drury for his part at his house, made the Queenes highnesse a costly and delicat dinner, and Sir Robert Iermyne of Roeshbroke feasted the French Embassadoures two seuerall times, with whiche charges and courtesie they stood maruellously contented. The Sheriffe Sir William Spring, Sir Thomas Kidson, Sir Arthur Higham, &amp; diuers other of worship, kept great houses, and sundry eyther at the QuÃ©enes comming, or returne, solemnely feasted hir highnesse, yea and deffrayed the whole charges for a day or twayne, presented giftes, made suche triumphes and deuises, as in dÃ©ede was most noble to beholde, and very thankefully accepted. The Norffolke Gentlemen hearing how dutifullie their neybours had receyued the Prince, prepared in lyke sort to shewe themselues dutifull, and so in most gallantest maner, assembled and set forward with fiue and twenty hundred Horsemen, whereof as some affirme, were sixe hundreth Gentlemen, so brauely attired, and mounted, as in dÃ©ede was worthy the noting, which goodly company wayted on theyr Sheriffe a long season: but in good sooth (as I haue heard credibly spoken) the bankets and feastes began hÃ©ere afresh, and all kind of triumphes that might be deuised, were put in practise and proofe. The earle of Surrey did shewe most sumptuous chÃ©ere, in whose Parke were spÃ©eches well sette out, &amp; a speciall Deuice much commended: and the rest, as a number of Gentlemen, whose names I haue not, were no whit behinde to the vttermost of their abilities, in all that mighte be done and deuised. But when the QuÃ©enes highnesse came to Norwich, the substance of the whole Triumph and feasting, was in a manner there new to beginne, for order was taken <pb xml:id="ep000348-008-b"/>there, that euery day, for sixe dayes togither, a Shew of some strange Deuice should be sÃ©ene, and the Maior and Aldermen, appointed among themselues and their brÃ©ethren, that no one person, reteyning to the QuÃ©ene, shoulde be vnfeasted, or vnbidden to dinner and supper, during the space of those sixe dayes: which order was well and wisely obserued, and gayned their Citie more fame and credite, than they wot of: for that courtesie of theirs shall remayne in perpetuall memorie, whiles the walles of their Citie standeth. Besides the money they bestowed on diuers of the trayne, and those that tooke paynes for them (albeit my selfe but slenderly considered) will be a witnesse of theyr well doyng and good will, whiles the report of these things may be called to remembrance. I can not nor ought not, considering theyr great charges (and discrete gouernemente in these causes) but gyue them due laude and reputation, as farre as my penne or reporte may doe them good, and stretche out theyr credite. For most assuredly, they haue taughte and learned all the Townes and Cities in Englande a lesson, howe to behaue themselues in such like seruices and actions. </p>
        <p>Nowe to returne to the Shewes and purposed matter penned out by me (to shorten the season, and moue pastime to the Prince) I thoughte it conueniente to printe them in order, as they were inuented: for I was the fyrste that was called, and came to Norwiche aboute that businesse, and remayned there thrÃ©e long wÃ©ekes before the Courte came thyther, deuising and studying the best I coulde for the Citie, albeit other Gentlemen, as Maister Goldingham, Maister Garter, and others, dyd seeppe in after, and broughte to passe that alreadye is sette in Print in a Booke, where the Orations and spÃ©eches of diuers are set out playnely and truly: and for that my meaning was orderly to procÃ©ede, I haue hÃ©ere playnly drawen out my Deuice, not that I thinke it merits anye greate memorie, nor claymeth credite, but onely that myne honest intente may bÃ©e thereby expressed, and my friendes maye sÃ©e how glad I am to honor God, my Prince, <pb xml:id="ep000348-009-a"/>and my Countrey, trusting to set forth other workes as tyme will permitte, and that right shortly, that shall hold you longer tacke, and better please you.

On this Skaffolde, was placed an excellent Boy, wel and gallantly decked, in a long white roabe of Taffata, a Crimson Skarfe wrought with gold, folded on the Turkishe fashion aboute his browes, and a gay Garlande of fine floures on his head, which Boy was not sÃ©ene, till the QuÃ©ene had a good season marked the Musicke, whiche was maruellous swÃ©ete and good, albeit the rudenesse of some ringer of belles did somewhat hinder the noyse and harmonie: and as soone as the Musike ended, the Boy stepped reuerently before the QuÃ©ene, and spake these words that followe. </p>

And so vpon Monday before supper, I made a Deuice, as though MERCVRIE had bin sente from the Gods, to request the QuÃ©ene to come abroade, and behold what: was deuised for hir welcome, the whole matter whereof doth follow. </p>

          <p>THe Coatch that MERCVRIE came into the QuÃ©ene, was closely kept in secret a long season, and when the time came it must passe towards the Court, it had a Trumpetter with it, and the Coatchman was made to driue so fast, as the Horses should sÃ©eme to flye, which was so well obserued, as the people wondered at the swiftnesse thereof, and followed it in suche flockes and multitudes, that scarce in a great grÃ©ene (where the Preaching place is) mighte be founde roome for any more people. And when the Coatch approched in the hearing of a Trumpet, the Trumpetter sounded, and so came in to the grÃ©ene sounding, vntill the Coatche was full placed before a window at the whyche the QuÃ©ene stoode, and mighte be playnely sÃ©ene, and openly viewed. When MERCVRIE hadde espyed hir highnesse, he skipped out of the Coatche, and being on the grounde, gaue a iump or two, and aduanced himselfe in suche a sorte, that the Queene smiled at the boldnesse of the Boy. Thus MERCVRIE beholding the QuÃ©ene with great courage and audacitie, at the length bowed downe his head, and immediately stoode bolt vpright, and shaked his rodde, and so beganne his spÃ©eche with a most assured countenance, and brauely pronounced it in dÃ©ede. </p>

          <p>MERCVRIE hauing thus spoken to the QuÃ©en (whose gratious inclination is suche, as will not haue anye thing duetifully offred to passe vnregarded) was well heard, hir Highnesse standing at a windowe, and (as I knowe,) the SpÃ©ech very well taken and vnderstoode. MERCVRIE as he came, passed away, at whose Coatch the people (that had seldome sÃ©ene such a Deuice) maruelled, and gazed very much: for it had horsses to drawe it finely paynted as winged, to as great shewe and order of that it presented, as witte mighte imagine: the Coatchman sutable to the same: and a Trumpeter in righte good garmentes, as decente for that purpose as coulde be deuised. But the Coatche was made and framed on such a fashion, as few men haue sÃ©ene: the whole wherof was couered with Birdes, and naked Sprites hanging by the hÃ©eles in the aire and cloudes, cunningly painted out, as thoughe by some thunder cracke they had bene shaken &amp; tormented, yet stayed by power deuine in their places, to make the more wonder and miraculous Shew. And on the middle of that Coatch stoode a high compassed Tower, bedeckt with golden and gay iewels, in the top whereof was placed a faire plume of whyte feathers, all to be spangde and trimmed to the most brauerie: MERCVRIE himself in blew Satin lined with cloth of gold, his garmentes cutte and slasshed on the finest manner, a peaked hatte of the same coloure, as though it should cutte and seuer the winde asunder, and on the same a payre of wings, and wings on his hÃ©eles lykewise. And on his golden rodde were little wings also, aboute the whiche rodde, were two wriggling or scrawling Serpentes, whiche sÃ©emed to haue life when the rodde was moued or shaken. So in this sorte and forme was MERCVRIE and his Coatch set forthe, and in dÃ©ede at such a season, as a great number looked not for any shew, nor things were ready, as some thoughte, to performe that was necessary and expected. Yet happe was so good, and the gracious fauour of the Prince, that all was well taken, and construed to the best meaning of the Deuisor. So ended that dayes Deuice, which offered occasion to further matter. </p>

          <head>Tuesdayes Deuice. </head>
          <p>AT this season, although I was not well prouided of thinges necessary for a Shewe (by meane of some crossing causes in the Citie) yet hearing the QuÃ©ene roade abroade, determined as I mighte (and yet by helpe of friendes and happe) very well to venter the hazzard of a Shewe, and to be full in the way where hir highnesse should passe towards hir dinner, in whiche determination many doubts were to be cast, and many men persuaded to tarrie a better time, but considering how time rolled on, and dayes and houres did wast (without doyng any thing promised, and not perfourmed) I hastily prepared my Boyes and Men, with al their furnitures, and so sette forward with two Coatches, hansomely trimmed. The common people beholding the manner thereof, and grÃ©edie to gaze on that shoulde bÃ©e done, followed, as their fansies did leade them: so that when we came into the open field, there was as great a trayne and preace about the Shewe, as came with the Courte at that instant, which graced much the matter, and gaue it some expected hope of good successe: and for that you shall (and please you) imagine you sÃ©e the thing, I haue hÃ©ere set downe the whole manner of the Shew, and after that euery part as they were played, shall be hÃ©ere expressed. </p>
          <p>First, there is a fayned deuice, that VENVS and CVPID were thrust out of Heauen, and walking on the earth, mette a Philosopher, who demaunded from whence they came, they told the Philosopher what they were, and he replyed, and beganne with troth and tauntes to tickle them so nÃ©ere, that VENVS fell in a great anger, and CVPID ranne away, and lefte his mother and the Philosopher disputing togither, but CVPID bycause he would be nourished some where, ranne to the Courte, and there soughte for succoure, and encountring the Queene, beganne to complayne hys state and his mothers, and tolde howe the Philosopher had handled them both: but <pb xml:id="ep000348-013-b"/>finding neyther aunswere nor ayde, returned agayne, but not to his mother, for she was fallen madde (vpon a conceyt that she was not made of) and CVPID wandering in the worlde, met with Dame Chastitie and hir maydes, called Modestie, Temperance, Good exercise, and Shamefastnesse, and she with hir foure maydes encountring CVPID in a goodly Coatche, and without any honest gard waiting on him, sette vpon him, threwe him out of his golden seate, trode on hys pompe, spoyled him of his counterfeyte Godhead and cloke, and tooke away his bowe and his quiuer of arrowes, (the one headed with leade, and the other with golde) and so sent him like a fugitiue away, and mounted vp into the Coatche hir selfe and hir maydes, and so came to the QuÃ©ene, and rehearsed what had happened (although this was done in hir view) and bycause (sayd Chastitie) that the QuÃ©ene had chosen the best life, she gaue the QuÃ©ene CVPIDS bow, to learn to shoote at whome she pleased, since none coulde wounde hir highnesse hart, it was mÃ©ete (said Chastitie) that she should do with CVPIDS bow and arrowes what she pleased: and so did Chastitie depart as she said to the powers deuine. CVPID in the meane while wandering in the world, had found out Wantonnesse and Ryot, who soone fell in beggerie &amp; ruyne (a spectacle to be looked into) and felt such dayly miserie with Wantonnesse &amp; Ryot, that CVPID was forced to fling away once agayne, and hazarde himselfe to fall into the handes of naughty people, or where Fortune assigned, and comming abroade, happened vpon the Philosopher, who talked with him agayne, and told hym his erroures, and other poyntes of pryde and presumption, declaring it was a greate blaspheme and abuse, to reporte and belÃ©eue that in Heauen were any other Gods but one, and he had the only rule of all, that made all of naughte. In whyche reasoning and discourses, CVPID waxt warme, and yet in his greatest heate knewe not howe nor where to coole himselfe, at whiche time came Wantonnesse and Ryot, and persuaded CVPID to play no longer the foole (in striuing with Philosophers) and goe away with them, so CVPID <pb xml:id="ep000348-014-a"/>departed, and wente away with Wantonnesse and Riotte, and the Philosopher remayned, and declared that all abuses and follyes shoulde come to no better end, than presently was expressed by the miserie of Wantonnesse, Riotte, and CVPID. Then Modestie and hir fellowes, leauing their Mistresse Dame Chastity, with the powers Deuine, came soft and faire in their Mistresse Coatch, singing a Song of chast life, &amp; when the Song was ended, Modestie sent, as she said she was, from hir Mistresse, spake to the QuÃ©ene a good season, and so the matter ended, for the whiche Shew, I had gracious words of the QuÃ©ene openly and often pronounced by hir Highnesse. Nowe before you reade the partes, you must throughly note what my discourse thereof hathe bin, and carrying that care and good will with you, the matter shall sÃ©eme to haue the better life, and I shall thinke my labour &amp; studie well bestowed. </p>

          <p>THE Wensday hir highnesse dyned at my Lord of Surreys, where were the Frenche Embassadours also, and a moste rare and delicate Dinner and Banquette. At whiche season I dyd watch with a Shewe (called MANHODE and DEZARTE,) at my Lorde of Surreys backe dore, going to the QuÃ©enes Barge: but the rowme was so little, that neyther the Shotte, the Armed men, nor the Players, could haue place conueniente: Wherevpon we toke Boats, and conueyed our people downe the water, towards a landing place that we hoped the QuÃ©ene woulde come vnto. And there hauing all things in a readinesse, hoouered on the water thrÃ©e long houres, by which meane the nighte came on, and so we were faine to withdrawe oure selues and goe homewarde, trusting for a better time and occasion, which in dÃ©ede was offred the nexte day after by the QuÃ©enes Maiesties owne good motion, who tolde me she woulde sÃ©e what pastimes were prepared, as hereafter you shall perceyue by the discourse of these matters that I meane to make, and by this Shewe of MANHODE, and the Shewe of the NYMPHES, which I minde fully and truely to treate of. </p>

          <head>Thurseday. </head>
          <p>THe Thurseday in the morning, my Lorde Chamberlaine gaue me warning the QuÃ©enes highnesse woulde ride abroade in the after noone, and he commaunded me to be ready, dutifully to presente hir with some Shewe. Then knowing whiche way the QuÃ©ene woulde ride (by coniecture and instructions giuen) I caused a place to be made and digged for the Nymphes of the water, the manner and proportion whereof, was in this forme and fashion. Firste, there was measure taken for thrÃ©escore foote of grounde euery way, the hole to be made dÃ©epe and foure square, whiche ground was couered with a Canuas paynted grÃ©ene like the grasse, and at euery side on the Canuas, ranne a string through Curtayne rings, whiche string might easily be drawen any kinde of way, by reason of two great poales that lay along in the grounde, and aunswered the Curtayne or Canuas on eache side so, that drawing a small corde in the middle of the Canuas, the earth woulde seeme to open, and so shut againe, as the other end of the cord was drawen backward. And in the same caue was a noble noyse of Musicke of al kind of instruments, seuerally to be sounded and played vpon, and at one time they shoulde be sounded all togither, that mighte serue for a consorte of broken Musicke. And in the same caue likewise was placed twelue water Nimphes, desguised or dressed most strangely, eache of them had eyther vpon white Silke, or fine linnen, grÃ©ene segges, stitched cunningly on a long garment, so well wrought, and set on, as scarce any whit might be perceiued. And euery Nimph had in hir hand a great bundell of bulrushes, and had on hir head a Garland of Iuievnder the whiche Iuie was a Coyfe of Mosse, and vnder the Mosse was there long goodly heare like golden tresses that couered hir shoulders, and in a manner, raughte downe vnto hir middle. And touching the beautie of the Nimphes, they seemed to be the chosen children of a world, and became theyr <pb xml:id="ep000348-019-b"/>attire so wel, that their beauty might haue abused a right good iudgement, for diuers of those that knew them before, (albeit they were bare faced) coulde scarce knowe them in their garments, and sundry tooke them to be yong girles and wenches, prepared for the nonce, to procure a laughter. These Nimphs thus apparelled, and all things in very good plight and readynesse, there was deuised, that at the QuÃ©enes comming nÃ©ere the water side (as this caue stoode at the brimme of the Riuer) one Nimph shoulde poppe vp out of the caue first, and salute the QuÃ©ene with a spÃ©ech, and then another, and so till four of them had finished their spÃ©eches, there they shoulde remayne, and when they retired into their caue, the Musicke should beginne, which sure had bin a noble hearing, and the more melodious, for the varietie thereof, and bycause it should come secretely and strangely out of the earth. And when the Musicke was done, then should all the twelue Nymphes haue issued togither, and daunced a daunce with Timbrels that were trimmed with belles, and other iangling things, which Timbrels were as brode as a SÃ©eue, hauing bottoms of fine parchment, and being sounded, made suche a confused noyse, and pastime, that it was to be wondered at, besides the strangenesse of the Timbrels (yet knowen to oure forefathers) was a matter of admiration to such as were ignorante of that new founde toy, gathered and borowed from our elders. So in order and readinesse stoode that Shew for the time. And to kÃ©ep that Shewe company (but yet far off) stood the Shew of Manhode &amp; Dezart, as first to be presented, and that Shew was as well furnished as the other, Men all, sauing one Boy, called Beautie, for the which Manhode, Fauour, and Dezarte, did striue (or shoulde haue contended) but good Fortune (as victor of all conquestes) was to come in, and ouerthrowe Manhode, Fauour, Dezarte, and all their powers, and onely by fine force (vppon a watch-word spoken) should lay hande on Beautie, and carrie or leade hir away. The other suters troubled with this kinde of dealing, should talke togither, and sweare to be in one minde, for an open reuenge, &amp; vpon that Fortune should crye arme, arme. <pb xml:id="ep000348-020-a"/>The other side called for their friendes, at which styrre should appeare both their strengthes: but good Fortune should faire in power excÃ©ede his enimies: And yet to shew that Destenie, (and who best can conquer) shal gouerne all, Fortune should make an offer, that sir to six with sworde and targette shoulde ende the brawle and businesse: then sixe Gentlamen on either side with rebated swords and targets (only in dublet and hose, and Morion on head) approched, and woulde clayme the combat, and deale togither twelue blowes a peece, and in the ende Fortune should be victor: and then the Shot, and Armed men shoulde fall at variaunce so sharpely (vppon mystaking of the matter) that Fortunes side should triumph and march ouer the bellies of their enimies: in which time was legges and armes of men (well and liuely wrought) to be let fall in numbers on the grounde, as bloudy as mighte be. Fortune regarding nothing but victorie, marcheth so away in greate triumph, and then shoulde haue come into the place a dolefull song for the death of Manhood, Fauour, and Dezartes, and so the Shewe should haue ended. But now note what befell after this great businesse and preparation, for as the QuÃ©enes highnesse was appoynted to come to hir Coatch, and the Lords and Courtiers were readie to mount on Horsebacke, there fell suche a shoure of rayne (and in the necke thereof came such a terrible thunder) that euery one of vs were driuen to seeke for couerte and most comfort, in so muche, that although some of vs in Boate stoode vnder a Bridge, we were all so dashed and washed, that it was a greater pastime to sÃ©e vs looke like drowned Rattes, than to haue beheld the vttermost of the Shewes rehearsed. Thus you sÃ©e, a Shew in the open fielde is alwayes subiect to the suddayne change of weather, and a number of more incoueniences than I express. But what shoulde I say of that whiche the Citie lost by this cause, Ueluets, Silkes, Tinsels, and some cloth of golde, being cutte out for these purposes, and could not serue to any great effect after. Well, there was no more to say, but an old Adage, that Man doth purpose, and God dothe dispose, to whose disposition and pleasure I <pb xml:id="ep000348-020-b"/>committe the guide of greater matters. So this Thursdaye tooke his leaue from vs, and left vs looking one vpon another, and he that thought he had receyued moste iniurie, kept greatest silence, and lapping vp, among a bundle of other mysfortunes this euil chaunce, euery person quietly passed to his lodging. The nexte day was the QuÃ©ene to departe the towne, and I fearing that all my labour shoulde be loste, deuised to conuert the Nimphes of the water, to the Fairies on the land, as hereafter shall appeare: In the meanewhile I haue sette downe the foure spÃ©eches that foure Nimphes shoulde haue spoken at the Waterside, where the QuÃ©ene was looked for: And withal, I haue written the order and parts of the Shew of MANHODE and DEZARTES, that no one thing that was well meante, should slÃ©epe in silence. And first and formost you must conceiue, that the Shew of MANHODE was inuented to be playde in a Garden, or wheresoeuer had bene found a conueniente place, the Prince then being in presence. And vnto hir Highnesse shoulde there haue come a Lady called Beautie, humbly on knÃ©es, requiring ayde and succoure, or else iudgemente, in a matter disputable, and in greate controuersie, vpon whose sute and humble intercession, the disputation was to beginne in order as followeth, in manner of a Dialoge, the parts whereof are hÃ©ere for you to reade at your leysure, and after the same, as the Shewe of the Nymphes shoulde haue bin, shall their parts followe in lyke sort. </p>

          <head>Fridayes Deuice. </head>
          <p>ON the Friday, the Court vpon remoue, the Citie troubled with many causes, and some sÃ©eking to do seruice like my selfe, moued me to doe somewhat of my selfe, bycause myne aydes (as many tunes they were before) were drawne from me, each one about his owne businesse, and I lefte to mine owne inuentions and policie, at whiche erigente, or casuall things of Fortune, I drewe my Boyes vnto me, that were the Nymphes on the water, and so departed the Citie, with such garments and stuffe necessarie as fitted my purpose and the matter I went about. Then chose I a ground, by the which the QuÃ©ene must passe, enclosing my company in the corner of a field, being defenced with high and thicke bushes, and there some parts I made, whych the Boyes mighte misse, bycause the time was short for the learning of those parts. But I being resolued to do some what might make the QuÃ©ene laugh, appointed that seauen Boyes of twelue, should passe through a hedge from the place of oure abode (which was gallantly trimmed) and deliuer seauen spÃ©eches, whiche followe in the next leafe. And these Boyes (you must vnderstand) were dressed like Nimphes of the water, and were to play by a deuice and degrÃ©es the Phayries, and to daunce (as nÃ©ere as could be ymagined) like the Phayries. Their attire, and comming so strangely out, I know made the QuÃ©enes highnesse smyle and laugh withall. And I hearing this good hope, being apparelled like a water Sprite, beganne to sounde a Timbrell, and the rest with me, all the twelue Nymphes togither (when the seauen had repayred in) sounded Timbrels likewise. And although I had no greate harting, yet as I durst, I ledde the yong foolishe Phayries a daunce, which boldnesse of mine bredde no disgrace, and as I heard said, was well taken. The QuÃ©ene vpon our retiring in, <pb xml:id="ep000348-026-b"/>hasted to hir Highnesse lodging, whiche was seauen Myles off, and at that present, when the Shewe ended, it was past fiue of the clocke. </p>
          <p>Thus haue you truly hearde the reporte of mine owne workes and inuentions, with the which did no any one deale but my selfe. And as I haue made a recitall of matters done in Norwich, so meane I a little to treate of the QuÃ©enes returne from thence, in as short and briefe order as I may, and the briefer, bycause I haue not all the Gentlemens names, in whose houses the QuÃ©ene lay, and who bestowed some entertaynemente on the trayne, but those, in whose houses I was (and where I saw or heard any thing worthy memorie) I mind to speake of, and touch, praying you that shall reade the same, to pardon me, where I omitte any matter or men that merits commendation, for it is not wante of good will that shall make me forget any good entertaynementes bestowed on the Courte, but it is wante of knowledge that shall cause me so sleightly runne ouer the causes, and make a briefe report thereof, as knoweth God, who graunt and sende oure QuÃ©ene often to suche pleasant Progresses, and increase good people and louing subiects to shew the like dutie and order, as hathe bene orderly sÃ©ene in thys season, and tyme of triumph. </p>

        <head>Hir Highnesse returne from Norwich. </head>
        <p>NOwe to come to the returne of the QuÃ©enes Maiestie from Norwich, I thinke it as necessarie to be tolde, as the rest of matter penned before, not chiefely for the chÃ©ere and entertaynemente founde returning, but for other causes mÃ©ete to be rehearsed. But to be tedious in that behalfe, and dwell longer on the discourses of the entertaynement than is requisite, I should but wÃ©erie you with the reading therof. So to auoyde the doubts of misliking, and daunger of thys fyne world, and sifting senses, I will playnely fall to the troth of thinges that I meane to haue vnderstood. And so as I haue hÃ©eretofore sayd, the QuÃ©ene passing from Norwich, came to Maister Woodhouses that night, where she was well receyued, and nobly entertayned. From thence to Wodde rising, the chÃ©ere and entertaymente there I sawe not, wherefore I giue it no greate commendation. From thence to Thetforde at Sir Edward Cleeres. The trayne haue tolde me (that was there) how they were worthily feasted. From thence to Sir Thomas Kidsons, where in very dÃ©ede, the fare and banquets did so excÃ©ede a number of other places, that it is worthy the mention. A Shew representing the Phayries (as well as might be) was there sÃ©ene, in the whiche Shew, a rich Iewell was presented to the QuÃ©enes Highnesse. From thence to Maister Reeuets, where all things were well, and in very good order, and meate liberally spent. </p>
        <p>But nowe to speake a little by the way of Gods mightie hande and power, that framed mens harts so well in manye partes, before the QuÃ©enes Highnesse came to Cambridge ShÃ©ere, and to tell how blessedly our great and good God did deale with our dÃ©ere Soueraigne Lady, in causing euery person to shew their dutie, is a matter of great discourse, and of no little weight and comfort to all good minds that shall confesse <pb xml:id="ep000348-028-b"/>of the same, suche a Lorde is oure greate God, that can frame all things to the best, and suche a Soueraigne Ladye we haue, that can make the crooked pathes streighte where she commeth, and drawe the hearts of the people after hyr wheresoeuer she trauels. I had almost passed the boundes of my discourse, by a desire of doing wel, but remembring where I lefte, I beginne agayne, and followe my first intention, to shew the returne of the QuÃ©ene from Norffolke and Suffolke. So from Mayster Reuets, hir Highnesse came to my Lorde Northes, who was no whit behind any of the best for a franke house, a noble heart, and well ordered entertaynement, and there was an Oration made by a Gentleman of Cambridge, and a stately and fayre cuppe presented from the Uniuersitie, all the Embassadors of France beholding the same, and the Gentlemen of the Shire (as in many other places) did beare the Queenes meate to the table, whiche was a great liking, and gladnÃ¨sse to the Gentlemen, and a solemne sighte for Strangers and Subiectes to looke vppon. From my Lorde Northes, to Sir Gyles Allingtons, and there thinges were well, and well liked. From thence, to Sir Iohn Cuttes, but what chÃ©ere there was founde, I knowe not, for I was not there. From thence to Mayster Kapels, where was excellente good chÃ©ere, and entertaynement. From thence to Hide Hall, where I hearde of no greate chÃ©ere nor banketting. From thence to Rockwood Hall, but howe the trayne was there entertayned, I am ignorant of. From thence to Mayster Stonars, and from thence to my L. of Leycesters house, where the Progras ended, and to knit vp all, the good there was reuiued, not only with making a great feast to the QuÃ©ene, &amp; the French Embassador, but also in feasting solemnely (at seueral times) the whole Gard, on Sunday &amp; Munday before the QuÃ©ene came, at his owne table, vsing such courtesse vnto them for the space of two dayes, as was &amp; is worthy of perpetuall memorie. Thus bold I haue bin a little, to speake of the QuÃ©enes Highnesse returne, who God hath so well preserued, that she like a worthy Prince to our great comfort, prospers in peace, to the great disgrace of the enimies of God, and aduersaries of our common Weale and Countrey. </p>

        <l>But only to the Lord aboue, </l>
        <l>and iourney they are in. </l>
        <l>And all for Countreys cause, </l>
        <l>and to enrich the same, </l>
        <l>Now do they hazard all they haue: </l>
        <l>and so for wealth and fame, </l>
        <l>They fare along the Seas, </l>
        <l>they sayle and tide it out, </l>
        <l>They hale and stretch the sheates aloft, </l>
        <l>they toyle and dread no doubt. </l>
        <l>They feede on Bisket hard, </l>
        <l>and drincke but simple beere, </l>
        <l>Salt beefe, and Stockfish drie as kecke, </l>
        <l>is now their greatest cheere. </l>
        <l>And still a fulsome smell </l>
        <l>of pitch and tarre they feele, </l>
        <l>And when Seasicke (God wot) they are, </l>
        <l>about the Shippe they reele. </l>
        <l>And stomacke belcheth vp, </l>
        <l>a dish that Hadocks seeke, </l>
        <l>A bitter messe of sundry meates, </l>
        <l>a Sirrope greene as leeke. </l>

        <l>Yet face will sweat, a heauie fight, </l>

        <l>a greater brunt than this, </l>
        <l>And hope that after hellish paynes, </l>

        <l>In this thy prayse (and other Bookes) </l>
        <l>I speake but right of thee. </l>
        <l>A Boke I made, at thy Farewell, </l>
        <l>in prose (where ere it is) </l>
        <l>Another for thy Welcome home, </l>
        <l>thou shalte haue after this, </l>
        <l>If this mislike thee any whitte. </l>
        <l>So here mine owne good friend </l>
        <l>I bid thee welcome once againe, </l>
        <l>and therewith make an ende. </l>
        <p>THus haue I playnely expressed with pen, what portion of good will I beare to all those that valiantly and worthily are workers to the enriching &amp; honour of our common wealth: And surely I thinke, I am as well bounde to wryte in the praise of those that accompanied Mayster Frobusher this voyage, as all together gyue one alone the commendations of a generall labour and manly enterprise: But I wante their names, that gladly I wishe great fame vnto, and willingly I would put in a Register of good reporte, which in time to come may be touched, not in the respect only of the paynes they haue taken, which merites much, but to the encouragyng of others to the like aduenture, I woulde bestowe some Verses on this rare bande, where in is a knot of right honest Gentlemen, and a crewe of good companions, whose for wardnesse may not be forgotten, and whose faithfull seruice claymes a great consideration and a good regarde. For, although that commonly a <pb xml:id="ep000348-045-a"/>Captayne carries away the credite of battayles and victories where the Souldiers haue done their dueties, &amp; haue bene an occasion of triumph and conquest: yet by the iudgement of a sounde sense and vncorrupted witte, the branches of the ãâã that bring forth leaues, blossoms and fruite, oughte as much to be spoken of, as the bare bodye of the same, whiche without branches, (though it haue neuer so greate sappe) is but barrayne or little estÃ©emed. I remember of late dayes a victory wonne agaynst the Turkes on the Sea, and one man went away with the glory of the same, whiche bredde such disdayne among the rest in whome the force dydlie, that from that time in this present houre, the greate man that wente away with this glory was neuer called or desired to take the same charge in hande agayne. Neuerthelesse some one Generall and Captayne, is more happier and more necessarie than a number of the Merrenary people: For I reade, that a great conquerour after he had receyued his deaths wounde, with causing himselfe to be carried aboute the fielde in a chayre, gaue suche a terrour and feare to the enimies, that they ranne away, and had not the courage to defende their liues and liberties, the dignity, and name, and presence of the person before rehearsed, had so daunted them and taken away the vse of their sprytes. And many matters and noble Histories make mention, that one mans happe, courage and conduite, is farre better (at some instant and season) than the inconstant opinions of a multitude. But yet for al that, it is good to haue wise and stoute Soldiours, whose obedience and manhoode deserues as much commendation, as their Captaines can wish to themselues. When in another worke this may come in question, I will more largely deale therwith among the discourses of warre. And so for this presents I trouble you no further. </p>
