          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Acknowledge, that I am no less unworthy to appear before you, than I was before your Elder Brother, having in me the same duty and reverence for your high Bloud, and the same equal regard for your Person: Yet I come with confidence to you; for having found so affable and sweet a Reception from your dear Brother, I ought not at all to doubt of yours: since his Great Bloud runs in your veins, you must also retain his Vertues; and in you they are justly called so, yet they are not so in all men; for if slaves, and servants, and meaner men, prove affable and humble, it is not Vertue in them, because it is their duty: but in you, being adorned with all your Greatness, it shews so rich a Goodness in you, that all men are oblig'd to return you honour for it, which I do with my heart, and all my faculties. I also present you, Sir, <pb xml:id="ep000609-003-a"/>with a poor French-man, Monsieur Raggou, being party perpale Trooper, and Cook: I tender him to you in his own Equipage just as he landed, with not so much as a shirt to his back: But that is no new thing to the English Nation; therefore, Sir, receive him as an object to exercise your Charity upon; being naked cloath him; let him but wear your Livery, and he will not only be received, but be made welcome to all men: Lay your protecting hand upon him, and he is safe from the malice of his Enemies: And, Sir, as I am bound, so I pray, that you may want no one Vertue that may make you up a Miracle: May your Great Bloud appoint you to cut your own fortune out, and may you do it with such success and valour, that all men of courage may honour you, and the rest of the World fear you. </p>

        <head>THE EPISTLE To the READER. </head>
        <p>EPistles ('tis true) are customary, but I think as unnecessary as Funeral Sermons, for they must either insinuate and flatter grosly, or else say nothing to the purpose: For my part I cannot imagine, Reader, what to say to thee, unless like a raw Preacher I swerve from my Text; and instead of a modest Apology for my bold printings, tell thee a Tale of Maestricht being taken, or the Dutch bang'd at Sea; and to do that were to rob the Gazette, and so be call'd in question for Intrenchments. What then shall I say? shall I praise my Play to thee? No, that were to be a vain glorious Ass; and in thy power, Reader, to prove me so: What then, shall I decry it? No, that were to break the Stationer, that perhaps has paid too dear for it: What then, shall I discover the Plot and Intrigue of the Play to thee? No, to speak of the Plot in the Epistle, were to fore-stall <pb xml:id="ep000609-004-a"/>the reading of the Play, and so dam the sail of it. Instead then of an ingenious Epistle to divert, I beg a crafty Boon, Reader, that some one eminent leading Voice amongst you, will be for once so kind, as to give an excellent Character to the World of this my Play; and by that decoy people may be drawn in to buy it off: so that, as I have cozen'd the Stationer, by this means the Stationer may over-reach you; and in so doing, Reader, you will </p>

        <l>What made you Wits so spightfully to come? </l>

        <l>You have e'en brib'd the Door-keepers I doubt, </l>

        <l>You must, nor censure Poet, nor his Play, </l>

        <l>Deal you, Sirs, with your Match, your Dryden wit, </l>

        <l>It is some conquest for to censure him▪ </l>
        <l>That's fill'd with Wit, and Iudgement to the brim▪ </l>
        <l>He is for your censure, and I'm for theirs, </l>
        <l>Pray therefore meddle with your own affairs. </l>

            <p>We have all arriv'd at excellent nick-names; to say truth, according to our several degrees and ways of Plundering: but you, Cornet, have a name that's proper for all Cornets to be call'd by; for they are all Beardless boys in our Army: for the most part of our Horse were rais'd thus, The honest Country Gentleman raises the Troop at his own charge, then he gets a Low-Country Lieutenant to fight his Troop safely, then sends for his son from School to be his Cornet, and he puts off his Childs coat to put on a Buff-coat; and this is the constitution of our Army: So I salute you, Cornet Beardless.

        <head>EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>PRologues, and Epilogues, should something say </l>
        <l>In order to th' excusing of a Play; </l>
        <l>But things toth' purpose, being laid aside, </l>
        <l>We shoot at random at least six bows wide; </l>
        <l>Speaking of this or that, of Sea or Land, </l>
        <l>Of any Matter but the thing in hand▪ </l>
        <l>If men with such faults, Poets do Commence, </l>
        <l>I may put in with my impertinence. </l>
        <l>And though my dull Muse cannot make y'a feast, </l>
        <l>I'd fain be thought a Poet at the least: </l>
        <l>I find I am one, I can prove it plain, </l>
        <l>Both by my empty Purse, and shallow Brain: </l>
        <l>I've other symptoms to confirm it too, </l>
        <l>I've great, and self conceit, of all I do: </l>
        <l>I have my little Cullies too i'th' Town, </l>
        <l>Both to admire my works, and lend a Crown. </l>
        <l>My Poets day I morgage to some Citt, </l>
        <l>At least six months before my Play is writ; </l>
        <l>And on that day away your Poet runs, </l>
        <l>Knowing full well, in sholes, come all his duns. </l>
        <l>If these things make me not a perfect Poet, </l>
        <l>He that has better Title let him shew it. </l>
