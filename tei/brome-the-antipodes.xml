        <l>Me thought I landed on th' Antipodes; </l>

        <l>My Scull mistooke: thy Book, being in my hand, </l>
        <l>Hurried my Soule to th' Antipodian strand, </l>
        <l>Where I did feast my Fancy, and mine Eyes </l>
        <l>With such variety of Rarities, </l>
        <l>That I perceive thy Muse frequents some shade, </l>
        <l>Might be a Grove for a Pierian Maide. </l>
