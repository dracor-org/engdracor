        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THE very Title to these Ensuing Sheets seems so clearly to express the Author's Design in them that Use alone, rather than any Necessity, seems to extort this from him: For though the Instruction of the meanest <hi>Protestant Christian </hi>in Hungary, was greatly the Author's scope and intent, yet the terrible Impressions left in the Two last Reigns, even upon all Degrees and Qualities, remain yet so fresh and lively, that any one that would take the pains to read Three or Four▪ of the First Pages, would readily believe any Explanatory Preamble; needless 'tis therefore to satisfie the Nicety or Prejudice, that some Persons may conceive, from the Author's too boldly, and too publickly intruding into the Cabinets of Princes, that this small Apology is prefixt: In order to this, the Author Solemnly here Declares, That the Lashing and Exploding the Crimes and Villanies publickly, and most under a seeming Form of Law and Justice, committed in the Two late Reigns, rather then exposing any particular Persons, was his chief Aim and Design; and that since, Works of this Nature, could not be done, without the using some Fictitious Names of Persons, whereon to fix his Characters, He thinks He may justly decline, any Blame ensuing thereupon, since they alone can justy pretend to be affronted, whose Consciences too clearly convince them of the Truth of these Relations: The Truth I say, which by the Authentick Testimony, as well as Experience of many Grave Persons, has often, already, though in another Method, been asserted and exprest: And although in one thing especially, viz. in his representing the King Poysoned, He will not be so Obstinate, as to confess he hath Demonstration for it, yet the common Fame of it remaining amongst us, almost without Contradiction, even to this very Day, may in some measure be excused, as the Foundation of a very plausible Argument, in a Work especially of this kind: Another Observation is too Obvious to him; Why a Person of so unpolite a Stile, and perhaps not truly verst in a regular Connection of Things, would venture upon a Work which ought to have been left to the Elaborate Pens of some more Experienc'd Author. To this he Answers, That being to play the Historian, rather than the Orator, to Instruct with Truth, rather than to Amuse with Flourishes; to vndeceive the Commonalty (so often led aside by the crafty Insinuations of the Witty) and to bring in Parallel the happy State of Hungary, under the present Government; with its deplorable Condition under the Two last Reigns, he thought this stile and manner more suitable to his Designs, and their Advantages; desiring them to read with an Impartial Judgment, the following Sheets; and promising to submit to the acknowledgment of any Errors, such a Judgment shall at any time Convict and Consute him. </p>
