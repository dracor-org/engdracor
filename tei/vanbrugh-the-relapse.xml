        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>TO go about to excuse halfe the Defects this Abortive Brat is come into the World with, wou'd be to provoke the Town with a long useless Preface, when 'tis, I doubt, sufficiently sower'd already, by a tedious Play. </p>
        <p>I do therefore (with all the Humility of a Repenting Sinner) confess, it wants every thing— but length; and in that, I hope the severest Critique, will be pleas'd to acknowledge, I have not been wanting. But my Modesty will sure attone for every thing, when the World shall know it is so great, I am even to this day insensible of those two shining Graces in the Play (which some part of the Town is pleas'd to Compliment me with) Blasphemy and Bawdy. </p>
        <p>For my part, I cannot find 'em out. If there was any obscene Expressions upon the Stage, here they are in the Print; for I have dealt fairly, I have not sunk a Sylable, that cou'd (tho' by racking of Mysteries) be rang'd under that head; and yet I believe with a steady Faith, there is not one Woman of a real Reputation in Town, but when she has read it impartially over in her Closet, will find it so innocent, she'll think it <pb xml:id="ep000780-003-a"/>no affront to her Prayer-Book, to lay it upon the same Shelf. So to them, (with all manner of Deference,) I intirely refer my Cause, and I'm confident they'll justify me, against those pretenders to good Manners, who at the same time, have so little respect for the Ladies, they wou'd extract a Bawdy Jest from an Ejaculation, to put 'em out of countenance. But I expect to have these well-bred Persons always my Enemies, since I'm sure I shall never write any thing lewd enough, to make 'em my Friends. </p>
        <p>As for the Saints (your thorough-pac'd ones I mean) with screw'd Faces and wry Mouths) I despair of them, for they are Friends to no body. They love nothing, but their Altars and Themselves. They have too much Zeal to have any Charity: they make Debauches in Piety, as Sinners do in Wine; and are as quarrelsome in their Religion, as other People are in their Drink: so I hope no body will mind what they say. But if any Man (with flat plod Shooes, a little Band, Greazy Hair, and a dirty Face, who is wiser than I, at the expence of being Forty years older) happens to be offended at a story of a Cock and a Bull, and a Priest and a Bull-Dog: I beg his Pardon with all my heart, which I hope I shall obtain, by eating my words, and making this publick Recantation. I do therefore for his satisfaction, acknowledge, I <pb xml:id="ep000780-003-b"/>Ly'd, when I said, they never quit their hold; for in that little time I have liv'd in the World, I thank God I have seen 'em forc'd to't, more than once; but next time I'll speak with more Caution and Truth; and only say, they have very good Teeth. </p>
        <p>If I have offended any honest Gentlemen of the Town, whose Friendship or good Word is worth the having, I am very sorry for it; I hope they'll correct me as gently as they can, when they consider I have had no other design, in running a very great Risque, than to divert (if possible) some part of their Spleen, in spight of their Wives and their Taxes. </p>
        <p>One word more about the Bawdy, and I have done. I own the first night this thing was acted, some indecencies had like to have happen'd, but 'twas not my fault. </p>
        <p>The fine Gentleman of the Play, drinking his Mistresses Health in Nants Brandy, from six in the Morning, to the time he wadled on upon the Stage in the Evening, had toasted himself up, to such a pitch of Vigor, I confess I once gave Amanda for gone, and I am since (with all due Respect to Mrs Rogers) very sorry she scap't); for I am confident a certain Lady, (let no one take it to her self that's handsome) who highly blames the Play, for the barrenness of the conclusion wou'd then have allow'd it, a very natural Close. </p>

        <head>First Prologue, Spoken by Miss. Cross. </head>
        <l>LAdys, this Play in too much haste was writ, </l>
        <l>To be o'er-charg'd with either Plot or Wit; </l>
        <l>'Twas Got, Conceiv'd, and Born in six Weeks space, </l>
        <l>And Wit, you know, 's as slow in growth— as Grace. </l>
        <l>Sure it can ne'r be ripen'd to your Taste, </l>
        <l>I doubt 'twill prove, our Author bred too fast. </l>
        <l>For mark'em well, who with the Muses Marry, </l>
        <l>They rarely do Conceive, but they Miscarry. </l>
        <l>'Tis the hard Fate of those wh' are big with Rhime, </l>
        <l>Still to be brought to Bed before their time. </l>
        <l>Of our late Poets, Nature few has made, </l>
        <l>The greatest part— are only so by Trade. </l>
        <l>Still want of something, brings the scribling Fit, </l>
        <l>For want of Money, some of 'em have Writ, </l>
        <l>And others do't you see— for want of Wit. </l>
        <l>Honour, they fancy, summons 'em to Write, </l>
        <l>So out they lug in wresty Nature's Spight, </l>
        <l>As some of you spruce Beaux do— when you Fight. </l>
        <l>Yet let the ebb of Wit be ne'r so low, </l>
        <l>Some glimpse of it, a Man may hope to shew, </l>
        <l>Upon a Theme, so ample— as a Beau. </l>
        <l>So, howsoe're true Courage may decay, </l>
        <l>Perhaps there's not one Smock-Face here to day, </l>
        <l>But's bold as Caesar— to attack a Play. </l>
        <l>Nay, what's yet more, with an undaunted Face </l>
        <l>To do the thing with more Heroick Grace, </l>
        <l>'Tis six to Four, y'attack the strongest place. </l>
        <l>You are such Hotspurs, in this kind of venture, </l>
        <l>Where there's no Breach, just there you needs must enter </l>
        <l>But be advis'd. </l>
        <l>E'n give the Hero, and the Critique o'er, </l>
        <l>For Nature sent you on another score, </l>
        <l>Sho form'd her Beau, for nothing but her Whore. </l>

        <head>Prologue on the Third Day; Spoken by Mrs. Verbruggen. </head>
        <lg>
          <l>APologies for Plays, experience shews, </l>
          <l>are things almost as useless— as the Beaux. </l>
          <l>What e'er we say (like them) we neither move, </l>
          <l>Your Friendship, Pity, Anger, nor your Love, </l>
          <l>'Tis Interest turns the Globe: Let us but find, </l>
          <l>The way to please you, and you'll soon be kind: </l>
          <l>But to expect, you'd for our sakes approve, </l>
          <l>Is just as tho' you for their sakes shou'd Love, </l>
          <l>And that, we do confess, we think a Task, </l>
          <l>Which (tho' they may impose) we never ought to ask. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>This is an Age, where all things we improve, </l>
          <l>But most of all, the Art of Making Love. </l>
          <l>In former days, Women were only won, </l>
          <l>By Merit, Truth, and constant Service done, </l>
          <l>But Lovers now, are much more expert grown. </l>
          <l>They seldom wait, t'approach, by tedious Form, </l>
          <l>They'r for Dispatch, for taking you by Storm, </l>
          <l>Quick are their Sieges, furious are their Fires, </l>
          <l>Fierce their Attacks, and boundless their Desires. </l>
          <l>Before the Play's half ended, I'll engage, </l>
          <l>To shew you Beaux, come crowding on the Stage, </l>
          <l>Who with so little pains, have always sped, </l>
          <l>They'll undertake to look ●● Lady dead. </l>
          <l>How I have shook, and trembling stood with awe, </l>
          <l>When here, behind the Scenes, I've seen 'em draw. </l>
          <l>— A Comb: that dead doing Weapon ●● the Heart, </l>
          <l>And turn each powder'd Hair into a Dart. </l>
          <l>When I have seen 'em sally on the Stage, </l>
          <l>Drest to the War, and ready to engage. </l>
          <l>I've mourn'd your Destiny— yet more their Fate, </l>
          <l>To think, that after Victorys so great, </l>
          <l>It shou'd so often prove, their hard mishap, </l>
          <l>To sneak into a Lane— and get a Clap. </l>
          <l>But hush; they'r here already, I'll retire, </l>
          <l>And leave 'em to you Ladys to admire. </l>
          <l>They'll shew you Twenty thousand Airs and Graces, </l>
          <l>They'll entertain you with their soft Grimaces, </l>
          <l>Their Snuff-box, aukward Bows— and ugly Faces. </l>
          <l>In short, they'r after all, so much your Friends </l>
          <l>That lest the Play shou'd fail, the Authors ends, </l>
          <l>They have resolv'd, to make you some amends. </l>
          <l>Between each Act, (perform'd by nicest Rules, </l>
          <l>They'll Treat you— with an interlude of Fools. </l>
          <l>Of which, that you may have the deeper Sence, </l>
          <l>The Entertainment's— at their own Expence. </l>

Far Example, Madam, my Life: My Life, Madam, is a perpetual Stream of Pleasure, that glides through such a Variety of Entertainments, I believe the wisest of our Ancestors never had the least Conception of any of 'em. </p>
              <p>I rise, Madam, about Ten a-Clock. I don't rise sooner, because 'tis the worst thing in the World for the Complexion; nat that I pretend to be a Beau: But a Man must endeavour to look wholesome, lest he make so nauseous a Figure in the <pb n="29" xml:id="ep000780-019-b"/>Side-Bax, the Ladies shou'd be compell'd to turn their Eyes upon the Play. So at Ten a-Clack I say I rise. Naw if I find 'tis a good day, I resalve to take a turn in the Park, and see the Fine Women: So huddle on my Cloaths, and get drest by One. If it be nasty Weather, I take a turn in the Chocolate-hause; where, as you walk Madam, you have the prettiest Prospect in the World; you have Looking-glasses all round you.— But I'm afraid I tire the Company? </p>

              <p>Between eating my Dinner, (and washing my Mauth, Ladies) I spend my time, 'till I go to the Play; where, 'till Nine a-Clack, I entertain my self with looking upon the Company; and usually dispose of One hour more in leading 'em aut.

              <p>Why then I understand my Trade so well, that when ever I am told of a Man I like, I cry psha; but that I may spare you the pains of putting me a second time in mind to commend him, I'll proceed, and give you this account of him; that though 'tis possible he may have had Women with as good faces as your Ladyship's (no discredit to it neither) yet you must know your cautious Behaviour, with that reserve in your Humour, has given him his Death's wound; he mortally hates a Coquett, he says 'tis impossible to Love where we cannot esteem; and that no Woman can be esteem'd by a Man who has sense, if she makes her self cheap in the eye of a Fool. That Pride to a Woman, is as necessary as Humility to a Divine; and that far fetch'd, and dear bought, is meat for Gentlemen, as well as for Ladies— in short, that every Woman who has Beauty, may set a price upon her self, and that by under-selling the Market, they ruine the Trade. This is his Doctrine, how do you like it? </p>

              <p>No, that I'll grant you: But there are other Reasons to expect it: For you must know after all, Amanda; the Inconstancy we commonly see in Men of Brains, does not so much proceed from the uncertainty of their temper, as from the Misfortunes of their Love. A Man sees perhaps a hundred Women he likes well enough for an Intrigue, and away. But possibly, through the whole Course of his Life, does not find above one, who is exactly what he could wish her; now her, 'tis a thousand to one, he never gets. Either she is not to be had at all, (tho' that seldom happens you'l say) or he wants those opportunities that are necessary to gain her. Either she likes some body else much better than him, or uses him like a Dog, because he likes no body so well as her: Still something or other Fate claps in the way between them and the Woman they are capable of being fond of: And this makes them wander about, from Mistress to Mistress, like a Pilgrim from Town to Town, who every Night must have a fresh Lodging, and's in haste to be gone in the Morning. </p>
