    <opener>
     <salute>
      Gentlemen,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     FOR Incouragement of this Address to you my worthy Friends, I am oblidg'd to acknowledge, that a worthless Fruit, like this, stands no less indebted to the Courteous Gardner, that lent the warm Bed to rear it, then to the indulgent Palates that were so favourably pleased to relish it. Your Favour therefore that admitted it to the Stage, and the kind pardoning Audience that received it there, divide my equal Gratitude. I confess indeed, if I durst, (for there was no good will wanting,) I had the same itch with the greater Brothers of the Quill, of committing this pubish't Bawble into some Noble, protecting Hands; had not a riseing check of Grace, call'd a Blush, withheld me. I consider'd, possibly the highest Quality may forgive the loss of two short hours at a poor homely Entertainment, much easier then publickly admitting so mean a Trifle, Dedicated and laid at the Feet of Honour. The first of the two Favours is but a generous Condescension e'en passant. But the prefixing a great Name in lasting Print, before so undeserving a piece of scrible, is a Concession on their side too low, and and an Ambition on mine too aspireing. And therefore though I durst be bold with it on a Theatre, and make 'em all my Patrons there, my Confidence, the Talent of the &#9679;&#9679;ge, I wear not beyond my Dressing Room, and durst presume upon Quality no farther. To you therefore who were before kind to it, I now send it for Protection; and choose you Gentlemen, my Patrons, and on my word I know not where I cou'd have pick't out better, for to pride my self in the choice of your Protection, and give my Patrons their true Panegyrick. I must avow to the World, that if ever there were a true Mecaenas of Poetry, (at least in Modern Story,) that name properly and rightly belongs to none, Gentlemen, so much as your Selves; and to prove this just Honour no Complement, but your lawful due, (which indeed is more then the Laws of Dedication oblige me to,) if the Town wou'd allow me able to read, (as that they'll hardly do.) I'de venture to quote one stanza of Gondibert for my Justification, giving this Account of Poetry.
    </p>
    <q>
     <l>
      Oh! hireless Science, and of all, alone
     </l>
     <l>
      The Liberal! meanly the rest each State
     </l>
     <l>
      With Pension treats; but this depends on none;
     </l>
     <l>
      Whose worth they reverently forbear to rate.
     </l>
    </q>
    <pb xml:id="ep000687-003-a"/>
    <p>
     Now if the World has made so little Provision for the maintenance of the Muses, (as kind Davenants too true Oracle tells us,) I'm afraid upon due Examination, that little Bread they gather will be found almost all glean'd from a Theatre; one kind honest Actor, that frets and struts his hour upon the Stage (as the Immortal Shaksphear has it,) is possibly a greater Benefactor to the Muses, then the greatest Family of Grandees that run Pedigrees, and track Originals up from the Conquest.
    </p>
    <p>
     The time has been when as old Ben ended his Grace with God bless me, and God bless
     <hi>
      Ralph, viz.
     </hi>
     the honest Drawer that drew him good Sack. So some Modern Authors with the same Equity, might full as Pathetically have furnish'd out one Article of their Prayers, (not forgetting the present Props of the Stage) with God bless Mohun, and God bless Hart, the good Actors that got 'em their good third Days, and consequently more substantial Patrons then the greatest gay Name, in the Frontispiece of the proudest Dedication. Poetry thrives so little now, that I much fear the famous Suckling himself was mistaken in his own Laureat; for there are those wou'd be glad to find that kind rich Alderman, his Appollo gave the Bays to, that out of all his heaped Coffers, wou'd either give or lend, to the fairest of the nine Mendicant Sisters.
    </p>
    <p>
     No Gentlemen, the Pernassus bears no good Crop, but upon that part of it lying and scituate within your own Garden Walls; all the rest of it produces only that unprofitable growth, that 'tis scarce worth cultivating; all other Poetry (Dramatick only excepted,) turns to so little Account, that the Toyl's as hopeless as labouring for the Philosopher's Stone; the Undertaker is certain to get nothing by it, and if he's born to an Estate to bear his Expences in the Projection, his only comfort is, he shall not be undone by it. If therefore a few stragling Cions of Poetry now and then start up in the World, the Incouragement is so much your own, that they wholly root with you. And if the greatest Dons of Wit, that carry the highest merit with 'em, are in Honour oblig'd to this Confession; how much greater ought my Acknowledgments to be, who owe my Access to the Stage, meerly to your Act of Grace.
    </p>
    <p>
     In turning this dowdy Brat therefore into the World, a like bound to the Midwife, and the Godfathers: Your generous administring kindness in handing it into light, and the no less generous Audience for standing Vouchers for it, I take this Opportunity of publishing my self,

     THE Preface to the Reader.
    </head>
    <p>
     THE time was, upon the uniting of the two Theatres, that the reviveing of the old stock of Plays, so ingrost the study of the House, that the Poets lay dorment; and a new Play cou'd hardly get admittance, amongst the more precious pieces of Antiquity, that then waited to walk the Stage: And since the World runs all upon Extremes, as you had such a Scarcity of new ones then; 'tis Iustice you shou'd have as great a glut of them now: for this reason, this little Prig makes bold to thrust in with the Crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
     'Tis true, some of the Poets, the great Dramatick Professors, began to murmur, that such diminutive Interlopers as my self should be suffer'd, and cou'd scarce forbear railing at the Injustice of the Company, in indulging such inconsiderable Invaders of their Province, the Stage.
    </p>
    <p>
     Now, I think, my Masters, 'tis a little hard, that those greater first-rate Wits, shou'd come with top and Top Gallant, and thunder their Broad sides amongst you, and a poor little
     <hi>
      Fan Fan
     </hi>
     should be denied giving the Town a small Pot-Gun.
    </p>
    <p>
     Besides, they have more Cause to be pleased at the exposing of so witless a trifle as this, if 'twere no more than for a Foil to their own more exalted Sence; for Faith some of 'em need one.
    </p>
    <p>
     After this Apology for their Favors; I am affraid, kind Reader, I shall find it a harder Task to Court yours; however, to make some Essay towards it; First I must tell you, that it if the Play wants Language, or any thing else, (or rather all things) to please you, nevertheless to take the modish way of Prefacing, and not undervalue my self: I assure you, (to the Credit of the Author be it spoken,) 'tis the best I ever writ; and By Gad, (as my Brother Bayes says,) I cou'd not have took more Pains about it, had I been to have had
     <hi>
      Six-score Pounds
     </hi>
     for it at a Venture: Besides, whatever Confidence I may be taxt with, to shew what respect I owe you, I resolved when I writ it to use a Conscience in persecuting you, and accordingly you'll find, I shall not tire my Reader with over much length; the Bookseller was in no danger of swelling the Play to
     <hi>
      Price two Shillings
     </hi>
     , and shall be thankful if he finds his Accounts in half the Summ.
    </p>
    <pb xml:id="ep000687-004-a"/>
    <p>
     So much for my Conscience, now for my Civility: Look ye good Friends, considering that greater Bodies move slow, and the other weightier, massier Sense, now in Rehearsal, and Study, cou'd not so easily be hammer'd into the Players Heads, nor got up fast enough; I resolv'd the Town showd not be so disoblig'd, as to have a whole Hillary-Term with never a new Play; and so I understudy'd, and jirckt up my little Whipster: This lighter toy, like a Dance between the Acts, in pure Complausance. I could instance several other Obligations of this kind, but not willing to insist too much upon Merit, for fear of running up into Supererrogation, I am content to end with subscribing my self

     MY Friend, against my will, puts this Complement upon me, had he not been a particular Acquaintance, and a Brother-Actor, I shou'd have took it as an Affront; yet though he writ it, I dare swear neither you nor I think it; and so take it among ye.

     NEW Plays is still the Cry of the whole Town,
    </l>
    <l>
     Therefore to day, young Powell gives you one;
    </l>
    <l>
     The fellow never writ before this time,
    </l>
    <l>
     And I am come to plead his Cause in Rhime;
    </l>
    <l>
     You may be sure that writing is grown scarce,
    </l>
    <l>
     When he sets up for Prose, and I for Verse;
    </l>
    <l>
     Variety of Plays, like Women, all
    </l>
    <l>
     Desire, and both, when had, grow dull:
    </l>
    <l>
     Women and Plays are both uncertain too,
    </l>
    <l>
     We cannot swear they'r sound, till try'd by you;
    </l>
    <l>
     If a Play's bad, 'tis but three hours enduring,
    </l>
    <l>
     But Women often cost you three months curing;
    </l>
    <l>
     From an ill Play, each to the Tavern runs,
    </l>
    <l>
     Cursing the Poet, and his memory drowns,
    </l>
    <l>
     Drinking Damnation to him in six go downs.
    </l>
    <l>
     Our Scribler don't at all you sharp Wits dread,
    </l>
    <l>
     He writes as Bullies fight, not for Renown, but Bread;
    </l>
    <l>
     Ive heard there goes a curse with Poetry,
    </l>
    <l>
     Which many Authors know, call'd Poverty.
    </l>
    <l>
     But as for Players,
    </l>
    <l>
     They can no greater curse then being Players deserve,
    </l>
    <l>
     For write or not write, we are sure to to starve;
    </l>
    <l>
     You all are leaving us to serve the Nation,
    </l>
    <l>
     Our men and we shall have a long Vacation;
