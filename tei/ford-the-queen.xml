        <p>MAdam, Imbolden'd by your accustomed candor and unmerited favours to things of the like nature, though disproportion'd worth: (Because this Excellency seems to contract those perfections her Sex hath been invested with, which are as essential to your Ladiship, as light to the Sun) I presumed to secure this innocent Orphan from the Thunder-shocks of the present blasting age, under the safe protecting wreath of your name; which (I am confident) the vertues of none can more justly challenge, then those of your Ladiship; who alone may seem to quicken the lifeless Scene, and to demonstrate its possibility; reducing Fables into Practicks; by making as great honour <pb xml:id="ep000689-003-a"/>visible in the mirror of your dayly practise. Your pardon, Madam, for daring to offer such adulterate Metals, to so pure a Mine; for making the Shadow a present to the Substance; the thoughts of which was an offence, but the performance, a crime beyond the hopes of pardon. When my Fate had cast me on the first, I esteemed my self unsafe (with the Politian) should I not attempt the latter, securing one error by soaring at a greater: but my duller eyes endured not the proof of so glorious a Test, and the waxed juncture of my ill contrived feathers melt me into the fear of a fall: Therefore (with the most desperate offenders) I cast my self on the mercy of the Bench; and since I have so clement a Judge as your self, do not wholly despair of absolution, by reason my Penetential acknowledgment attones part of the offence; and your remission of the whole will eternally oblige, </p>

          <l>GOUGHE, In this little Present you create </l>
          <l>Your self a Trophee, may become a State; </l>
          <l>For you that preserve wit, may equally </l>
          <l>Be ranck'd with those defend our Liberty; </l>
          <l>And though in this ill treated Scene of sense, </l>
          <l>The general learning is but in pretence; </l>
          <l>Or else infus'd like th' Eastern Prophet's Dove, </l>
          <l>To whisper us, Religion, Honour, Love; </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000689-004-b"/>
          <l>Yet the more Generous race of men revives </l>
          <l>This Lamp of Knowledge, and like Primitives </l>
          <l>In Caves, fearless of Martyrdom, rehearse </l>
          <l>The almost breathless, now, Dramatick verse. </l>
          <l>How in the next age will our Youth lament </l>
          <l>The loss of wit, condem'd to banishment. </l>
          <l>Wit that the duller rout despise, cause they </l>
          <l>Miss it in what their Zealous Priests display: </l>
          <l>For Priests in melancholy Zeal admit </l>
          <l>Onely a grave formality for wit; </l>
          <l>And would have those that govern us comply </l>
          <l>And cherish their fallacious tyranny. </l>
          <l>But wherein States can no advantage gain, </l>
          <l>They harmless mirth improperly restrain; </l>
          <l>Since men cannot be naturally call'd free, </l>
          <l>If Rulers claim more then securitie. </l>
          <l>How happens then this rigour o're the Stage </l>
          <l>In this restor'd, free, and licentious age? </l>
          <l>For Plays are Images of life, and cheat </l>
          <l>Men into vertue, and in jest repeat </l>
          <l>What they most seriously think; nor may </l>
          <l>We fear lest Manners suffer: every day </l>
          <l>Does higher, cunninger, more sin invent </l>
          <l>Then any Stage did ever represent. </l>
          <l>It may indeed shew evil, and affright, </l>
          <l>As we prize day by th' ugliness of night. </l>
          <l>But in the Theatre men are easier caught, </l>
          <l>Then by what is in clamorous pulpits taught. </l>

But with all (and herin I appeale to your Majesties own approbation) I season'd my words with such an intermixing the praises of the Queens bewty, that from jealosy.

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
