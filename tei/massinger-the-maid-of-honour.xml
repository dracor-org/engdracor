        <p>THat you have beene, and continued so for many yeeres (since you vouchsafed to owne me) Patrons to me and my despised studies, I cannot but with all humble thankefulnesse acknowledge: And living, as you have done, inseparable in your friendship (notwithstanding all differences, and suites in Law arising betweene you) I held it as impertinent, as absurd, in the presentment of my service in this kinde, to divide you. A free confession of a debt in a meaner man, is the amplest satisfaction to his superiours, and I heartily wish, that the world may take notice, and from my selfe, that I had not to this time subsisted, but that I was supported by your frequent courtesies, and favours, when your more serious occasions will give you leave, you may please to peruse this trifle, and peradventure find somthing in it that may appeare worthy of your protection.
