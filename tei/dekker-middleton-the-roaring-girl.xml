        <head>To the Comicke, Play-readers, Venery, and Laughter. </head>
        <p>THE fashion of play-making, I can properly compare to nothing, so naturally, as the alteration in apparell: For in the time of the Great-crop-doublet, your huge bombasted plaies, quilted with mighty words to leane purpose was onely then in fashion. And as the doublet fell, neater inuentions beganne to set vp. Now in the time of sprucenes, our plaies followe the nicenes of our Garments, single plots, quaint conceits, letcherous iests, drest vp in hanging sleeues, and those are fit for the Times, and the Tearmers: Such a kind of light-colour Summer stuffe, mingled with diuerse colours, you shall finde this published Comedy, good to keepe you in an afternoone from dice, at home in your chambers; and for venery you shall finde enough, for sixepence, but well coucht and you marke it. For Venus being a woman passes through the play in doublet and breeches, a braue disguise and a safe one, if the Statute vnty not her cod-peece point. The book I make no question, but is fit for many of your companies, as well as the person itselfe, and may bee allowed both Gallery roome at the play-house, and chamber-roome at your lodging: worse things I must needs confesse the world <pb xml:id="ep000199-003-a"/>ha's taxt her for, then has beene written of her; but 'tis the excellency of a Writer, to leaue things better then he finds 'em; though some obscoene fellow (that cares not what he writes against others, yet keepes a mysticall baudy-house himselfe, and entertaines drunkards, to make vse of their pockets, and vent his priuate bottle-ale at mid-night) though such a one would haue ript vp the most nasty vice, that euer hell belcht forth, and presented it to a modest Assembly; yet we rather wish in such discoueries, where reputation lies bleeding, a slackenesse of truth, then fulnesse of slander. </p>

          <l>A Play (expected long) makes the Audience looke </l>
          <l>For wonders:— that each Scoene should be a booke, </l>
          <l>Compos'd to all perfection; each one comes </l>
          <l>And brings a play in's head with him: vp he summes, </l>
          <l>What he would of a Roaring Girle haue writ; </l>
          <l>If that he findes not here, he mewes at it. </l>
          <l>Onely we intreate you thinke our Scoene. </l>
          <l>Cannot speake high (the subiect being but meane) </l>
          <l>A Roaring Girle (whose notes till now neuer were) </l>
          <l>Shall fill with laughter our vast Theater, </l>
          <l>That's all which I dare promise: Tragick passion, </l>
          <l>And such graue stuffe, is this day out of fashion. </l>
          <l>I see attention sets wide ope her gates </l>
          <l>Of hearing, and with couetous listning waites, </l>
          <l>To know what Girle, this Roaring Girle should be. </l>
          <l>(For of that Tribe are many.) One is shee </l>
          <l>That roares at midnight in deepe Tauerne bowles, </l>
          <l>That beates the watch, and Constables controuls; </l>
          <l>Another roares i'th day time, sweares, stabbes, giues braues, </l>
          <l>Yet sells her soule to the lust of fooles and slaues. </l>
          <l>Both these are Suburbe-roarers. Then there's (besides) </l>
          <l>A ciuill Citty Roaring Girle, whose pride, </l>
          <l>Feasting, and riding, shakes her husbands state, </l>
          <l>And leaues him Roaring through an yron grate. </l>
          <l>None of these Roaring Girles is ours: shee flies </l>
          <l>With wings more lofty. Thus her character lyes, </l>
          <l>Yet what neede characters? when to giue a gesse, </l>
          <l>Is better then the person to expresse; </l>
          <l>But would you know who 'tis? would you heare her name? </l>
          <l>Shee is cal'd madde Moll; her life, our acts proclaime. </l>
