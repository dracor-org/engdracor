        <l>I Cannot choose but laugh, when I look back and see </l>
        <l>The strange Vicissitudes of Poetrie. </l>
        <l>Your Aged Fathers came to Plays for Wit, </l>
        <l>And sat Knee-deep in Nut-shells in the Pit. </l>
        <l>Course Hangings then in stead of Scenes were worn, </l>
        <l>And Kidderminster did the Stage Adorn. </l>
        <l>But you, their wiser Off-spring, do advance </l>
        <l>To Plot of Gigg; and to Dramatique Dance: </l>
        <l>But when the Reign of Gigg and Dance is past, </l>
        <l>Whither the Devil will you go at last </l>
        <l>What yet unheard-of Way can Poets try, </l>
        <l>To please these Modern Criticks of the eye: </l>
        <l>There's one Way left, as when ill Husbands Range, </l>
        <l>The come at last to their own Wives for change; </l>
        <l>So you your Surfet of old Wit now past, </l>
        <l>May come to taste it with new Gust at last. </l>
        <l>And having through all Usurpations run, </l>
        <l>May fix upon the King, where you begun. </l>

        <head>THE EPILOGUE. </head>
        <l>ALL their Beginning know, but none their End, </l>
        <l>And with that Fate we on your Votes depend. </l>
        <l>Though there I see— Propitious Angels sit, </l>
        <stage xml:id="ep000495-e460">[points at the Boxes </stage>
        <l>Still there's a Nest of Devils in the Pit, </l>
        <l>By whom our Plays, like Children, just alive, </l>
        <l>Pinch'd by the Fairies, never after thrive: </l>
        <l>'Tis but your Half-crown, Sirs: that won't undo; </l>
        <l>Besides, let others lose't as well as you. </l>
        <l>Birds caught in Lime, or fool'd into a Gyn, </l>
        <l>By chirping on still draw Companions in: </l>
        <l>Ginneys depart at Shutland for a Meal </l>
        <l>Of ill Pottage, and rotten Roasted Teal. </l>
        <l>From thence you came inflam'd into the Pit, </l>
        <l>And nothing pleases your Burgundy Wit; </l>
        <l>Censure is grown, not judgment now, but fashion, </l>
        <l>And your ill Nature spoils your Recreation. </l>
        <l>So doth an Entertainer marr his Feast, </l>
        <l>With one o're-critical and peevish Guest. </l>
        <l>As Woman let me with the Men prevail, </l>
        <l>And with the Ladies as I look like Male. </l>
        <l>'Tis worth your Money that such Legs appear; </l>
        <l>These are not to be seen so cheap elsewhere: </l>
        <l>In short commend this Play, or by this light, </l>
        <l>We will not sup with one of you to night. </l>
