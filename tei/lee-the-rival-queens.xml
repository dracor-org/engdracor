      My Lord,
     </salute>
    </opener>
    <p>
     WHEN I hear by many Persons, not indifferent Judges, how Poets are censur'd most, even where they most intend to please; and sometimes by those to whom they address, condemn'd for Flatterers, Sycophants, little fawning wretches, I confess of all undertakings, there is none more dreadful to me than a Dedication. So nicely cruel are our Judges, that after a Play has been generally applauded on the Stage, the Industrious malice of some after Observers shall damn it for an Epistle, or a Preface. For this Reason, my Lord, Alexander was more to seek for a Patron in my troubl'd thoughts, than for the Temple of
     <hi>
      Jupiter Ammon
     </hi>
     in the spreading Wilds, and rowling Sands. 'Tis certain too he must have been lost, had not Fortune, whom I must once, at least, acknowledge kind in my Life, presented me to your Lordship: You were pleas'd, my Lord, to read it
     <pb xml:id="ep000624-003-a"/>
     over, Act by Act, and by particular praises, proceeding from the sweetness, rather than the justice, of your temper, lifted me up from my natural Melancholy, and Diffidence, to a bold belief, that what so great an understanding warranted, could not fail of success. And here I were most ungrateful, if I should not satisfie the judging World of the surprize I was in. Pardon me, my Lord, for calling it a surprize, when I was first honour'd by waiting upon your Lordship: So much unexpected, and indeed, unusual affability from Persons of your Birth, and Quality; so true an Easiness, such Frankness, without affectation, I never saw. Your constant, but few Friends, show the firmness of your Mind, which never varies, so God-like a Virtue, that a Prince puts off His Majesty, when he parts with Resolution. In all the happy times, that I attended you, unless business, or accident, interpos'd, I have observ'd your Company to be the same. You have Travell'd through all tempers, Sail'd through all humours of the Courts unconstant Sea, you have gain'd the gallant Prizes, which you sought, your selected, unvaluable Friends: And I am perfectly perswaded, if you traffick but seldome abroad, 'tis for fear of splitting upon Knaves, or Fools. Nor is it Pride, but rather a Delicacie of your Soul, that makes you shun the Sordid part of the World, the lees and Dregs of it, while in the noblest Retirement you enjoy the finer Spirits, and have that just Greatness to be above the baser. How commendable therefore is such Reservation; how admirable such a Solitude! If you are singular in this, we ought to blame the wild, unthinking, dissolute Age; an Age, whose business is senseless Riot, Neronian Gambols, and ridiculous Debauchery; an Age that can produce few Persons, beside your Lordship, who dare be alone. All our hot hours,
     <pb xml:id="ep000624-003-b"/>
     burn't in Night-Revells, or drown'd in Day-dead-sleep; or if we wake, 'tis a point of reeling Honour joggs us to the Field, where, if we live, or dye, we are not concern'd; for, the Soul was laid out before we went abroad, and our Bodies were after acted, by meer Animal Spirits, without Reason. When I more narrowly Contemplate your Person, methinks I see in your Lordship two of the most famous Characters, that ever Ancient, or Modern, Story could produce; the mighty Scipio, and the retir'd Cowley. You have certainly the Gravity, Temperance, and Judgment, as well as the Courage, of the first; all which, in your early attempts of War, gave the noblest dawn of Virtue; and will, when occasion presents, answer our expectation, and shine forth at full. Then, for the latter, you possess all his sweetness of humour in peace, all that Halcyon Tranquillity of Mind, where your deep thoughts glide, like silent Waters, without a Wrinkle, your hours move with softest Wings, and rarely any Larum strikes to discompose you. You have the Philosophy of the first, and which, I confess, of all your qualities, I love most, the Poetry of the latter. I was never more mov'd at Virgil's Dido, than at a short Poem of your Lordships; where nothing but the shortness can be dislik'd. As our Church-Men wish there were more Noble Men of their Function, so wish I, in the behalf of deprest Poetry, that there were more Poets of your Lordships Excellence, and Eminence. If Poetry be a Virtue, she is a ragged one; and never, in any Age, went barer than now. It may be objected, she never deserved less. To that I must not answer; but I am sure, when she merited most, she was alwayes dissatisfied, or she would not have forsaken the most splendid Courts in the World. Virgil, and Horace, Favourites of the mightiest Emperour,
     <pb xml:id="ep000624-004-a"/>
     retir'd from him, preferring a Mistress, or a white Boy, and two or three cheerful drinking Friends, in a Country Village, to all the Magnificence of Rome: Or if sometimes they were snatch'd from their cooler pleasures to an Emperial Banquet, We may see by their Verses in praise of the Country Life, 'twas against their Inclination; Witness, Horace in his
     <hi>
      Epod. Beat us ille qui procul,
     </hi>
     &amp;c. part of his sixth Satyr, his Epistle to
     <hi>
      Fuscus Aristius; Virgil's Georgie, O Fortunatos nimium bona si,
     </hi>
     &amp;c. All render'd by Mr. Cowley, so Copiously, and Naturally, as no Age gone before, or coming after, shall equal, though all Heads join'd together to out. do him. I speak not of his exactness to a Line, but of the whole. This then may be said, as to the condition of Poets in all times, few ever arriv'd to a middle Fortune, most have liv'd at the lowest, none ever mounted to the highest; neither by Birth, for none was ever born a Prince, as no Prince, to my remembrance, was ever born a Poet; nor by Industry, because they were alwayes too much transported by their own thoughts from minding the grave business of a World, not of their humour: Whereas, even Slaves, the Rubbish of the Earth have, by most prodigious Fortune, gain'd a Scepter, and with their vile Heads, sully'd the glories of a Crown. Praise is the greatest encouragement we Camelions can pretend to, or rather the Manna that keeps Soul and Body together; we devour it as if it were Angels Food, and vainly think we grow Immortal. For my own part, I acknowledge, I never receiv'd a better satisfaction from the applause of an Audience than I have from your single Judgment. You gaze at Beauties, and wink at Blemishes; and do both so gracefully, that the first discovers the acuteness of your Judgment, the other the excellency of your Nature.
     <pb xml:id="ep000624-004-b"/>
     And I can affirm, to your Lordship, there is nothing transports a Poet, next to Love, like commending in the right place. Therefore, my Lord, this Play must be yours; and Alexander, whom I have rais'd from the dead, comes to you with an assurance, answerable to his Character, and your Virtue. You cannot expect him in his Majesty of two thousand Years ago, I have only put his illustrious Ashes in an Urne, which are now offer'd, with all observance, to your Lordship. By,

     To Mr. Lee, on his Alexander.
    </head>
    <l>
     <hi>
      THE Blast of common Censure cou'd I fear,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Before your Play my Name shou'd not appear
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      For 'twill be thought, and with some colour too,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      I pay the Bribe I first receiv'd from You:
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      That mutual Vouchers for our Fame we stand,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      To play the Game into each others Hand
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      And as cheap Pen'orths to our selves afford
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     As Bessus,
     <hi>
      and the Brothers of the Sword.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Such Libels private Men may well endure,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      When States, and Kings themselves are not secure:
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      For ill Men, conscious of their inward guilt,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Think the best Actions on By-ends are built.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      And yet my silence had not scap'd their spight,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Then envy had not suffer'd me to write:
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      For, since I cou'd not Ignorance pretend,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Such worth I must or envy or commend.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      So many Candidates there stand for Wit,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      A place in Court is scarce so hard to get
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      In vain they croud each other at the Door
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      For ev'n Reversions are all beg'd before:
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Desert, how known so e're, is long delay'd
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      And, then too, Fools and Knaves are better pay'd.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Yet, as some Actions bear so great a Name,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      That Courts themselves are just, for fear of shame:
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      So has the mighty Merit of your Play
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Extorted praise, and forc'd it self a Way.
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      'Tis here, as 'tis at Sea; who farthest goes,
     </hi>
    </l>
    <l>
     <hi>
      Or dares the most, makes all the rest his Foes
     </hi>
     ;
    </l>
    <pb xml:id="ep000624-006-a"/>
    <l>
     Yet, when some Virtue much out-grows the rest,
    </l>
    <l>
     It shoots too fast, and high, to be opprest;
    </l>
    <l>
     As his Heroic worth struck Envy dumb
    </l>
    <l>
     Who took the Dutchman, and who cut the Boom:
    </l>
    <l>
     Such praise is yours, while you the Passions move,
    </l>
    <l>
     That 'tis no longer feign'd; 'tis real Love:
    </l>
    <l>
     Where Nature Triumphs over wretched Art;
    </l>
    <l>
     We only warm the Head, but you the Heart.
    </l>
    <l>
     Alwayes you warm! and if the rising Year,
    </l>
    <l>
     As in hot Regions, bring the Sun too near,
    </l>
    <l>
     Tis but to make your Fragrant Spices blow,
    </l>
    <l>
     Which in our colder Climates will not grow.
    </l>
    <l>
     They only think you animate your Theme
    </l>
    <l>
     With too much Fire, who are themselves all Phle'me:
    </l>
    <l>
     Prizes wou'd be for Lags of slowest pace,
    </l>
    <l>
     Were Cripples made the Judges of the Race.
    </l>
    <l>
     Despise those Drones, who praise while they accuse
    </l>
    <l>
     The too much vigour of your youthful Muse:
    </l>
    <l>
     That humble Stile which they their Virtue make
    </l>
    <l>
     Is in your pow'r; you need but stoop and take.
    </l>
    <l>
     Your beauteous Images must be allow'd
    </l>
    <l>
     By all, but some vile Poets of the Crowd;
    </l>
    <l>
     But how shou'd any Sign-post-dawber know
    </l>
    <l>
     The worth of Titian, or of Angelo?
    </l>
    <l>
     Hard Features every Bungler can command;
    </l>
    <l>
     To draw true Beauty shews a Masters Hand.

     PROLOGUE TO ALEXANDER,
    </head>
    <byline>
     Written by Sir
     <hi>
      Char. Scroop
     </hi>
     , Baronet.

    <l>
     HOW hard the Fate is, of that Scribling Drudge,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who writes to all, when yet so few can judge!
    </l>
    <l>
     Wit, like Religion, once Divine was thought;
    </l>
    <l>
     And the dull Crowd believ'd, as they were taught:
    </l>
    <l>
     Now each Fanatick Fool presumes t'explain
    </l>
    <l>
     The Text, and does the sacred Writ prophane:
    </l>
    <l>
     For, while you Wits each others Fall pursue,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Fops usurp the Power belongs to you.
    </l>
    <l>
     You think y'are challeng'd in each new Play-bill,
    </l>
    <l>
     And here you come for tryal of your Skill;
    </l>
    <l>
     Where, Fencer-like, you one another hurt,
    </l>
    <l>
     While, with your Wounds, you make the Rabble sport.
    </l>
    <l>
     Others there are, that have the bruital Will
    </l>
    <l>
     To Murder a poor Play, but want the Skill.
    </l>
    <l>
     They love to fight, but seldome have the Wit
    </l>
    <l>
     To spye the Place, where they may thrust and hit;
    </l>
    <l>
     And therefore, like some Bully of the Town,
    </l>
    <l>
     Ne're stand to draw, but knock the Poet down.
    </l>
    <l>
     With these, like Hogs in Gardens it succeeds,
    </l>
    <l>
     They root up all, and know not Flowers from Weeds.
    </l>
    <l>
     As for you, Sparks, that hither come each day
    </l>
    <l>
     To Act your own, and not to mind our Play;
    </l>
    <l>
     Rehearse your usual follies to the Pit,
    </l>
    <l>
     And with loud Non-sense drown the Stages Wit:
    </l>
    <l>
     Talk of your Cloaths, your last Debauches tell,
    </l>
    <l>
     And witty Bargains to each other sell;
    </l>
    <pb xml:id="ep000624-007-a"/>
    <l>
     Gloat on the silly She, who for your sake
    </l>
    <l>
     Can Vanity, and Noise, for Love mistake
    </l>
    <l>
     'Till the Cocquet, sung in the next Lampoon,
    </l>
    <l>
     Is by her jealous Friends sent out of Town.
    </l>
    <l>
     For, in this Duelling Intriguing) Age,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Love you make is like the War you wage;
    </l>
    <l>
     Y'are still prevented e're you come t'ingage.
    </l>
    <l>
     But 'tis not to such trisling Foes as you,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Mighty Alexander daigns to sue:
    </l>
    <l>
     You Persians of the Pit he does despise,
    </l>
    <l>
     But to the Men of Sence, for Aid, he flies;
    </l>
    <l>
     On their experienc'd Arms he now depends,
    </l>
    <l>
     Nor fears he odds, if they but prove his Friends:
    </l>
    <l>
     For as he once, a little handful chose,
    </l>
    <l>
     The numerous Armies of the World t'oppose,
    </l>
    <l>
     So back'd by you, who understand the Rules,
    </l>
    <l>
     He hopes to rout the Mighty Host of Fools.

     EPILOGUE to Alexander the Great,
    </head>
    <l>
     WHAT e're they mean, yet ought they to be curst,
    </l>
    <l>
     Who this Censorious Age did polish first:
    </l>
    <l>
     Who the best Play, for one poor Errour blame,
    </l>
    <l>
     As Priests against our Ladies Arts declaim,
    </l>
    <l>
     And for one Patch, both Soul and Body damn.
    </l>
    <l>
     But what does more provoke the Actors rage,
    </l>
    <l>
     (For we must show the grievance of the Stage)
    </l>
    <l>
     Is, that our Women who adorn each Play
    </l>
    <l>
     Bred at our cost, become at length your Prey:
    </l>
    <l>
     While green, and sour, likes Trees we bear 'em all,
    </l>
    <l>
     But when they're mellow straight to you they fall:
    </l>
    <l>
     You watch 'em bare and squab, and let 'em rest;
    </l>
    <l>
     But with the first young down, you snatch the Nest.
    </l>
    <l>
     Pray leave these poaching tricks, if you are wise,
    </l>
    <l>
     E're we take out our Letters of Reprize.
    </l>
    <l>
     For we have vow'd to find a sort of Toys
    </l>
    <l>
     Known to black Fryars, a Tribe of choopping Boys:
    </l>
    <l>
     If once they come, they'l quickly spoil your sport;
    </l>
    <l>
     There's not one Lady will receive your Court:
    </l>
    <l>
     But for the Youth in Petticoats run wild,
    </l>
    <l>
     With oh the archest Wagg, the sweetest Child.
    </l>
    <l>
     The panting Breasts, white Hands and little Feet
    </l>
    <l>
     No more shall your pall'd thoughts with pleasure meet.
    </l>
    <l>
     The Woman in Boys Cloaths, all Boy shall be,
    </l>
    <l>
     And never raise your thoughts above the Knee.
    </l>
    <l>
     Well, if our Women knew how false you are,
    </l>
    <l>
     They wou'd stay here, and this new trouble spare:
    </l>
    <l>
     Poor Souls, they think all Gospel you relate,
    </l>
    <l>
     Charm'd with the noise of sett'ling an Estate:
    </l>
    <l>
     But when, at last, your Appetites are full,
    </l>
    <l>
     And the tir'd Cupid grows, with action, dull;
    </l>
    <l>
     You'l find some trick to cut off the Entail,
    </l>
    <l>
     And send 'em back to us, all worn and stale.
    </l>
    <pb xml:id="ep000624-041-a"/>
    <l>
     Perhaps they'l find our Stage, while they have rang'd
    </l>

    </l>
    <l>
     Where, for the Sparks who once resorted there

     With their curl'd Wigs that scented all the Air,

     They'l see grave Blockheads with short greasie Hair.
    </l>
    <l>
     Green-Aprons, steeple-Hats, and Collar-Bands;
    </l>
    <l>
     Dull sniv'ling Rogues that wring, not clap, their Hands:
    </l>
    <l>
     Where, for gay Punks that drew the shining Crowd,
    </l>
    <l>
     And Misses that, in Vizard, laught aloud;
    </l>
    <l>
     They'l hear young Sisters sigh, see Matrons old
    </l>
    <l>
     To their chop't Cheeks their pick'led Kerchers hold;
    </l>
    <l>
     Whose Zeal too, might perswade, in spight to you,
    </l>
    <l>
     Our flying Angels, to augment their Crew:
    </l>
    <l>
     While Farringdon their Hero struts about 'em,
    </l>
    <l>
     And ne're a damning Critick dares to flout 'em.
