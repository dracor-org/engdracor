        <l>Or wherefore will your profest writer be </l>
        <l>(Not tax'd of theft before) a Plagary? </l>
        <l>To this he answers in his just defence, </l>
        <l>And to maintaine to all our Innocence, </l>
        <l>Thus much, though he hath travel'd the same way, </l>
        <l>Demanding, and receiving too the pay </l>
        <l>For a new Poem, you may find it due, </l>
        <l>He having neither cheated us, nor you; </l>
        <l>He vowes, and deeply, that he did not spare </l>
        <l>The utmost of his strengths, and his best care </l>
        <l>In the reviving it, and though his powers </l>
        <l>Could not as he desired, in three short howers </l>
        <l>Contract the Subject, and much lesse expresse </l>
        <l>The changes, and the various passages </l>
        <l>That will he look'd for, you may heare this day </l>
        <l>Some Scaenes that will confirme it is a play, </l>

        <head>Textual Notes</head>
        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
