        <head>The Subject of the MASQVE. </head>
        <p>DIscord a malicious Fury, appeares in a storme, and by the Invocation of malignant spirits, proper to her evill use, having already put most of the world into disorder, endeavours to disturbe these parts, envying the blessings and Tranquility we have long enjoyed. </p>
        <p>These Incantations are expressed by those spirits in an Antimasque: who on a sudden are surprised, and stopt in their motion by a secret power, whose wisedome they tremble at, and depart as foreknowing, that Wisedome will change all their malicious hope of these disorders into a sudden calme, which after their departure is prepared by a disperst Harmony of Musique. </p>
        <p>This secret Wisdome in the Person of the King attended by his Nobles, and under the name of Philogenes or Lover of his People, hath his appearance prepared by a Chorus, representing the <pb xml:id="ep000366-003-a"/>beloved people, and is instantly discovered, environed with those Nobles in the throne of Honour. </p>
        <p>Then the Queene personating the chiefe Heroin, with her martiall Ladies, is sent downe from Heaven by Pallas as a Reward of his Prudence, for reducing the threatning storme into the following calme. </p>

        <p>IN the border that enclosed the Sceans and made a frontispice to all the worke, in a square Neech on the right hand stood two figures of women, one of them expressing much majesty in her aspect, apparelled in sky colour with a crowne of gold on her head, and a bridle in her hand, representing Reason: the other embracing her was in changeable silke with wings at her shoulders, figured for intellectuall Appetite, who while she imbraceth Reason, all the actions of men are rightly governed. Above these in a second order, were winged children, one riding on a furious Lion, which hee seemes to tame with reynes and a bit: Another bearing an Antique ensigne: the third hovering above with a branch of Palme in his hand, expressing the victory over the Perturbations. In a Neech on the other side stood two figures joyning hands, one a grave old man in a robe of purple, with a heart of gold in a chayne about his necke, figured for Counsell; the other a woman, in a garment of cloth of gold, in her hand a sword with a serpent winding about the blade, representing Resolution, both these being necessary to the good meanes of arriving to a vertuous end. </p>
        <p>Over these and answering to the other side was a round Altar raysed high, and on it the bird of Pallas, figured for Prudence: on eyther side were children with wings, one in act of Adoration, another holding a booke, and a third flying over their heads with a lighted Torch in his hand, representing the intellectuall light accompanied with Doctrine and Discipline, and alluding to the figures below, as those on the other side. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000366-004-a"/>
        <p>Above these ran a large Freese, with a Cornicement: in the midst wherof was a double Compartiment rich and full of ornament: on the top of this sate Fame with spreaded wings, in act, sounding a Trumpet of gold: joyning to the Compartiment in various postures lay two Figures in their naturall colours as big as the life; one holding an Anchor representing safety; the other expressing Riches, with a Cornu-copia; and about her stood Antique vases of gold. The rest of this Freese was composed of Children, with significant signes to expresse their severall qualities; Forgetfulnesse of injuries, extinguishing a flaming torch on an Armor; Commerce, with eares of Corne; Felicity, with a basket of Lillies; Affection to the Countrey, holding a Grashopper; Prosperous successe, with the Rudder of a Ship; Innocence, with a branch of Fearne: All these expressing the severall goods, followers of peace and Concord, and fore-runners of humane felicity: so as the worke of this Front consisting of Picture qualified with morall Philosophy, temper'd delight with profit. </p>
        <p>In the midst of the aforesaid Compartiment in an Ovall Table was written. </p>
        <quote>SALMACIDA SPOLIA. </quote>
        <p>The Ancient Adagies are these. </p>

          <l>Salmacida Spolia sine sanguine sine sudore, potius quam. </l>
          <l>Cadmia victoria, ubi ipsos victores pernicies opprimit. </l>

        <pb xml:id="ep000366-004-b"/>
        <p>But before I proceed in the descriptions of the Sceanes, it is not amisse briefly to set downe the Histories from whence these Proverbs tooke their originall. </p>
        <p>For the first Melas and Arevanias of Argos, and Troezen conducted a common Colony to Habicarnassus in Asia, and there drave out the barbarous Carie and Lelegi, who fled up to the Mountaines; from whence they made many incursions, robbing and cruelly spoyling the Grecian Inhabitants, which could by no meanes be prevented. </p>
        <p>On the top of the right horne of the hill which surrounds Halicarnassus, in forme of a Theater, is a famous Fountaine of most cleare water, and exquisite taste called Salmacis: It happened that neere to this Fountaine one of the Colony (to make gaine by the goodnesse of the water) set up a Taverne, and furnish'd it with all necessaries, to which the Barbarians resorting (entised by the delicious taste of this water, at first some few, and after many together in troops,) of fierce and cruell natures, were reduced of their owne accord to the sweetnesse of the Grecian customes. </p>
        <p>The other Adage is thus derived. </p>
        <p>The Citie of Thebes, anciently called Cadmia, had warre with Adrastus, the Argive King, who raised a great Army of Arcadians and Missenians, and fought a battaile with them neere Ismenia, where the Thebans were overthrowne, turned their backs, and fled into their City; the Peloponnesians (not accustomed to skale walled Townes) assaulting furiously, but <pb xml:id="ep000366-005-a"/>without order, were repulst from the walls by the defendants, and may of the Argives slaine: at that instant the besieged making a great sally, and finding the enemy in disorder and confusion, cut them all in pieces, onely Adrastus excepted, who was saved by flight: but this victory was gotten with great damage and slaughter of the Thebans, for few of them returned alive into their City. </p>
        <p>The allusion is, That his Majesty out of his mercy and clemency approoving the first Proverbe, seekes by all meanes to reduce tempestuous and turbulent natures into a sweet calme of Civill concord. </p>
        <p>A Curtayne flying up, a horrid Sceane appeared of storme and tempest: no glimpse of the Sun was seene, as if darkenesse, confusion, and deformity, had possest the world, and driven light to Heaven, the trees bending, as forced by a gust of winde, their branches rent from their trunkes, and some torne up by the roots: a farre off was a darke wrought sea, with rowling billowes, breaking against the rockes, with rayne, lightning and thunder: in the midst was a globe of the Earth, which at an instant falling on fire, was turned into a Fury, her hayre upright, mixt with snakes, her body leane wrinkled and of a swarthy colour, her breasts hung bagging downe to her waste, to which with a knot of serpents was girt red bases, and under it tawny skirts downe to her feet: in her hand she brandisht a sable Torch, and looking aScanse with hollow envious eyes came downe into the Roome. </p>

        <p>This Antimasque being past, the Sceane changed into a calme, the skie serene, a farre off Zephyrus appeared breathing a gentle gale: in the Landskip were Corne fields and pleasant Trees, sustayning Vines fraught with grapes, and in some of the furthest parts Villages, with all such things as might expresse a Country in peace, rich, and fruitfull. There came breaking out of the Heavens a silver Chariot, in which sate two persons, the one a woman in a watchet garment, her dressing of silver mixt with bulrushes, representing Concord: somewhat below her sate the good Genius of Great Britaine, a yong man in a carnation garment, embroidered all with flowers, an Anticke sword hung in a skarfe, a garland on his head, and in his hand a branch of Platan mixt with eares of corn: these in their dissent sung together. </p>
