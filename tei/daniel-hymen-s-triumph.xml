            <l>Which would be more then all my suffrings were. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>Indeed me thought when I beheld the face </l>

            <l>Confounded all with passion, which did much </l>
            <l>Afflict my hart: but yet I litle thought </l>
            <l>It could haue beene for any others loue. </l>
            <l>I did suppose the memorie of me, </l>
            <l>And of my rapture, had possest him so, </l>
            <l>As made him shew that countenance of woe. </l>
            <pb n="14" xml:id="ep000361-012-a"/>
            <l>And much adoe had I then to forbeare </l>
            <l>From casting me into his armes, and yeild </l>
            <l>What comfort my poore selfe could yeild, but that </l>
            <l>I thought our ioyes would not haue bin complete, </l>

            <l>Which now a little stay (though any stay </l>

          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>And therefore I resolu'd my selfe to beare </l>
            <l>This burthen of our sufferings yet a while, </l>
            <l>And to become a seruant in this guise, </l>
            <l>To her I would haue skorned otherwise: </l>
            <l>And be at all commands, to goe, and come, </l>
            <l>To trudge into the fields, early, and late. </l>
            <l>Which though I know, it misbecomes my state: </l>
            <l>Yet it becomes my fortune, which is that, </l>
            <l>Not Phillis whom I serue: but since I serue, </l>
            <l>I will doe what I doe most faithfully. </l>
          </lg>
          <lg>
            <l>But Thirsis, is it possible that thou </l>
            <l>Shouldst so forget me, and forgo thy vowe; </l>
            <l>Or is it but a flying vaine report, </l>
            <l>That slanders thine affection in this sort? </l>
            <l>It may be so, and God grant it may be so: </l>
            <l>I shall soone finde if thou be false or no: </l>
