        <head>Â¶ To the right worshipfull Sir Owen Hopton Knight, the Queenes Maiesties Lieutenante of hir highnes Tower of London, Ber. Gar. Citizen of London wisheth health and increase of Worship. </head>
        <p>SIthens at my returne from Norwich (Right worshipfull) you vouchsafed to imparte vnto me your earnest desire to vnderstand the order and manner how hir Maiestie was receyued into that worthy Citie: I am bold likewise to decipher vnto your worship what occasion offered themselues to me vpon the same your request. First appeared to me the Maiestie of my Prince, which beautifieth her kingdome, as the bright shining beames of beautiful Phoebus decketh forth the earth: which gladded the hartes of the people there, as they no lesse laboured to trauayle forth to view the excellency of their soueraigne, than the true labouring Bee enforceth hir self in the Spring tyme (when dame Flora first decketh the soile) to seeke their delights, and our profit, amongst the sweete smelling floures. Then the aboundant clemencie of hir highnes, receyuing the loyall hartes of hir louing people in parte, as good as their meaning deserued, so enflamed their former desires, as euery sparke kindled a bonfire. The Nobilitie delighting this Harmony, so endeuoured to hold in tune euery string of this heauenly Musike, as there semed but one hart in Queene, Counsaile, and Communaltie. The Mayor, Magistrates, and good Citizens employed their study and substaunce <pb xml:id="ep000025-003-a"/>to holde on this happy beginning, the Prince had hir pleasure, the Nobilitie their desire, the whole traine such intertainment: As for the tyme of hir continuance there, Norwich seemed (if any such there be) a terrestriall Paradise. But when the frowning Friday folowed, which called hir Maiestie thence, I leaue (because I am loth to tel) the dolour that was, to the report of them that did see it. These all, right Worshipfull, vpon your demaund, presented themselues vnto me to be vttred, and these (I thinke) are the thinges which you desired to heare. And because I doubt not but that there are a great number of your vertuous mynd herein: to satisfie both them and you, I haue here set forth what my final capacitie could collect (touching the premisses) during the whole tyme of hir abode there. Accept my rude and rashe dealing in this my doyng, I beseech you, for that your Worshipfull request carieth me to my vttermost limite: wherein, though the sodaine chop of an vnskilfull Carpenter perhaps disquareth the strong tymber of this beautifull frame: yet let the skilfull eye of your worship and other learned Readers (to whome I submitte me) place the same to the best purpose, and holde my good will as recompence of my fault, and bynde me to them, and you for euer. Vale. </p>

        <head>Â¶ The receyuing of the Queenes Maiestie into hir highnesse Citie of Norwich. </head>
        <p>ON Saturday being the .xvj. of August. 1578. and in the twentith yÃ©ere of the raigne of our most gratious soueraign Lady Elizabeth by the grace of God QuÃ©en of England, France, and Irelande, Defendor of the Faith. &amp;c. The same our moste dread and soueraigne Lady (continuing hir Progresse in Norffolke) immediately after dinner set forward from Brakenashe, where she had dyned with the Ladye Style, bÃ©eyng fiue myles distant from Norwich, towardes the same hir most dutifull Citie: Sir Robert Wood, then Esquire, and nowe Knight, Maior of the same Citie, at one of the Clock the same happy day, sette forwarde to mÃ©ete with hir Maiestie in this order: First there roade before him wel and sÃ©emly mounted, thrÃ©escore of the most comelie yong men of the Citie as Bachelers, apparelled all in blacke Sattyn doublets, blacke Hose, blacke Taffata Hattes and yeallowe Bandes, and their vniuersall liuerie was a Mandylion of purple Taffata, layde about with siluer Lace: and so apparelled, marched forwardes two and two in a ranke. Then one which represented King GVRGVNT, sometime King of Englande, which builded the Castle of Norwich, called Blanch Floure, and layde the foundation of the Citie. He was mounted vppon a braue Courser, and was thus furnished: His body Armed: <pb xml:id="ep000025-004-a"/>his Bases of grÃ©en and white silke: on his head a black veluet Hat, with a plume of white Feathers. There attended vpon him thrÃ©e Henchmen in white and grÃ©ene: one of them did beare his Helmet, the seconde his Tergat, the third his Staffe. After him a noble companye of Gentlemen, and wealthie Citizens in veluet Coates, and other costly furniture, brauely mounted. Then followed the Officers of the Citie euery one in his place. Then Maister Sword bearer, with the Sworde and Hatte of Maintainaunce. Then Maister Maior, and foure and twentye Aldermen, and Maister Recorder, al in Scarlet gownes, wherof, so many as had bin Maiors of the Citie, and were Iustices, did weare their scarlet cloakes. Then followed so many as had bin Sherifs, and were no Aldermen, in violet Gowns, &amp; satten tippets. Then followed diuers other, to kÃ©epe the people from disturbing the array aforesaide. Ths euery thing in due and comely order, they al (except GVRGVNT which stayed hir maiesties comming within a flight shot or two of the city, where the Castle of Blaunche Flowre was in moste beautifull prospect) marched forwardes to a bridge, called Hartforde Bridge, the vttermoste lymit that way, distaunt from the Citie two miles or thereaboutes, to mÃ©ete with hir Maiestie: who, within one houre or little more after their attendaunce, came in such gratious and Princely wife, as rauished the harts of all hir louing subiects, and might haue terrifyed the stoutest heart of any enimy to beholde. Whether the Maiestie of the Prince, whiche is incomparable, or ioy of hir subiectes, which excÃ©eded measure, were the greater, I thinke woulde haue appalled the iudgement of Apollo to define. The acclamations and cries of the people to the Almighty God for the preseruation of hir Maiesty, ratled so loude, as hardly for a great time coulde any thing be hearde: But at laste, as euery thing hath an ende, the noise appeased: &amp; Maister Maior saluted hir highnesse with the Oration following, and yÃ©elded to hir Maiestie there with the sworde of the Citie, and a faire standing cup of siluer and guilt, with a couer, and in the Cup one hundreth pounds in golde. The Oration was in these wordes: </p>

              <p>IF our wishe should be graunted vnto vs by the Almighty, what humaine thing we would chiefly desire: we would account nothing more pretious (most Royall Prince) than that the bright beame of your most chast eye, which doth so chere vs, might penetrate the secret strait corners of our hartes: then surely should you see how great ioyes are dispeised there, and howe the spirite and liuely bloud tickle in our arteries and small veynes, in beholding thee the light of this Realme (as Dauid was of Israell) now at length, after long hope and earnest petitions, to appeare in these coastes. Truely on mine owne part, which by your highnesse authoritie and clemencie (with humble thankes be it spoken) do gouerne this famous Citie, and on the parte of these my brethren and all these people which by your authoritie we rule (speaking as they meane, and as I my selfe doe thinke) this onely with all our hartes and humble praiers we desire, that we may so finde your Maiestie gracious and fauourable vnto vs, as you for your part neuer came to any subiects better welcome than to vs your poore subiectes here. For most manifest token wherof, we present vnto your Maiestie here, these signes <pb xml:id="ep000025-006-b"/>of honour and office, whiche wee receiued of the most mighty Prince Henry the fourth, in the fift yere of his raigne, then to vs granted in the name of Mayor, Aldermen, and Shirifs, where as before tyme out of minde or mention, we were gouerned by Bayliffes (as they terme them) which euer since haue bene both established and encreased with continuall priuiledges of Kinges: And which by your only clemencie (which with immortall thankes we shall neuer cease to declare) we haue now these. xx. yeres enioyed: and together with those signes, this treasure is a pledge of our good wils and habilitie: which all how great or little so euer they be, we poure down at your pleasure, that if we haue neglected any thing in all this course of your most happy raigne, which becommeth most louing, obedient, and well willing subiectes to performe, for the preseruation of your Crown, and aduancement of your highnes, you may then determine of vs and al ours, at your most gracious pleasure. But if we haue (God being our guide) so ordered the gouernance of this citie, that we haue kept the same in safetie to your Maiesties vse, and made the people therein (as much as in vs lieth) first, most studious of Gods glory and true religion, and next of your Maiesties health, honour, and pleasure, then aske we <pb xml:id="ep000025-007-a"/>nothing of you, for that the singular clemencie ingraffed in your highnes, wil easily of it self graunt that which is requisite for vs to obtaine. We only therefore desire, that God would aboundantly blesse your highnesse with al good gifts of minde and body. </p>

The Cup and money was deliuered to a Gentleman, one of hir Maiesties footemen to carry: Maister Maior saide to hir, Sunt hic Centum librae puri auri, the couer of the Cup lifted vp, hir Maiestie saide to the footman, looke to it, there is a hundreth pound. With that hir highnesse, with the whole companye, marched towardes Norwich, till they came to a place called the Towne Close, distant from the Citie a good flightshot, where the partie, which represented Gurgunt, came foorth, as in maner is expressed, and was readye to haue declared to hir Maiestie thys spÃ©ech following: but by reason of a showre of raine whiche came, hir Maiestie hasted away, the spÃ©ech not vttered: But thus it was. </p>

                <head>Â¶ The minister of the Duch Church his Oration in Englishe. </head>
                <p>THE Oratours (most gratious Queene) which liued in the age of them that won greatest renowme; were highly commended, for that they could transforme the Iudges mindes partly, by eloquence, and partly by setting downe before their eyes the calamitie of the thing and person they spake of, into what disposition them listed: the first part declareth vnto vs no common facilitie of men, in that they were so willing in folowing, and attentiue in hearing, as they would suffer themselues to be lead by eloquence: the last, obteined great fauour amongest all nations, whose common weale was gouerned in good order, and far greater amongest the Christians: but greatest of all with thee O most excellent Queene, the nourse of Christ his church, whose minde obedient to Gods worde, the spirite of Christ, and zeale of Godlinesse, and not this profane kinde of speech hath instructed: the verie calamitie of Godly men, and teares of the afflicted, the teares, I say, of faithfull Christians haue throughly moued thee to defende and protect the miserable and dispersed members of Christ obiecte to euerie kinde of iniurie, before beaten in peeces by <pb xml:id="ep000025-014-a"/>a thousand deathes with the safetie and preseruation as well of minde as bodie: for these thy singuler benefits of Godlinesse towards vs, and that wee liue vnder so good a tutor beeing magistrate in this the Citie of Norwich, which thy maiestie hath of elemencie granted vnto vs for a mansion place, which were banished for Christ his religion, &amp; moreouer that we finde the mindes of the people fauourable towards vs, first we geue immortall thanks, not suche as we ought, but such as we are able vnto God the father, and the Lorde our only sauiour Iesus Christ, and then vnto thee most mercifull Queene. Moreouer it is our humble and yet our only petition to shewe vnto your maiestie the thankfulnesse of our minde: behold therfore dedicated to your most excellent maiestie not any gifte but our minde, no princely iewell but a monument of godlinesse and posteritie, the which we hope will be so much the more acceptable to your maiestie, for because the goodnesse of God towardes your maiestie is liuely drawen out of the historie of the innocent &amp; most godly Iosephus, whom neither pollicie, strength nor desire of bearing rule, but constant faith, godlinesse of a Christian heart, and heauenly vertue by Gods singular mercie, deliuered from the bloudie conspiracie of his brethren &amp; feare of death, and brought vnto high dignitie and royal kingdome: to whose brethren that prouerbiall sentence of the Hebrewes is verie fitly alluded. Enuie being the desire of euill things, and couetousnesse of transitorie renowne, is often times the occasion of mans destruction: but touching the minde of Iosephus, the same was endued with suche temperance and fortitude, that he might be thought no lesse vniust then wicked, that would accuse him so much as with the least affection of reuengement: so wholly did he commit him self and all the gouernement of his life, his life, I say, put in hazard in a strange kingdom vnto the prouidence of God, that he seemed to hang of no other thing then the onely will of God. But to what ende speake I this? Are not these selfe same things, and others their like (Ã´ most excellent Queene) by the eyes of all men cleerely beholden in thee, and the order of thy kingdome? What man (I say) hauing his wittes, can deny these thinges to be the most happie ioy, spirituall crowne, and cheefest ornament of Christes churche, and truely of this kingdome the princely beautie and perpetuall renowne? Thou surely doest followe moste hollily, the minde of Iosephus, by the singular goodnes of God, aswell in preseruing thy kingdome, as in amplifying the kingdome of Christe (Ã´ thou most faithfull nourse of the churche of God:) for it is in God onely to destroy this man by prosperitie (as it seemeth vnto man) and aduaunce another by all kindes of aduersitie and humaine daunger: whome he acknowledgeth as the vessels of his mercie: and so by his goodnesse, together with the consolation and strength of his spirite, doth bring them to the happinesse of eternall life, which our petition <pb xml:id="ep000025-014-b"/>that good and mercifull God graunt may be ratified in establishing your maiestie and gouernance of your kingdom with spirituall wisedome and vnderstanding, in preseruing the same for many yeres, and in induing your maiesties subiectes more and more with true knowledge of him, for his sonnes sake our Lorde Iesus Christ. Amen. </p>

          <p>In the inner parte of the same, there was the figure of a serpent, enterfolding it selfe: In the middest whereof did sit a doue with this sentence of Christ, Mat. 10.16. Wise as the Serpent, and meeke as the Doue. </p>
          <p>The Wednesday towards euening, master Church-yard was likewise readie vpon the water with another deuise, when her maiestie was without the gates towardes mount Surrey, but weather hindered it so, as nothing was then done by him. But as shÃ©e returned homeward, within Bishops gate at the Hospitall dore, master Stephan Limbert, master of the Grammer schoole in Norwich stoode readie to render her an Oration: her maiestie drew neare vnto him, and thinking him fearefull, saide graciously vnto him: Bee not afeard. He answered her againe in English: I thanke your maiestie, for your good encouragement: and then with good courage entred into this Oration. </p>

                <head>The Oration of Stephan Limbert, publike Scholemaster, to the most magnificent Prince, Elizabeth of England, Fraunce, and Irelande Queene, &amp;c. before the gates of the Hospitall of Norwiche. </head>
                <p>IT is reported (moste gracious Queene,) that Aegypt is watered with the yearely ouerflowing of Nilus, and Lidia with the golden streame of Pactolus, which thing is thought to bee the cause of the greate fertilitie of these countries: but vpon vs, &amp; farther, ouer all Englande, euen in the vttermost borders many and maine riuers of godlinesse, iustice, humilitie, and other innumerable good things, in comparison of the which, golde is vile &amp; nought worth, do most plentifully gush out, and those not from Tmolus, or other hilles I knowe not which, but from that continuall and moste aboundant welspring of your goodnesse. And that of those infinite goodnesses I may lightly touch one, for that neither place, time, nor my facultie doth permit to speake of many: with what praises shall wee extoll: with what magnificent wordes shall wee expresse that <pb xml:id="ep000025-016-b"/>notable mercie of your highnesse, most renowmed Queene, &amp; vncredible readinesse to releeue the neede of poore men, then the which of many vertues none can be more acceptable vnto God, as Homer writeth, neither any vertue in a mightie Prince more wondered at amongest men. This hospitall of poore men is moste famous, whiche will be a monument of princely vertue and beneficence amongest all posteritie, instituted by the moste mightie King Henry your highnesse father, confirmed with the great seale, by the moste noble King Edward your brother, but by your maiestie whiche deserueth no lesse praise, of late notably encreased and amplified by the landes &amp; possessions of Cringleforde, that you may not nowe worthily reioyce so much in others ornamentes, as your owne vertues. For you are saide for your singular wisedome and learning, to haue studied that diuine lawe of the moste wise Plato, which he left written in the eleuenth booke of lawes. Such your great bountie therefore, so exceeding, and incredible mercie (O most vertuous Prince) in what books shall wee comprehende? with what dueties, or with what voice shall wee testifie the good will of a thankfull minde? For when wee diligently seeke all the moste exquisite and curious meanes of thankes-giuing: wee cannot so much as attaine vnto the greatnesse of this one benefite, by the which we acknowledge our selues bounde &amp; streightly holden to your moste royall maiestie. We shalbe ouercome, euen with this one and singular benefite, so muche the lesse hope haue wee then in any point to counteruaile the huge Sea of the rest of thy benefites which ouerfloweth on euery side aswell publikely and generally ouer all thy Subiectes, as properly and particularly vppon this Citie. We certeinly nowe inhabite, and lead our liues in those most happie Ilands of the which Hesiodus maketh mention, which not only abounde with all manner of graine, woll, cattell, and other aydes of mans life, but much more with the moste precious treasure of true religion and the worde of God, in the which onely the mindes of men haue rest and peace. There be that call Englande another worlde, which I thinke may bee moste true in this our age: For whereas all landes on euery side of vs are afflicted with most greuous warres, &amp; tossed with the floudes of dissention, we onely, your highnesse gouerning our sterne, do saile in a moste peaceable hauen, and seuered from the worlde of mischiefes, do seeme after a sorte to bee taken vp into a heauen of happinesse. We therefore, according to our bounden duetie, first giue thankes vnto God Almightie, vnto whose goodnesse only with thankes wee referre all this our happinesse, howe great soeuer it be, and pray that he woulde vouchesafe to make the same proper and perpetuall vnto vs. And afterwards, vnto your highnesse, (O most gratious Queene) by whose studie, care and diligence wee confesse this blessednes to be gotten, &amp; so many yeares preserued vnto vs. </p>
                <pb xml:id="ep000025-017-a"/>
                <p>We are glad in this beholding you, and we reioyce with desire more than may be beleeued, which as I speake of mine owne thought, so also all these subiectes of Norwich desire me to say the same in their behalfe. And I would to God you coulde pearce these our breasts with your eyes, and throughly viewe the hidden and couered creekes of our mindes: then vndoubtedly shoulde you beholde an infinite heape of good will closely shutt vpp within, which cannot breake out of so narrowe straights. All the faith, studie, and obedience, which are due to so greate a Prince, as hitherto we haue most willingly imployed, so will we alwayes most diligently perfourme the same: and if at any time anie chaunce shall happen (which fortune God turne from vs) that the state of thy blessed maiestie or of this florishing realme shoulde come in daunger, or the worthinesse thereof be in hazarde, we doe not onely protest the effusion of all our goods and substaunce, but also the putting foorth and brunt of our strengthes and bodies therein. Finally we desire and beseech thy excellencie (most renowmed Queene) well to accepte of this our duetie, howe soeuer it be, proceeding from a singular good will, and a moste thankfull minde, and so to think of vs Citizens of Norwich, that perhaps you haue many times com to people more wealthie, but to more ioyfull neuer. </p>

          <p>This finished, hir Maiestie in Princely manner marched towardes the confines of the liberties of the Citie of Norwich, whiche I suppose almost twoo miles: before she came there, Maister Maior brake to my Lorde Chamberlaine, that he was to vtter to hir Maiestie an other Oration, wherof my Lord sÃ©emed to haue good liking: but before they came to the saide confines, <pb xml:id="ep000025-021-b"/>Maister Maior was willed to forbeare the vtteraunce of the same his Oration, bicause it was about vij. of the clock, and hir Maiestie had then fyue myles to ride. Neuerthelesse he gaue to hir Maiestie both his Orations in writing, whiche she thanked him for. She also thanked the Maior, euery Alderman, and the Commoners, not onely for the great cheare they hadde made hir, but also for the open housholds they kept to hir highnesse seruaunts, and al other. Then she called Maister Maior &amp; made him Knight: &amp; so departing, sayd: I haue laid vp in my breast such good wil, as I shall neuer forget Norwich, and procÃ©eding onward did shake hir riding rod and said: Farewel Norwich, wyth the water standing in hir eies: In which great good wil towards vs all, I besÃ©ech God to continue hir Maiestie with long and triumphant raigne ouer vs all.

        <head>The Mayors last Oration Englished. </head>
        <p>THose thinges which at their comming are ioyfull, when they depart are the more sorowful. For what (Ã´ mighty God) could this Sunne at any tyme behold more happy, than we did seeme to our selues, either when first (Ã´ most merciful Prince) the brightnesse of thy Maiestie did here shine out, or els in all the tyme we rested in your presence, as in a paradise or most happy abundance of all thinges. But woe to that chaungeable course of humaine thinges, which suffreth nothing vncorrupt, nor any thing eternall: so pleasure bringeth after it sadnesse, and griefe doth not onely sÃ²dainly take away our delightes, but most bitterly cut of the same. So that we that lately receyued thee approching with all ioyes: should follow thee departing (if the renowne of your highnesse and trayne would suffer it) with mourning garments. If you demaund the cause of so great sorow, I know not what part of his Maiestie God hath indued your person withall, which doth stirre vp great reuerence of thee, but full of a certaine wonderfull loue, wherby it comes to passe that we hardely suffer our selues to be seuered from your presence. Adde moreouer, that we seeme after a sort vnto your highnesse (such is your clemencie) to haue satisfied euery pointe of gratefulnes: yet haue we not, nor euer shall we satisfie our selues in that behalfe. We would wishe a longer vse of tyme (if it were profitable) that we might expresse, if not a greater, yet a more continuall shew of our loue and obedience. But we must both yelde to your pleasure, and to the common wealth, for that we know assuredly to our great and singular aduauncement, you neuer cease to seeke out and afoord the same to all your subiectes. Go now therefore, go with luckie steppe thether, whether thy vertue calleth thee. And for vs, this shall comfort vs aboundantly (which deserueth both immortall thankes and perpetuall memory) that thou so renowmed a Prince, hast vouchsafed so curteously to visite our dwellinges. And finally, we here before thee, whom God hath annointed, and before all this famous assembly, take God (which now beholdeth vs) to our witnesse, that we will keepe our faith and obedience in him to thee onely for euer. Thou Nurce of religion, Mother of the Common Wealth, Beautie of Princes, Solace of thy Subiectes, most happily (oh how I rue to speake it) Farewell. </p>

        <head>Oratio St. Limberti quae discessura Principe recitata fuisset, nisi quod sero iter ingressa est. </head>
        <p>SCribit Gellius in noctibus Atticis, Eminentissima Princeps, Phauorinum Philosophum dixisse, nunc matrem esse diem, nunc esse neuer cam, &amp; hunc versum longo hominum aeuo probatum sermonibus suis vsurpasse, <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>. Quem ipse Gellius ita interpretatur, dolorum ac voluptatum esse vicissitudines, non omni dic bene esse posse, sed isto bene, atque alio malÃ¨. Nihil autem nec venustius vnquam nec verius dictum fuisse, tum perpetua rerum humanarum volubilit as, &amp; crebrae mutationes indicant, tum hodiernus dies fidem facit amplissimam. Non enim tam recreauit nos Ã¨ diuturno me rore atque desyderio laetissimus ille aduentus celsitudinis tuae, quÃ m isto quem vndiqueiam parari videmus discessu exanimamur, vtque omnium aetatum atque ordinum infiniti plausus &amp; gratulationes venientem exceperunt: ita nemo est qui non discedentem etiam luctu &amp; lachrymis prosequatur. Equidem vt de me ipso loquar, quoniam meus mihi notissimus est animus, nunquam me duriorem prouinciam sustinuisse profiteor, quÃ m est haec imposita mihi hoc tempore, non solum vt affarar cruditissimam principem, quod tamen per se arduum est &amp; difficile, sed multo magis vt hoc tristi &amp; acerbo valedicendi munere defungerer. Quis enim non vehementer indolueris breuissimo tempore ac veluti <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman} </seg>vidisse se quod maxime concupierat, ereptum ante quam eo penitus perfrui liceret? Quam luctuosum est, lactentes infantulos ab vberibus matrum &amp; charissimis amplexibus diuelli? A patribus filios quibus vnicÃ¨ diliguntur grauiori aliquo casu separari? Nullis tamen mortalibus arbitror naturam tantos amores tantam beneuolentiam, aut in cos quos procrearunt ingenerasse, aut Turrian quibus sunt procreati, quanta est ea qua nos omnes celsitudinem tuam communem, videlicet parentem patriae, suspicimus, colimus, veneramur. Magna vis est amicitiae &amp; necessitudinis, quae saepe facit, vt qui vel societate aliqua, vitaeque consuetudine aliquandiu coniuncti fuerint, ita cohaereant animis &amp; quasi coalescant: vt a se inuicem distrahi atque disiungi molestissime serant. Hinc Theseasides omnium ore ac literis celebrata, aliorumque innumerabilium arctissima necessitudo, quos nulla peris cula, nulli terra marique labores, ab eorum quibus conuixissent suauissimo <pb xml:id="ep000025-023-a"/>Comitatu depellere potuerunt. Quae autem tanta studia, tanti ardores animorum vsquam reperti sunt, qui nostris erga te praestantissima Princeps synceris minimeque fucatis voluntatibus conferantur? Non satis ostendunt ista fidem &amp; beneuolentiam nostram, maior est quÃ m vel cuiusquam eruditissimi copia, nedum huius ingenij mei mediocritate possit illustrari. Nullas vnquam res arctiori nexu &amp; maiori concordia, quÃ m animum &amp; corpus natura colligauit, quod &amp; in vita declarat incredibilis illorum conspiratio, sibique mutuo subueniendi cura, &amp; in morte grauissima distractio. Nos autem qui Christianam religionem ac pietate profitemur, multo magis quÃ m illi Decij, Scaeuolae, Curtij, qui se pro Repub. Romana denouisse dicuntur, &amp; patriam, &amp; cam qua patriae salus continetur etiam vita nostra chariorem habere didicimus. Quis enim est qui pro ea dubitet mortem oppetere, quae si non esset, grauiorem morte seruitutem perpeti cogeretur? Neque verÃ² est haec pietas tuorum animis leuiter infixa, &amp; quasi summo fundata solo, Illustrissima Regina, sed altis nixa radicibus qua nullis fortunae procellis ac tempestatibus concuti, nullis subuerti machinis, nullo impetu expugnari potest. Quantum enim facit ad amoris &amp; fidei stabilitatem, quod sciamus celsitudinem tuam non arbitrio vacillantis fortunae, sediure haereditario, hoc est <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman} </seg>dominationem &amp; imperium obtinuisse, nec Homericum tibi Iouem <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, sed verum illum rerum omnium opificem &amp; fabricatorem in manus tradidisse? ac propterea summam esse nobis parendi necessitatem etiam diuinitus impositam, ne Gyganteo more <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, vt est in fabulis, ipsique Deo sceleratissimÃ¨ bellum indicere videamur. Quid cÃ¹m perspiciamus quantis quamque diuinis rempub meritis affecerit celsitudo tua vtiam ex innumerabilibus terris ac gentibus quae soli subiectae sunt, nulla, non dicam, anteferrinobis, sed ne comparari quidem possit. Non ad illam parendi legem &amp; necessitatem summam etiam oporter voluntatem accedere? Quid enim referam vigintiiam totos annos in tanta nos pace, tanta tranquillirate vixisse, quantam non solum haec aetas nunquam vidit, sed ne omnium quidem seculorum ac gentium annales vetustatisque monumenta memoriae prodiderunt? Quid commemorem longÃ¨ velut Ã¨ specula prospectas tempestates, praeuisa simul &amp; anticipata censilio grauissima pericula, clandestinas insidias non tam vi quÃ m arte obrutas, omnes denique nefarios conatus maximo cum applausis extinctos, nullo aut sane perexiguo motum populari? Facerent ista quidem vt qualiscunque <pb xml:id="ep000025-023-b"/>esses, omnem tamen fidem &amp; beneuolentiam maiestati tuae libentissimis animis praestaremus. I am vero cÃ¹m mitissimam te &amp; clementissimam principem habeamus, quae in summa potestate constituta ne tantillum quidem ab aequitate modoque recedis, quis est tam ferus ac ferreus, quem non ad omnem obseruantiam tantae virtutis inuitarent? Quare si firmissima sit custodia principum fides, subditorum, quemadmodum prudentissimos sensisse viros accepimus, quid potest tutius esse &amp; securius excellentia tua, quÃ m tanta tuorum studia muniuerunt? Extraxi longius orationem meam, Nobilissima Regina, vt paulo diutius frueremur vsurae incundissimi conspectus tui, quem non fine maxima molestia grauissimoque dolore amissuri sumus. Sed quia ferenda sors est quae vitari non potest, ne profectionem tuam plus aequo remorari videar dum obsequi studeo cupiditati nostrae, finem dicendifaciaÌ. Tuam vero Maiestatem quam ex oculis nostris hodiernus dies eripiet animis tamen &amp; voluntatibus prosequemur, absentem semper intuebimur, legibus &amp; mandatis studiosissime obtemperabimus, salutem denique &amp; incolumitatem tuam quae nostra etiam salus continetur, Deo Opt. Max. assiduis precibus quÃ m diutissimÃ¨ tuendam &amp; conseruandam commendabimus. </p>

        <head>Mr Limberts Oration, which had bin rehearsed at hir Graces departing, but that she set late forward in hir Progresse. </head>
        <p>GEllius in his Noctibus Atticis (moste excellente Princesse) doth write, that it was the saying of Phaeuorinus the Philosopher, that the daye was one while a mother, another while a stepdame: and that hee vsed this verse, long time allowed, among men, in hys accustomed communication, <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>. Which verse Gellius in this manner expoundeth: That of sorrows &amp; pleasures there be changes, that it cannot be well euery daye with vs, but this day well, and that day yl. And surely, that nothing hath bin at any time more gallauntly or truely spoken, both the continuall course of mans vncertaine estate, and the often alterations wherto he is subiect, manifestly declare, beside that, this present day giueth euident proofe thereof. For, the most ioyfull comming of your highnesse, did not so muche recreate and comforte vs in our daylye desire and longing, as we are discouraged by this your departing, whereto we see preparation made on al hands. And as all ages and degrees receyued your Maiestie, with ioy and gladnes at your comming: so there is not one but lamenteth and mourneth at your graces going. And doubtlesse for my part, bycause myne owne hart is best knowne to my selfe, I protest that I neuer tooke vppon me a greater charge, then that, wherewyth at this present I am burthened: not onely to speake face to face with a most learned lady and princesse, which notwithstanding is, of it self, a harde and a busie matter: but, which is much more, that to me is befallen the sad and sorowful office of leaue taking. For, who woulde not be exceedingly greeued, to see the thing which he principallye desired, in a verye shorte time, and as it were <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, at an instant taken away, before he might haue therof full fruition? How lamentable a thing is it, to pul away sucking babes from the breastes and bosomes of their most louing <pb xml:id="ep000025-024-b"/>mothers? That sonnes and fathers, through some miserable misfortune, shoulde be sundered? Yet I notwithstanding am of opinion, that nature hath not ingendered in any man, such large loue, and so great good will, no not towarde them whom they haue begotten, or of whom they themselues haue bene begotten, as is the loue and good will wherewith we aduaunce, obey, and reuerence your Maiestie, being the mother and nurse of this whole Common welth, and Countrie. Great is the force of friendshippe and familiaritie, which oftentimes bringeth to passe, that they, which eyther by some kinde of fellowshippe, or by an accustomed condition of life, in tracte of time haue bin closely knitte, and so become both of one minde, and as it were growne togither, that hard and scant they may be seperated, &amp; set in sunder. Hereof sprang the faithfulnesse of Theseus, commended by the mouth and monumentes of all men: and the entier friendshippe of innumerable more, whom no daungers, nor labours, eyther by sea or land, coulde sequester from their sweete society &amp; comfortable company, with whom they long had liued. And what desires, or what delightes haue any where bin founde, that may be compared with the sincere affection, and vnfayned good wil, which we beare to your Highnesse, moste excellent Princesse? These are not sufficiente shewes of our fayth and beneuolence, which is much greater, than that the eloquence of any learned man, or that the slendernesse of my witte and capacitie maye make it manifest. Nature at no tyme tyed any thyng with a straighter knotte, or set seueral things at greater agreement, than the soule and the bodie: a declaration wherof is, the incredible consent and concorde of them both, the mutual care and regard of succouring each other resting in them both: and the grieuous departing, at the houre of death, the one from the other remayning in them both. But we whiche professe Christian religion and godlynesse, haue learned this lesson, not only to loue our countrye, but also hir highnesse, in whom the health and safetie of our countrey consisteth, farre aboue the valiaunt Decij, the Scaeuolae the Curtij, which ventured their liues for the Common wealth of Rome: yea, to loue hir grace much <pb xml:id="ep000025-025-a"/>better than our owne liues. For, what is he that woulde doubt to dye for hir sake, who if she were not, he should be constreyned to abide a bondage much more bitter than death? Neyther is this faithfull loue of vs your subiectes (most excellente Queene) lightly layde vp in our heartes, and scarcely couered as it were in the ground, but deepely rooted, so that by no stormes nor tempestes of Fortune it can be shaken, by no engines ouerthrowen, by no force or violence vndertroden. For how muche maketh it for the establishmente of faith and loue, in that we know your Maiestie hath obteyned regimente and rule, not at the pleasure and appoyntmente of wauering Fortune, but by right of inheritance, that is to say, <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>: nor that the Homericall Iuppiter <seg xml:lang="unk">{non-Roman} {non-Roman} {non-Roman}</seg>, but that the maker and Creator of all things delyuered it into your Highnesse handes? And therefore a singular necessitie of obedience is layde vpon vs, euen by God himselfe, least in Giant guise as it is feygned, we set shoulder against God, and being at defiance with him most wickedly, bidde him battell. When we beholde those excellent and diuine benefites, whiche youre grace hathe bestowed vpon the common wealthe, in so much that among manye, yea innumerable Countreys, and nations vnder the Sunne, none (I will not saye maye bee preferred before vs) but not so much as one may be compared with vs. Ought not then a singulare loue and good will to be lincked with that lawe, and necessitie of obedience? For what should I make rehearsall of full twenty yeares, wherein we haue liued in such peace and tranquilitie, as not only this our age hath neuer seene the like, but as in olde recordes and aunciente Chronicles of all ages and people, is no where mentioned? What shoulde I call to memorie hurlyburlies foreseene a farre off, as from an espyall: exceeding great daungers, not only perceyued by wisedome, but also preuented by counsell: secrete snares, and priuie practises disappoynted, not to muche by violence, as by policie: finally, all Treacherous attemptes, and Rebellious enterprises, with great gladnesse and reioicing extinguished, without any tumult at all, or very little (doÃºbtlesse) insuing among <pb xml:id="ep000025-025-b"/>the people? These things might make vs (although your Grace were otherwise than you are) performe all dutie of fayth and loue, with most willing mindes to your Maiestie. Nowe, for so muche as we haue your highnesse, our mercifull and bountifull Soueraigne, who possessing principalitie and royall regimente, doest not swarue an heares breadth from iustice and equitie, what is he for a man so sauage and obstinate, whome these so singulare and rare vertues may not allure to all loue and allegiance? Wherefore, if the surest safetie of Princes is the faith of their subiectes (as we haue heard very wise men holde opinion) what can be more safe, what can be more sure, than your excellencie, which the studies and endeauoures of your people, being so great, haue fenced and fortifyed? I haue made mine Oration the longer (most noble Queene) to the intent we might the longer enioy your comfortable presence, from the whiche, to oure great griefe and sorow, we shall depart. But bycause lucke must be borne, which can not be auoyded, least I might seeme more than is meete to delay youre Graces progresse, whiles I am in hand to please mine owne humour, I will make an ende. Concerning your Maiestie, whose presence this day will shutte from our sight, we will notwithstanding in your absence behold and reuerence, we will loue youre Highnesse with all oure heartes, mindes, and endeauoures: we will most dutyfully obey youre Graces Lawes and Commaundementes. Finally, your Maiesties good estate (wherevpon likewise our safetie dependeth) we will commende to Almightie God in oure dayly Prayers, that the same a long tyme may bee continued, and also preserued. Amen. </p>

        <l>IN shadowing cloudes why art thou closd? Ã² Phoebus bright retire: </l>
        <l>Vnspoused Pallas present is, Ã´ Phoebus bright retire. </l>
        <l>The threatning speare is floong farre off, doubt not grim Gorgons ire: </l>
        <l>Vnarmed Pallas present is, Ã´ Phoebus bright retire. </l>
        <l>Perhaps thou art afrayd: And why? at this so large a light: </l>
        <l>Least that a Woman should excell, thy beames (Ã´ Phoebus) bright. </l>
        <l>Let not a Queene, a Virgine pure, which is, and euer was, </l>
        <l>O faire Apollo, make thee blush: you both in beautie passe. </l>
        <l>O Phoebus safe and sound returne, which, banishing the night, </l>
        <l>Bringst backe the day: in all the world nothing of like delight. </l>
        <l>She, only she, the darkenesse draue of Poprye quite away: </l>
        <l>And, by Religion, hath restord the bright and lightsome day. </l>
        <l>O Phoebus, with thy beames, which foylst the cloudes both blinde and blacke, </l>
        <l>The world, in manner all, a thing of like delight doth lacke. </l>
        <l>A thousand daungers and delayes, the Papistes had deuisde, </l>
        <l>To thende our Princesse should abridge, hir progresse entreprisde: </l>
        <l>Yet this our bright and shining sunne, cast light through euery cloud: </l>
        <l>Although in cloudes thou art content, Apollo, oft to shroude. </l>
        <l>Thou seest our Sunne in comely course, cuttes off eache stop &amp; stay: </l>
        <l>Do thou the like, and by thy light driue euery cloude away. </l>
        <l>In shadowing cloudes why art thou closd? Ã´ Phoebus bright retyre: </l>
        <l>Vnspoused Pallas present is: Ã´ Phoebus bright retyre. </l>
