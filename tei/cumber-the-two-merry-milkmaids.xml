        <p>EVery Writer must gouerne his Penne according to the Capacitie of the Stage he writes too, both in the Actor and the Auditor. This had the happinesse to please, as it was means, the greater part, and of them not the worst. If there be discouerie made of the Coniuring Words, you'le find the Witchcraft: no true Spirit will be stir'd with 'hem; haply, a malicious. It was made more for the Eye, then the Eare; lesse for the Hand, then eyther: and had not false Copies trauail'd abroad (euen to surbating) this had kept in; for so farre the Author was from seeking fame in the publishing, that hee could haue wisht it bound about with the King. Some good words here you shall finde for your Money, else it keepes not touch with the Title. Receiue it well, and though in this he giue you no ill, yet hereafter he hath promis'd you better Language. </p>
