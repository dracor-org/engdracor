     TO THE READER.
    </head>
    <p>
     AS this triffle of a Comedy, was only a slight piece of Scribble, purely design'd for the Introduction of a little Musick, being no more than a short weeks work, to serve the wants of a thin Playhouse, and Long Vacation; under those little circumstances it needs no Apology for either the Plot or the Writing part of it: It neither sets up for a Play, nor the Author for a Poet: Such as it is, it has served a present Exigence, and so gain'd the Point. I have no Appeal therefore to the Mercy either of the Auditors, or the Reader. 'Tis true, I thrust it into the World; for 'tis the fashion to be in Print. A Play that sees not three Days, however shall meet with some kind Bookseller, that in spight of the Paper Tax, shall take the naked thing into Mercy, and this hasty Brat is however a little longer liv'd, had the Honour of keeping the Stage for five Days Reign, and is not yet under the Fear of Abdication.
    </p>
    <p>
     Yet as indifferent as I am to the merit of the Comedy (and my Reader I suppose as indifferent) it has one Capital Argument lyes against it; for I stand impeacht (at least the Publick Cry is loud upon that Subject) that I have stolen a Character from a Comedy of Mrs. P&#8212; t' s, being the Humour of Bondi the pretended blind Man.&#8212; I would not willingly be thought so poor a Plagiary, and am far from being guilty of this accusation. For, in the first place, I had that hint from a Novel, and that Play of her's that has such a Character I declare I never Read. 'Tis true, such a one she brought into the House, and made me a Solicitor to the Company to get it Acted, which when I had obtain'd, she very mannerly carry'd the Play to the other House; and had I really taken the Character from her, I had done her no more than a piece of Justice.

    <l>
     TO this poor Treat, these Honour'd Guests t'invite,
    </l>
    <l>
     I come my own Embassador to Night,
    </l>
    <l>
     To tell the truth, your Bill of Fare is small,
    </l>
    <l>
     It is a little Humble Comedy, that's all:
    </l>
    <l>
     For standard Sense, mine is too course Allay,
    </l>
    <l>
     Alas, that Talent does not lie my way:
    </l>
    <l>
     But though this Play in Wit be not so strong,
    </l>
    <l>
     'Thas that will do as well, it trouls along,
    </l>
    <l>
     With a whole train of Fiddles, Dance and Song.
    </l>
    <l>
     And tho to other heights, my Pen can't rise,
    </l>
    <l>
     What the Dish wants, the Garnature supplies;
    </l>
    <l>
     Then Gentlemen be kind for once at least,
    </l>
    <l>
     And take the running Banquet for a Feast:
    </l>
    <l>
     Besides, ill nature now's quite out of door,
    </l>
    <l>
     The Bloody Flag shou'd now hang out no more:
    </l>
    <l>
     Criticks, their whole Hostilities shou'd cease,
    </l>
    <l>
     'Twere hard to exclude the Stage out of the Peace:
    </l>
    <l>
     But if your spight will needs my Fate decree,
    </l>
    <l>
     And my poor Comedy and I, both damn'd must be,
    </l>
    <l>
     I shall not Cheat the Devil, he'll cheat me.

     EPILOGUE, Spoke by Mr. Mills, ascending from under the Stage.
    </head>
    <l>
     THis Scribbling Fop has given me no small trouble
    </l>
    <l>
     To think how he has made the Devil a bubble,
    </l>
    <l>
     To be thus Cheated is some pain, tis true,
    </l>
    <l>
     But I'm afraid, to give the Devil his due,
    </l>
    <l>
     He end his Devil both has cheated you.
    </l>
    <l>
     Ay, That's all Hell indeed&#8212; for if you are shamm'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     We're e'en in a fair way of being damn'd,
    </l>
    <l>
     But ben't so cruel, for this once for bear
    </l>
    <l>
     Your Damning hands and a poor sinner spare;
    </l>
    <l>
     Besides, consider, for some small excuse
    </l>
    <l>
     To this poor-Off-spring of his starvling Muse,
    </l>
    <l>
     It wanted Wine and Wit, for Inspiration,
    </l>
    <l>
     Being the Lean Brat of a poor long Vacation;
    </l>
    <l>
     Let him, for my sake, some small Mercy find,
    </l>
    <l>
     Yes, Critick's, my dear Brothers, pray be kind,
    </l>
    <l>
     Strain a small point of courtesie; ay do,
    </l>
    <l>
     And in my turn I'll be as kind to you,
    </l>
    <l>
     You'll find the old black Gentleman so Civil
    </l>
    <l>
     You'll fear no Sprights, but the white charming Devil.
