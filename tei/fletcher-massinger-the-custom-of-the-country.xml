          <head>Another Prologue for the Custome of the Countrey. For my Sonne Clarke. </head>
          <l>WEe wish, if it were possible, you knew </l>
          <l>What we would give for this nights looke, if new? </l>
          <l>It being our ambition to delight </l>
          <l>Our kinde spectators with what's good, and right. </l>
          <l>Yet so farre know, and credite me, 'twas made </l>
          <l>By such, as were held work-men in their Trade, </l>
          <l>At a time too, when they as I divine, </l>
          <l>Were truly merrie, and dranke lusty wine. </l>
          <l>The nectar of the Muses; Some are here </l>
          <l>I dare presume, to whom it did appeare. </l>
          <l>A well-drawne piece, which gave a lawfull birth </l>
          <l>To passionate Scoenes mixt with no vulgar mirth. </l>
          <l>But unto such to whom 'tis knowne by fame </l>
          <l>From others, perhaps only by the name. </l>
          <l>I am a suitor, that they would prepare </l>
          <l>Sound palats, and then judge their bill of fare. </l>
          <l>It were injustice to decry this now </l>
          <l>For being like'd before, you may allow </l>
          <l>(Your candor safe) what's taught in the olde schooles, </l>
          <l>All such as liv'd before you, were not fooles. </l>

          <head>The Epilogue. </head>
          <l>I Spake much in the Prologue for the Play, </l>
          <l>To its desert I hope, yet you might say </l>
          <l>Should I change now from that, which then was meant, </l>
          <l>Or in a syllable grow lesse confident. </l>
          <l>I were weake-hearted. I am still the same </l>
          <l>In my opinion, and forbeare to frame </l>
          <l>Qualification, or excuse: If you </l>
          <l>Concur with me, and hold my judgement true. </l>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
