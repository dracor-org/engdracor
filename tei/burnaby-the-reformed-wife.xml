        <head>TO THE Right Honourable JOHN LORD LORN. </head>
        <p>I Impute it to my good Fortune, My Lord, that the first appearance of this Play was on a Wednesday in Lent; for then (it seems) the Town look for a bad Entertainment, and if they met with any thing they did not expect; it was a disappointment that, I presume; they'll forgive. </p>
        <p>I confess it has succeeded beyond my Expectation, since I understand that Your Lordship also has been pleased to speak in it's Favour. But You did not apprehend what You drew upon Your Self when you was doing so, and little thought, from commending the Brat, to have it laid at Your Door. </p>
        <p>But tho' your approbation in Publick makes me proud, yet the delicacy of your Judgment in private keeps me humble; your Understanding discovers all faults, but your good breeding will not let you take Notice of any, and you can discourage no body, but when they attempt to imitate you. </p>
        <p>If I had oftener had the honour to have been near your Lordship; the Conversation of the Comedy wou'd have discover'd it; and tho' it be my misfortune to be <pb xml:id="ep000470-003-a"/>almost a stranger to your Person. Yet I may safely affirm, that I am throughly acquainted with your Character, and to speak but truth of you, wou'd look too like a Dedication. </p>
        <p>I might inlarge upon the Antiquity of your Race, were I so vain, as to hope to add any thing to the honour of what's recorded in our Annals; I might dwell upon those Qualifications, that render you so amiable to all that know you, the Unaffected sincerity of your Nature, your Zeal for the welfare of your Country; your exemplary Bravery, and just Sence of true Honour; but to do this, my Lord, wou'd be to entertain you with the daily Discourse of your Friends; as for Enemies, you have none but those you found in Flanders, where you were giving Commands to a Regiment, at an Age that others are receiving Precepts from a Tutor. </p>
        <p>I dare say no more, tho' at the same time I disoblige one, I gratifie a thousand; for you are the only Person that can't bear to hear the Lord Lorn well spoke of: But since I would not purchase their approbation at the rate of your displeasure, I must relieve your Lordship from the pain of hearing what's your due, and only tell you that I am, </p>

          <signed>Your Lordship's Most Devoted Humble Servant. </signed>

        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>I don't know whether I have more reason to be pleas'd or griev'd at the Fate of this Play; for the World is very jealous of applause, and he is sure to make a great many Enemies, that is so unfortunate to succeed. </p>
        <p>Some have already done me the Honour to say, that it was not all Mine; tho' I am surpriz'd at the imputation, that what I once believed too great a Dowdy to belong to ev'n my self; should deserve to be thought another's! But the uneasy Criticks, upon a nearer view of its Features, have mortify'd me, and more judiciously concluded, that no Body wou'd own it but my self. </p>
        <p>All that I shall say to these last is, that I did not design a just Play, and that I am as well pleas'd as they are, that I had no regard to the Vnities of Action, &amp;c. but if I diverted my Friends, without offending the Ladies, I have my wish. </p>
        <p>These angry Gentlemen, I presume, will thank me for one thing, in the Third Act, and that is, I have put a Pun in the Mouth of the fine Lady; a Gentleman very remarkable for his good Nature and good Sence; told me of it before it was Acted, but he agreed with me, to allow the Folly, for the sake of the Diversion; it succeeded as we guest, and was always Clap'd. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000470-004-a"/>
        <p>I confess I have had some grave Thoughts on the Occasion of such Labours, and methinks 'tis very strange, that the chief thing, that flatters the vanity of most Writers, is, what they can't know, for Fame is a good that never arrives to us till we are past injoying it, and we are only immortal when we are no more; as for my self, I presume, it will appear by what I have done, that I as little value, as deserve, that Honour, notwithstanding I don't doubt, but I shall be yet believ'd to have my share of the vanity; and that 'twill always be one reason of writing, to be thought a little wiser than we are <q>

        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>SInce Novelties your Palates still pursue, </l>
        <l>You have to Night, both Play and Poet new: </l>
        <l>From whence alone his hopes of pleasing grew. </l>
        <l>For so much this prevailing Passion thrives, </l>
        <l>Each for his future Appetite contrives, </l>
        <l>New Friends, new Favourites, and of late— new Wives. </l>
        <l>You Criticks only keep your Old disease, </l>
        <l>When Authors please you least, you're most at ease. </l>
        <l>Our Poet's therefore glad of a pretence, </l>
        <l>To be insipid, in his own defence, </l>
        <l>And if you hiss, 'tis still at your Expence. </l>
        <l>Often for change the meanest things are good, </l>
        <l>Thus tho' the Town all delicates afford, </l>
        <l>A Kit-cat is a Supper for a Lord. </l>
        <l>But if your Nicer tast resolves to Day, </l>
        <l>To have no relish for our Author's Play. </l>
        <l>Place some diverting Scene before your Mind, </l>
        <l>And think of that, to which you will be kind. </l>
        <l>So thus when heavily the moments pass, </l>
        <l>Toaster's to Circulate the lazy Glass </l>
        <l>By nameing some bright Nymph their draughts refine, </l>
        <l>And tast at once the joys of Love and Wine. </l>

          <p>Here then, Ladies, I must needs lament that we are in some respects not unlike the Crowd; And that it is still a Custom among us to go upon our own Legs. I have often admir'd the Chinese Nobility; who, to prevent the Infamy of so Vulgar an Exercise, contract the Feet of their Infant-Quality, and keep 'em so little, that when they are of Age they may not use 'em; and never cut their Nails that they might not be suspected to work with a Needle— Is it not a Scandal to the Nobles of England, to let a Barbarian transcend 'em in so high a point of Elegance? </p>

          <p>Well Clarinda, I wish you perfect Joy and must own to you, that your life is the Happiest— there all is Quiet, all is Peace, there is nothing to steal the Colour from your Cheeks, or betray you to Surprizes, and now I am convinc'd of the Folly, the Confusion and the Adversity of Mine. </p>

        <l>LET none hereafter Plays Vngodly call, </l>
        <l>For this was writ to mortifie you all. </l>
        <l>No Parson's here expos'd, no Brothel storm'd, </l>
        <l>But a kind handsome keeping <hi>Wife Reform'd</hi>. </l>
        <l>A sign the Youth the World n'er understood, </l>
        <l>Or else he would not dare to be so good. </l>
        <l>He must the Fame he aims at quite disown, </l>
        <l>Who draws good Characters to spoil his own. </l>
        <l>This to excuse I thought a Friend he'd need, </l>
        <l>And came— sick as I am, his Cause to plead: </l>
        <l>'Tis the first Visit I protest I've made. </l>

        <l>Pity the Youth, for my sake I implore you, </l>
        <l>Hissing to Death my tender Organ Wounds! </l>
        <l>And a sick Ear abhors ungrateful Sounds: </l>
        <l>Yet can Applause though ne'er so loud give Ease, </l>
        <l>For they who flatter Women always please. </l>
        <l>Then vain Assistance will I now explore </l>
        <l>In Physick and Astrology no more. </l>
        <l>You, dear Physicians, must my Health insure, </l>
        <l>And t'other Visit will confirm my Cure; </l>
        <l>Else what's already done— is all in vain, </l>
        <l>And I relapse— till you come here again. </l>
        <l>By you I shall be always to be seen, </l>
        <l>For whate'er ails the <hi>sickly Fair </hi>within, </l>
