     TO THE READER.

    <p>
     AFter so many Years treading the Stage, where both in my acting and capering Days (to my Vanity be it spoken) I made no inconsiderable Figure; I come at last to visit the Publick in another of my no less known Capacities, viz. Poetry; and accordingly have turn'd this little Off-sping, this natural Brat of mine, out into the wide World. I confess, indeed, my Talent this way never made any larger Appearance before, than a Prologue, a Lampoon, a Sonnet or Madrigal, or some such shorter Poetical Fragment; and when I launch out into so Voluminous a Piece, as a whole Play, you may believe that my leisure for so tedious a
     <pb xml:id="ep000581-003-a"/>
     scrible, proceeds from no common Cause. A dull Worlds, want of Business, and much Idleness, with not overstockt a Pocket, you see, Gentlemen, may do much. But now, after exposing (to use Ben Johnson's Title) my Works in Print, what success I am like to meet, now hang me, as great a Fortune-Teiler as I have been, all my Prognosticks can no more foretell, than Lily (with Reverence be it spoken) could divine who shit at his Door. My Fate lies in your Hands, and so e'en much good may't do the bold Adventurer, the Bookseller. If it finds your favourable Reception, he has his Point, and I my Wish.
    </p>
    <p>
     But perhaps some over-curious Querists now may ask me, with what Confidence, in the Devil's Name, I durst write a Play. Confidence, say they! I suppose they don't know me that ask that Question: However to satisfie any such inquisitive Gentlemen, in troth I have Acted Mr. Bays so often, and so feel ngly, that I could not possibly for-bear
     <pb xml:id="ep000581-003-b"/>
     copying after so fair an Original. And now if my other Brothers of the Quill picque at me for it, I do not much matter: but if I incur your hard Censure, trust me, Gentlemen, I set so high a Value upon your Favours, that I protest if my Play displease you, and you shall think fit to exclude me from the Muses, as the Players have done from the Stage, it will certainly put me to the charge of a new Recantation to recover your good Graces.
    </p>
    <p>
     Well, but if I must write a Play, How comes it that I begin my Dramatick Writing no sooner? And make my first Essay at these elderly Years upon my Back, this
     <hi>
      Fumbling Age of Poetry
     </hi>
     (as a Reverend elder Brother has it?) Why truly, as old Dr. Jasper said of his Maiden-head, I was very unwilling to die in Ignorance, and therefore resolv'd to take one Touch before I left the World. And this Production therefore being my very Virgin Issue, as such I recommend it to your kind Protection.
    </p>
    <pb xml:id="ep000581-004-a"/>
    <p>
     And now, Gentlemen, if you shall graciously please to oblige your Petitioner in your Vmbrage of this Irisle, take my honest Word, upon the Honour of a Convert and Re-convert: by my Veracity in both Churches; nay, in Church and out of Church, a Saint, a Traveller, a Dancer, Player, Poet, or whatever else, in all, and every Qualificatiton, I am,
