          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Have, long since, studied in these anti-ingenious Times, to finde out a Man, that might, at once, be both a Judge and Patron to this Issue of my Old age, which needs both. And my blessed Stars have flung me upon You: In whom both those Attributes concentre and flourish: Nor can I yet finde a reason, why I should present it to You (it being below your Acceptance or Censure) but onely my own Confidence; which had not grown to this forwardnesse, had it not been incouraged by your Goodnesse. Yet we all know, Beggars use to flock to great mens Gates. And, though my Fortune has cast me in that Mold, I am poor and proud; and preserve the humour of him, who could not beg for any thing, but great Boons, such, as are your kinde Acceptance and Protection. I dare not say (as my Brethren use) that I present this, as a Testimoniall of my Gratitude or Recompence for your Favours: For (I protest) I conceive it so far from quitting old Engagements, that it creates new. So that, all, that this Play can do, is but to make more Work; and involves me in Debts, beyond a possibility of Satisfaction. Sir, it were a folly in me, to tell you of your Worth, the World knows it enough; and are bold to say, Fortune and Nature scarce ever club'd so well. You know, Sir, I am old, and cannot cringe, nor Court, with the powder'd <pb xml:id="ep000466-003-a"/>and ribbanded Wits of our daies: But, though I cannot speak so much, I can think as well, and as honourably as the best. All the Arguments I can use to induce you to take notice of this thing of nothing, is, that it had the luck to tumble last of all in the Epidemicall ruine of the Scene; and now limps hither with a wooden Leg, to beg an Alms at your hands. I will winde up all, with a Use of Exhortation, That since the Times conspire to make us all Beggars, let us make our selves merry; which (if I am not mistaken) this drives at. Be pleased therefore, Sir, to lodge these harmlesse Beggars in the Out-houses of your thoughts; and, among the rest, Him, that in this Cuckoe time, puts in for a Membership, and will fill the Choyre of those, that Duly and truly pray for you, and is, </p>

          <l>Thou merit'st Bayes by Wit and Poetry, </l>

          <l>Those will prove Wit by Power, and make a Trade, </l>
          <l>To force by number when they can't perswade. </l>
          <l>Here's no such need: For Books, like Children, be </l>
          <l>Well Christ'ned, when their Sureties are but three. </l>
          <l>And those, which to twelve Godfathers do come, </l>

          <l>Nor need the Stationer, when all th' Wits are past, </l>
          <l>Bring his own Periwig Poetry at last. </l>
          <l>All this won't do: For, when their Labour's done, </l>
          <l>The Reader's rul'd, not by their tasts, but's own. </l>

          <l>THere is a Faction (Friend) in Town, that cries, </l>
          <l>Down with the Dagon-Poet, Iohnson dies. </l>
          <l>His Works were too elaborate, not fit </l>
          <l>To come within the Verge, or face of Wit. </l>
          <l>Beaumont and Fletcher (they say) perhaps, might </l>
          <l>Passe (well) for currant Coin, in a dark night: </l>
          <l>But Shakespeare the Plebean Driller, was </l>
          <l>Founder'd in's Pericles, and must not pass. </l>
          <l>And so, at all men flie, that have but been </l>
          <l>Thought worthy of Applause; therefore, their spleen. </l>
          <l>Ingratefull Negro-kinde, dart you your Rage </l>
          <l>Against the Beams that warm'd you, and the Stage! </l>
          <l>This malice, shews it is unhallowed heat, </l>
          <l>That boyles your Raw-brains, and your Temples beat. </l>
          <l>Adulterate Pieces may retain the Mold, </l>
          <l>Or Stamp, but want the purenesse of the Gold. </l>
          <l>But the World's mad, those Jewels that were worn </l>
          <l>In high esteem, by some, laid by in scorn; </l>
          <l>Like Indians, who their Native Wealth despise, </l>
          <l>And doat on Stranger's Trash, and Trumperies. </l>
          <l>Yet, if it be not too far spent, there is </l>
          <l>Some hopes left us, that this, thy well wrought Piece, </l>
          <l>May bring it Cure, reduce it to its sight, </l>
          <l>To judge th' difference 'twixt the Day, and Night; </l>
          <l>Draw th' Curtain of their Errours: that their sense </l>
          <l>May be conformable to Ben's Influence; </l>
          <l>And finding here, Nature and Art agree, </l>
          <l>May swear, thou liv'st in Him, and he in Thee. </l>

          <head>To Master RICHARD BROME, upon his Comedie, called, A Ioviall Crew: or, The merry Beggars. </head>
          <l>SOmthing I'd say, but not to praise thee (Friend) </l>
          <l>For thou thy self, dost best thy self commend. </l>
          <l>And he that with an Eulogie doth come, </l>
          <l>May to's own Wit raise an Encomium, </l>
          <l>But not to thine. Yet I'll before thee go, </l>
          <l>Though Whiffler-like to usher in the Shew. </l>
          <l>And like a quarter Clock, foretell the time </l>
          <l>Is come about for greater Bells to chime. </l>
          <l>I must not praise thy Poetry, nor Wit, </l>
          <l>Though both are very good; yet that's not it. </l>
          <l>The Reader in his progresse will finde more </l>
          <l>Wit in a line, than I praise in a score. </l>
          <l>I shall be read with prejudice, for each line </l>
          <l>I write of thee, or any thing that's thine, </l>
          <l>Be't Name, or Muse, will all be read of me, </l>
          <l>As if I claw'd my self, by praising thee. </l>
          <l>But though I may not praise; I hope, I may </l>
          <l>Be bold to love thee. And the World shall say </l>
          <l>I've reason for't. I love thee for thy Name; </l>
          <l>I love thee for thy Merit, and thy Fame: </l>
          <l>I love thee for thy neat and harmlesse wit, </l>
          <l>Thy Mirth that does so cleane and closely hit. </l>
          <l>Thy luck to please so well: who could go faster? </l>
          <l>At first to be the Envy of thy Master. </l>
          <l>I love thee for thy self; for who can choose </l>
          <l>But like the Fountain of so brisk a Muse? </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000466-006-a"/>
          <l>I love this Comedie, and every line, </l>
          <l>Because 'tis good, as well's because 'tis thine. </l>
          <l>Thou tell'st the World, the life that Beggars lead, </l>
          <l>'Tis seasonable, 'twill become our Trade. </l>
          <l>'T must be our study too; for in this time </l>
          <l>who'll not be innocent, since Wealth's a Crime? </l>
          <l>Thou'rt th' Ages Doctor now; for since all go </l>
          <l>To make us poor, thou mak'st us merry too. </l>
          <l>Go on, and thrive; may all thy sportings be </l>
          <l>Delightfull unto all, as th' are to me. </l>
          <l>May this so please t' encourage thee; that more </l>
          <l>May be made publick, which thou keep'st in store. </l>
          <l>That though we've lost their Dresse; we may be glad </l>
          <l>To see and think on th' happinesse we had. </l>
          <l>And thou thereby may'st make our Name to shine; </l>
          <l>'Twas Royall once; but now 'twill be Divine. </l>

        <head>Prologue. </head>
        <l>THe Title of our Play, A Ioviall Crew, </l>
        <l>May seem to promise Mirth: Which were a new, </l>
        <l>And forc'd thing, in these sad and tragick daies, </l>
        <l>For you to finde, or we expresse in Playes. </l>
        <l>We wish you, then, would change that expectation, </l>
        <l>Since Ioviall Mirth is now grown out of fashion. </l>
        <l>Or much not to expect: For, now it chances, </l>
        <l>(Our Comick Writer finding that Romances </l>
        <l>Of Lovers, through much travell and distresse, </l>
        <l>Till it be thought, no Power can redresse </l>
        <l>Th' afflicted Wanderers, though stout Chevalry </l>
        <l>Lend all his aid for their delivery; </l>
        <l>Till, lastly, some impossibility </l>
        <l>Concludes all strife, and makes a Comedie) </l>
        <l>Finding (he saies) such Stories bear the sway, </l>
        <l>Near as he could, he has compos'd a Play, </l>
        <l>Of Fortune-tellers, Damsels, and their Squires, </l>
        <l>Expos'd to strange Adventures, through the Briers </l>
        <l>Of Love and Fate. But why need I forestall </l>
        <l>What shall so soon be obvious to you all: </l>
        <l>But wish the dulnesse may make no Man sleep, </l>
        <l>Nor sadnesse of it any Woman weep. </l>

            <l>There was the whim, or double meaning on't. </l>

            <l>His son should be a man-killer, and hang'd for't: </l>
            <l>Who, after prov'd a great and rich Physician, </l>
            <l>And with great Fame ith' Universitie </l>

            <l>They may: but trust not to't. Another Schemist </l>
            <l>Found, that a squint-ey'd boy should prove a notable </l>
            <l>Pick-purse, and afterwards a most strong thief; </l>
            <l>When he grew up to be a cunning Lawyer, </l>

            <p>My pleasure, and all the search that I intend, is, by hovering here, to take a review of a brace of the handsomest Beggar-braches that ever grac'd a Ditch or a Hedge side. I past by 'em in hast, but somthing so possesses me, that I must— What the Devil must I? A Beggar? Why, Beggars are flesh and bloud; and Rags are no Diseases. Their Lice are no French Fleas. And there is much wholsommer flesh under Country Dirt, than City Painting: And less danger in Dirt and Rags, than in Ceruse and Sattin. I durst not take a touch at London, both for the present cost, and fear of an after-reckoning. But Oliver, dost thou speak like a Gentleman? fear Price or Pox, ha? Marry do I Sir: Nor can Beggar-sport be inexcusable in a young Country Gentleman, short of means, for another respect, a principal one indeed; to avoid the <pb xml:id="ep000466-033-a"/>punishment or charge of Bastardy: There's no commuting with them; or keeping of Children for them. The poor Whores, rather than part with their own, or want children at all, will steal other folks, to travel with, and move compassion. He feeds a Beggar-wench well that fils her belly with young bones. And these reasons considered, good Master Oliver— s'lid yonder they are at peep. And now sitten downe as waiting for my purpose. <stage xml:id="ep000466-e118240">Ent. Vinc. </stage>Heart here's another delay. I must shift him. Dost heare honest poor fellow?

Wherein (altho' she did not altogether transgresse the Law) she did both offend and prejudice me, an Instrument; nay, I may say, a Pillar thereof. And you, in assisting her, furthering, and conveying her away, did not onely infringe the <pb xml:id="ep000466-050-a"/>Law, in an unlawfull Departure from your Master, but in a higher point; that is to say, Top and top-Gallows high.

Hold your own peace; or, as I am a Justice of the Kings, I will unsay what I said before, and set a Currat Lex at you, Sirrah, that shall course you up the heavy Hill. Oh, is your Tongue fallen into your Leg now? Do not you know I have acquitted you? Provided— As I said before. Go your way in, and see that the Gentlemen, who, I think, were got in Sack, christned in Sack, nursed with Sack, and fed up to gray haires with onely Sack; see, I say, that they want no Sack.
