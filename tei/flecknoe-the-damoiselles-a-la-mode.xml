        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THis Comedy is taken out of several Excellent Pieces of Moliere. The main plot of the Damoiselles out of his <hi>Pretieusee's Ridiculee's</hi>; the Counterplot of Sganarelle, out of his <hi>Escole des Femmes</hi>, and out of the <hi>Escole des Marys</hi>, the two Naturals; all which like so many Pretieuse stones, I have brought out of France; and as a Lapidary set in one Jewel to adorn our <hi>English Stage</hi>: And I hope my setting them, and giving them an English foyle, has nothing diminisht of their native luster. And I have not only done like one who makes a posie out of divers flowers in which he has nothing of his own, (besides the collection, and ordering them) but like the Bee, have extracted the spirit of them into a certain Quintessence of mine own. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000563-004-a"/>
        <p>For the Language of the Pretieuse, it may be wondred that I durst attempt the Englishing it (so often attempted by our best English wits, and as often despaired of) it being a Language even new unto the French themselves, and so little understood by most of them, as they are forc'd to make a Dictionary for it apart; which notwithstanding I have done, and I hope with that success, as I have not only made the Language of the Author, English, but even the spirit, life, and quickness of it too. </p>
        <p>For my Printing it before 'tis Acted, 'tis only to give the Auditors their Bill of Fare before hand; so far from taking away their Appetites of seeing it afterwards, as (on the contrary) if they like it, it increases it but the more; and if every one who writes for the Stage wou'd but do the like, there wou'd not be so much deceit in it as there is▪ Nor do I it to render it more publick, but only more legible, (few having patience to read more then a Letter in written <pb xml:id="ep000563-004-b"/>hand) and I may well say I have found out the secret of Printing, since written Copies communicated to many, and Printed only to few, are secrets alike. </p>
        <p>For the Acting it, those who have the Governing of the Stage, have their Humours, and wou'd be intreated; and I have mine, and w'ont intreat them; and were all Drammatick VVriters of my mind, they shou'd wear their old Playes Thred-bare, e're they shou'd have any New, till they better understood their own Interest, and how to distinguish betwixt good and bad. </p>
        <p>Mean time I suppose 'twill not be difficult for all who read this Comedy, to comprehend, how the VVorld's a a Theater, every place a Stage, all vvho read and understand, Actors <pb xml:id="ep000563-005-a"/>and Auditors, and there may be as good Playes now a daies <hi>not Acted</hi>, as Acted, at our Theaters, and by our Actors here. </p>
