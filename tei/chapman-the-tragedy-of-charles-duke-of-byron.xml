            <l>Could France afford him that it pourd not on? </l>
            <l>When he was scarce arriu'd at forty yeares, </l>

            <l>So actiue, valiant, and vigilant; </l>
            <l>Can see it selfe transformed with such wild furies. </l>
            <l>And like a dreame it shewes to my conceipts, </l>
            <l>That he who by himselfe hath wonne such honor: </l>
            <l>And he to whome his father left so much, </l>

            <l>Which I denyed, to be at his disposure, </l>
            <l>Make him forgoe the whole strength of his honours? </l>
            <l>It is impossible, though the violence, </l>

            <l>Vpon our person for denying him; </l>
            <l>Yet well I found his loyall iudgment seru'd, </l>

            <l>Two hundred thousand crownes in yearely pention, </l>
            <l>And to be Generall of all the forces </l>
            <l>The Spaniards had in France; they found him still, </l>
            <l>As an vnmatcht Achilles in the warres, </l>
            <l>So a most wise Vlisses to their words, </l>

            <l>Deare friend, we must not be more true to kings, </l>
            <l>Then Kings are to their subiects, there are schooles, </l>
            <l>Now broken ope in all parts of the world, </l>
            <l>First founded in ingenious Italy, </l>
            <l>Where some conclusions of estate are held, </l>
            <l>That for a day preserue a Prince, and euer, </l>
            <l>Destroy him after: from thence men are taught, </l>
            <l>To glyde into degrees of height by crafte, </l>
            <l>And then lock in them-selues by villanie: </l>
            <l>But God, who knowes kings are not made by art, </l>
            <l>But right of Nature, nor by trechery propt, </l>
            <l>But simple vertue, once let fall from heauen, </l>
            <l>A branch of that greene tree, whose root is yet, </l>
            <l>Fast fixt aboue the starrs: which sacred branch, </l>
            <l>Wee well may liken to that Lawrell spray, </l>
            <l>That from the heauenly Eagles golden seres, </l>
            <l>Fell in the lap of great Augustus wife: </l>
            <l>Which spray once set, grew vp into a tree, </l>
            <l>Whereof were Girlonds made, and Emperors, </l>
            <l>Had their estates and foreheads crownd with them: </l>
            <l>And as the armes of that tree did decay, </l>
            <l>The race of great Augustus wore away, </l>
            <l>Nero being last of that imperiall line, </l>
            <l>The tree and Emperor together died. </l>
            <l>Religion is a branch, first set and blest </l>
            <l>By heauens highe finger in the hearts of kings, </l>
            <l>Which whilelome grew into a goodly tree, </l>
            <l>Bright Angels sat and sung vpon the twigs, </l>
            <l>And royall branches for the heads of Kings, </l>
            <l>Were twisted of them but since squint-ey'd enuye: </l>
            <l>And pale suspicion, dasht the heads of kingdomes, </l>
            <l>One gainst another: two abhorred twins, </l>
            <l>With two foule tayles: sterne Warre and Libertie, </l>
