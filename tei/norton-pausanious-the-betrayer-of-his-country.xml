        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I'M sorry for't, and beg your Pardon, like a Hangman in the Complement of his Office: but you were doom'd to fall under the Fate of your Favours to Me, and a Dedication was to light upon you, one time, or other: since the sentence was past, I thought I cou'd not execute it, with a greater justice to the trust I am engag'd in, or with more favour to you, than by bringing You upon the Stage, in the defence of a Cause, which you may so Honourably maintain: besides the present Obligation of your very good Epilogue, if I had been inclining to be merciful, made it impossible to Reprieve You any longer. </p>
        <p>This Play was put into my hands by a Man of Quality; Sink, or Swim, his Fortune was not imbarkt in this bottom; secure in the Reputation of very good Sense, he built for the Experiment, upon the Model of the Antients, and according to the reformation of the French Stage: Here is their singleness of Action, which does not so well agree with our dispositions to variety: An Action too, that seems intended to Instruct, rather than to Please, which the greatest part of an Audience wou'd never be <pb xml:id="ep000650-003-a"/>in the humour to thank him for neither. What he design'd, he has Masterly perform'd. And if Love (which begets all the success of the Stage) had faln into his subject, he wou'd have recommended that Passion as engagingly to the Ladies, and drawn it as near their Wishes, as any thing in Picture cou'd do. The Author had his reasons for the choice of this Story; and I have many to convince Me, that he cou'd not have fail'd in any other. You will find it written, to be Envy'd, rather than Excell'd, and in some places, with an Elevation, above the pitch of the Stage. Some things will need your Patronage, but many will deserve it; so the pleasure will recompense the pains of defending them. Sir, I am satisfi'd I shou'd not pretend to guid you, who have so many Lights of your Own, who have not only a thorow insight to Poetry in general, and can try it by its own Laws, but examin it by the rules of other Arts too, for you can discover thro' the Perspective of Painting whether the Parts are in Proportion, or no. With these qualifications, and inspir'd with the Soul of Musick too, you must be allow'd a Judge of these performances; as such, in justice to this cause, you are appeal'd to by </p>

        <head>PROLOGUE, </head>
        <byline>Written by an Unknown Hand; Spoken by Mr. Horden. </byline>
        <l>NEW Plays have been so frequent, all this Season; </l>
        <l>We must believe You'r tir'd, and you have Reason: </l>
        <l>Some, like Rich Timons Feasts, have pleas'd your pallates, </l>
        <l>Others have prov'd, damn'd Apemantus Sallates, </l>
        <l>What e're has hapned, or how e're disgract, </l>
        <l>We hope this night to put Your Mouths in taste: </l>
        <l>The Season of the Year our Rival grows, </l>
        <l>The Country, and the Park, are constant Foes, </l>
        <l>Which to our thoughts, like Blazing Stars appear, </l>
        <l>Foretelling our worst Fate, an Empty Theatre, </l>
        <l>Empty not only of our Noble Friends, </l>
        <l>Whom Love of Wit, or Beauty, hither sends, </l>
        <l>But ev'n our Gests o'th' Gallery will leave Vs: </l>
        <l>The Emperour of the Moon, will now deceave Vs. </l>
        <l>Nay, which is stranger yet (We han't forgot.) </l>
        <l>The very Masques, will tell you they're too hot: </l>
        <l>The Poets now Spurring their jaded Brains, </l>
        <l>Write not for Summer Lawrels, but Winter gains; </l>
        <l>Winter is their Campaign, as well as Ours: </l>
        <l>Give us the Profit, be the Pleasure yours. </l>
        <l>While thus We sigh, while thus your Absense mourn, </l>
        <l>Double our joys with Hastning your Return: </l>
        <l>Since we must soon, Wee'll strive to Leave you easy: </l>
        <l>Wee'r in no other Plot, but how to Please you. </l>

        <head>EPILOGUE, </head>
        <byline>Spoken by Mrs. Verbruggen. </byline>
        <l>'TIs sign the Poets young: is this an Age </l>
        <l>To teach you rigid Virtue on the Stage? </l>
        <l>In good Queen Besses days 'twas well enuff: </l>
        <l>But now 'tis more Ridiculous than a Ruff. </l>
        <l>Knav'ry is grown the Nations Darling Sin, </l>
        <l>And tho' a Thousand Foreign Modes comes in, </l>
        <l>Yet (like a Shirt) that's still worn next your Skin. </l>
        <l>Twas said, the French wou'd fain Invade the Nation, </l>
        <l>And here, and there made Mighty Preparation: </l>
        <l>'Tis ev'n so Bad, 'tis hardly Worth their having, </l>
        <l>At least the Beauxs wont think it Worth their Saving: </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000650-004-a"/>
        <l>And We shou'd treat him, as an Innovator </l>
        <l>Who wasts his brains, in Hopes to make it Better. </l>
        <l>Ladys confess the truth, you'd all be Loath </l>
        <l>To change your several Teas for Spartan Broath, </l>
        <l>And shou'd your Lovers be oblig'd to expose </l>
        <l>Themselves abroad against their Countrys Foes, </l>
        <l>The Nation were Vndone: there must be some </l>
        <l>To make the Money Circulate at home. </l>
        <l>Shou'd Spartan Laws prevail, I'm very certain </l>
        <l>Twou'd runie many an Honest Gentlemans Fortune. </l>
        <l>The Sharpers wou'd be Damnably unwilling </l>
        <l>To have an Act to Incourage General stealing. </l>
        <l>No, no, that wou'd their Property Invade: </l>
        <l>Ioynt-Stocks are best to Manage such a Trade. </l>
        <l>Let Vs be what we are: since 'tis our Curse, </l>
        <l>Ne're to have Chang'd but onceâ€” but for the worse: </l>
        <l>And ev'n then (Nature so much prevails) </l>
        <l>For Leeks, and Slavery, we wou'd truck Our Quails. </l>
        <l>Or else what mean Non-Swearing Pulpit-Praters? </l>
        <l>Protestant Popish Plots, and Non-Associators? </l>
        <l>Our honest Spartans shou'd not show their Faces, </l>
        <l>Where none are Patriots, but for want of Places. </l>
