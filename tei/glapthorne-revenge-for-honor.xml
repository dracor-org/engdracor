        <l>Our Author thinks 'tis not i'th power of Wit, </l>

        <l>The several phantasies which in this age </l>
        <l>With a predominant humour rule the Stage. </l>
        <l>Some men cry out for Satyr, others chuse </l>
        <l>Meerly to story to confine each Muse; </l>
        <l>Most like no Play, but such as gives large birth </l>
        <l>To that which they judiciously term mirth. </l>
        <l>Nor wil the best works with their liking crown, </l>
        <l>Except 't be grac'd with part of foole or clown. </l>
        <l>Hard and severe the task is then to write, </l>
        <l>So as may please each various appetite. </l>
        <l>Our Author hopes wel though, that in this Play, </l>
        <l>He has endeavour'd so, he justly may </l>
        <l>Gain liking from you all, unlesse those few </l>
        <l>Who wil dislike, be't ne're so good, so new; </l>

        <l>You've grac'd me sometimes in another Sphear, </l>

            <p>Murmurings, Cosen? this Peace is worse to men of war and action then fasting in the face o'th' fo, or lodging on the cold earth. Give me the Camp, say I, where in the Sutlers palace on pay-day we may the precious liquor quaff, and kisse his buxome wife; who though she be not clad in Persian Silks, or costly Tyrian Purples, has a clean skin, soft thighes, and wholsome corps, fit for the trayler of the puissant Pike, to sollace in delight with. </p>

Besides, here men o'th' Shop can gorge their mustie maws with the delicious Capon, and fat limbs of Mutton large enough to be held shoulders o'th' Ram anco●ge the 1.

Simanthes shall inform the King, the people desire Prince Abilqualit's stay; and Mura whose blunt demeanour renders him oraculous, make a shrewd inference out of it.

Caropia, thinkst thou I should fear the Nuptials of this great Empire, 'cause it was my brothers? As I succeeded him in all his glories, 'tis fit I do succeed him in his love. 'Tis true, I know thy fame fel by his practise, which had he liv'd, hee'd have restored by marriage, by it repair'd thy injur'd honors ruines. I'me bound to do it in religious conscience; It is a debt his incens'd ghost would quarrel me living for, should I not pay't with fulnesse. </p>

Think, Caropia, with what a setled unrevolting truth I have affected thee; with what heat, what pureness; and when upon mature considerations, I found I was unworthie to enjoy a treasure of such excellent grace and goodnesse, I did desist, smothering my love in anguish; anguish! to which the soul of humane torments, <pb n="59" xml:id="ep000484-030-b"/>compar'd, were pains not easie, but delicious; yet stil the secret flames of my affections, like hidden virtues in some bashful man, grew great and ferventer by those suppressions.
