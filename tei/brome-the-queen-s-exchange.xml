        <p>THis short account I thought fit to give you of this Poem, that it came to my hands among other things of this nature written, and left by Mr. Rich. Broome a person whose excellency in Comical wit has been sufficiently proved, and needs not my partial and weak commendation. There are published already of his Playes, the Northern Lass, the Antipodes, the Sparagus-garden, the Merry Beggers, the Lancashire Witches, besides the 5. Playes lately published in a Volume. The good acceptance of all which encourages me to publish this, being no way inferior to the rest; but when 'twas written, or where acted, I know not. Your kinde entertainment of this will enable me to make known to the World divers more of the same Authors works of this kind, which have not yet seen light; for my ayme is, &amp; prodesse &amp; delectare, by delighting thee to profit my self. </p>
