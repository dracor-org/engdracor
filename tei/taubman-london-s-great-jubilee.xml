        <head>To the RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir Thomas Pilkington, Kt. LORD MAYOR OF THE City of London. </head>
        <p>THO' there be several Remarkable Occurrences Contributing to the Solemnity of this Day, (as the Presence of their Majesties, the Court, &amp;c.) yet the general Joy, and Satisfaction of the City, is no less Worthy of Record, which is an Universal as their PREPARATIONS are Publick. Nor can it Chuse but add a Rubrick in the Kalender of Your Life, that you were the first Advanced to the Pretorical Chair of this Great Metropolis, after the Year of Redemption, the Happy Day of Deliverance from Pagan and Egyptian Bondage, by Miracles and Wonders. When Idolatry, like a Deluge, had Over-spread the Land, and the Church, like the Ark, lay Tottering upon the Billows, then came the Dove with the Olive-Branch of Joy; He Allay'd the Swelling of the Waters, Restoring us to our Liberty, and Religion. When Arbitrary Force, and Lawless Usurpation had Unreasonably Imposed upon us New Lords, and New Laws, contrary to the Practice, and known Customs, of this City. Then did You, in Defence of our Just Rights and Liberties, stand in the Gap, and Bravely Oppos'd the Violence of the Impetuous Torrent. So great a Champion were You, and so zealous an Asserter of these Rights, that You prefer'd our Privileges before your Liberty, and Glorying in Your Chains, while <pb xml:id="ep000775-003-a"/>You were yet a Magistrate, became Twice a Prisoner. Like Daniel, You are taken out of the Lion's Den to be a Ruler over us. Nor had those Ravenous Beasts any Power over You, altho' their Malice was sufficiently Exasperated against You. Their Jaws were stop'd till the Delivering Monarch Order'd You Enlargement, raising You Higher by Your Fall, and a greater Object of His Favour by Your Sufferings. This Royal Bounty of the Prince could not but beget in us a Grateful Emulation to Prefer You in the City, for whose sake You had Suffer'd such long and severe Persecution. The Chair being Vacant by the Death of Sir <hi>John Chapman</hi>, with one Consent You are Chosen for the remaining Time, and then with an Unanimous Heart and Voice of the Elective Assemblies to continue for the Ensuing Year. <hi>My Lord</hi>, we mention not this as a Favour done, but as a Debt due to Your Sufferings, and at last should think all this too little, were it in our Power to do more. This must stop the Mouth of Envy, that all Tongues must confess Your own Merits have most justly Advanced You. You have Asserted our Rights, Restor'd our Customs, and Immunities. Every thing runs clear in its proper Channel. That it may never again be Disturb'd by the Violence of Impetuous and Arbitrary Men, is the Prayer of </p>

This will be your Applause for what is done, that his Lordships own Merits have given him a Title thereunto. Your costly Preparations, Prudent Contrivance, and bounteous Contribution towards so glorious an Entertainment, is not only a Demonstration of your Respect to his Lordship, but of Zeal to their Majesties.

        <head>LONDON's <hi>great Jubilee Reviv'd in the Year </hi>1689. </head>
        <p>SIR <hi>John Chapman </hi>being Deceased in the Year of his Mayrolty, the Right Honourable Sir <hi>Thomas Pilkington </hi>was Chosen for the remaining Term.

This time of Election is on, or about Michaelmas-Day, there being a Month allow'd for the preparations of the Festival, which falls on the 29th of October, the next Day after Simon and Jude. During this time there is a Committee Chosen of the most Judicious and Experienced Citizens, to Contrive, Consult, Order, and Debate of all Matters Relating to the Solemnity of this Day; which, for the Antiquity of its Institution, the Grandeur of the Preparations, the Splendor of the Pageants, the Concourse of Nations, and the Stateliness of their Entertainments, may be called the greatest and most Costly in all the Univers. This Year especially Claims the preheminence, being Honoured with the Presence of their Most Sacred Majesties, the Prince, and Princess of Denmark, with all the Principal Officers of Court, and both Houses of Parliament. The Bishop of London, and all the chief Prelates of the Church. The Lords Commissioners of the Privy-Seal, the Lords Chief Justices of both Benches, the Lord Baron, and all the Learned Judges in the Law.

        <p>It is Necessary, before we come to the Description of the Pageants, to make some Remarks on the preparations of the Morning. </p>
        <p>Betwixt Seven and Eight a Clock in the Morning the whole Company, design'd for the Duty of the Day, meet at Skinners-Hall at Downgate. </p>
        <p n="1">1. The Master, Wardens, and Assistants, in Gowns faced </p>
        <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000775-004-b"/>
        <p n="2">2. The Livery in Gowns Faced with Budg, and their Hoods. </p>
        <p n="3">3. Divers Foins Batchelors in Gowns and Hoods. </p>

        <p n="5">5. Thirty Gentlemen-Ushers in Velvet-Coats, each of them a Chain of Gold about his Shoulder, and a White-Staff in his Hand. </p>

        <p n="7">7. Several Drums and Fifes with Red Scarfs, and the Colours of the Company in their Hats, Red and Yellow. </p>
        <p n="8">8. The Serjeant Trumpet, and Thirty Six Trumpets more, whereof Sixteen are their Majesties, the Serjeant-Trumpet wearing Two Scarfs, one of the Lord Mayor, another of the Companies. </p>
        <p n="9">9. The Drum-Major to the King, wearing a Shoulder-Scarf of the Companies Colours, with other of his Majesties Drums and Fifes. </p>
        <p n="10">10. The Two City-Marshals, each of them Mounted on Horse-back, with Rich Furniture, Hoosings, and Crupper Cloth Embroider'd; Six Servitors likewise Mounted to Attend with Scarfs, and Colours of the Companies. </p>
        <p n="11">11. The Foot-Marshal, and Six Attendants with the like Scarf and Colours. </p>
        <p n="12">12. The Master of Defence with the same Scarf and Colours, having Ten Persons of the same Science to Attend him. </p>
        <p n="13">13. Threescore Pensioners Accommodated with Gowns, and Caps, each of them employ'd in bearing of Standards and Banners. </p>
        <p n="14">14. Several other Pensioners in Blew-Gowns, White-Sleeves, and Black-Caps, each of them carrying a Javeling in one Hand, and a Target in the other, wherein is Painted the Coat-Armour of their Founders, and Benefactors of the Company. </p>
        <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000775-005-a"/>
        <p>Thus order'd, and accommodated, they are committed to the management of the Foot Marshal, who distributes them into Seven Divisions, and ranks them out two by two, beginning with the inferior part of the Standard Bearers. In the head of them are placed two Drums, one Fife, and one Gentleman, bearing the Company's Arms. </p>
        <p>In the Rear of them, two Gentlemen bearing Banners, being the Arms of deceased Benefactors. </p>
        <p>After them march the aged Pensioners in Gowns, and in the Centre of them fall in two Drums, beating the Dutch March, in Token of their Deliverance by the Prince of Orange, His present MAJESTY. </p>
        <p>In the Rear of them fall in three Drums, one Fife, and two Gentlemen in Plush-Coats, bearing two Banners or Ensigns, one of the KINGS, the other of the Companies. After them fall in Six Gentlemen Ushers, and likewise the Budg Batchelors. </p>
        <p>The next two Gentlemen bearing two other Banners. After them fall in Six Gentlemen Ushers, and after them the Foyns Batchelors. </p>
        <p>In the Rear of them fall in two Drums, and a Fife. Then two Gentlemen, the one bearing my Lord MAYORS, the other the City Banners. After them Twelve Gentlemen Ushers, and after them the Court of Assistance, which makes the last Division. </p>
        <p>The Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR, with the principal Aldermen and Sheriffs, while this is doing, take their usual Repasts in Skinners-Hall, while the Trumpets sound a Levit, and the Kettle-Drums eccho their harmonious Sounds in the Court. Having Notice of the Companies motion, his Lordship mounts his Horse, with the Aldermen in their Order, two by two, the Sheriffs in the Rear. </p>
        <p>In this Equipage of two and two, till taking in his Lordship and his Attendants, they march directly from Skinners-Hall through Queen-street into Cheapside, there being no Lord Mayor this Year, to join him from Guildhall. </p>
        <p>In this Order they march to the <hi>Three-Crane Wharf</hi>, where they enter into their several Barges, which are gloriously <pb n="4" xml:id="ep000775-005-b"/>adorn'd with Banners, Flags, and Pendants. His Lordship at the Stairs next Westminster for the Priority of place, as Admiral to this golden Armado; the rest of the Companies at another pair of Stairs, yet so, as in Order and Seniority: For this peaceful Navy moves not like Men of War by Couples, grapling in an Engagement, but, like Princes of the Blood, one by one, that their state may be more discernable, and their Grandeur the more remarkable. In the mean time the Gentlemen Ushers, Budge Batchellors, and Foyn Batchellors have their opportunity to repair to their several places of Defection. </p>
        <p>His Lordship being Landed at <hi>Westminster Stairs</hi>, and performed the accustomed Ceremony of taking the Oaths, comes at last to the <hi>Exchequer Bar</hi>, where the Lord Chief Baron makes an Elegant, but short Speech; which being ended, the LORD MAYOR, with his Retinue marching down Westminster-Hall, repair to their respective Barges, which return in the same Form and State they went. Nothing but Gold and Saphir represent themselves unto your view: The Pendants flying, Drums beating, Trumpets sounding, Musick playing, which is eccho'd from the several Pleasure-Boats, and others that are playing from each side with Pattarara's, and other small Pieces, to compliment them as they pass, insomuch that the Thames is nothing but a continual flowing Harmony, which never Ebbs till his Lordship is Landed. </p>
        <p>After this glorious Object upon the Water had afforded all that could be delightful to the Eye or Ear, his Lordship hastens to Black-Fryers-Stairs, where the Batchelors are ready set in order by the Foot-Marshal, as in the Morning, to attend Him, and both Bodies conjoined, march up Ludgate-Hill, and so into Cheapside, till about the Half-Moon Tavern, where his Lordship is entertain'd with the first Pageant, which is thus adorned. </p>
        <div n="1" type="pageant" xml:id="ep000775-e1160">
          <head>The First Pageant </head>
          <p>IS a Triumphant Chariot, adorn'd with Oriental Pearl, Topaz and Carbuncle. This stately Structure is carry'd by a Panther and Sable, which are the Supporters of the Right <pb n="5" xml:id="ep000775-006-a"/>Worshipful the Company of SKINNERS. Their Ensign, or Bearing, is no less Honourable and Peculiar, being Ermin in a Field Argent, Three Crowns on a Chief Gules, with Caps of the First. The Crest a Panther Couchant, with a Wreath and Lawrels about his Neck, as hath the Supporters. The Motto, <hi>To God Onely be Glory</hi>. They were formed a Society in the First of King Edward III. who was the first Founder of this ancient Society. Since this time, in so high a value was this Company with the Court; that from the first Founder no less than Six Kings have been Founders and Members of this Corporation, Edward III. Richard II. Henry IV. Henry V. Henry VI. Edward IV. Besides Nine Dukes, Two Earls, and One Lord. The Crest and Supporters of the said Arms, was obtained and granted by <hi>William Harvey </hi>Clarenceux, who was free of the same Company, <hi>Anno Dom. </hi>1561. These Arms, with the Supporters and Crest as blazon'd, are painted on an Imperial Arch of the Dorick Order in the Frontispiece of the Chariot. HONOUR placed in a distance below beats the Kettle Drum, which is an Emblem to the Martial Bands and Artillery of the City, to be ready for their Arms in Case of Defence. </p>
          <p>On a Distance above, under an Imperial Canopy of Golden Fringe, sits AUGUSTA, Representing the Famous City of London. At her Foot sit Peace and Concord before, behind Mercy and Innocency as her Attendants, which we will describe hereafter. </p>
          <p>On the Panther is mounted a Figure, Representing Wisdom; For, besides its Usefulness, it exceeds the Lyon in Cunning, being of that Subtilty, that he will decoy the Lyon from his Den, who, in hopes to make him his Prey, is catch'd himself. in the snare: For this subtile Creature being of a slenderer Shape, digs its Den to his own Dimension, wherein leaping to defend himself from the Violence of the enraged Lyon, who leaping after, sticks by the middle, and becomes his Prey. </p>
          <p>On the Sable is placed Government, because the Sable is the distinction of Honour by their Ermin, and those persons of Honour so distinguish'd: (Not by their Merits only) are the People to whom the Government is generally committed. </p>
          <pb n="6" xml:id="ep000775-006-b"/>
          <p>Honour in a Purple Robe wrought with Gold, a Mantle of White Silk Fring'd with Crimson, bearing in her Left-hand a Shield of the Companies, in her Right a Banner of my Lord Mayors. On a Coronet of Stars, Or, this Motto, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Honor solius Dei est</foreign>. </p>
          <p>Wisdom in a Silver Robe and Blew Mantle seeded with Stars, and Fring'd with Silver. In the one Hand bearing a Banner with this Inscription, <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sapientia Docet</foreign>; in the other, a Banner of the City's. </p>
          <p>Government in Armour of Silver and an Helmet; in the Right-hand, a Gold Truncheon; in the Left a Banner of the Kings. </p>
          <p>Peace in a Robe of White scatter'd with Stars; in the Left Hand a Branch of Palm; in the other a White Flag. </p>
          <p>Concord in a Crimson-Colour'd-Robe, a Sky-Colour'd-Scarf, Fring'd with Silver, Fair Bright Hair. About her Head a Garland of Red and Yellow Flowers, representing the happy Concord of King and People, Court and City in the Honour this Day Confer'd upon them, in their Majesties Presence; in her Left-hand a Shield charg'd with a Grove of Myrtles; in her Right-hand a Banner of the Companies. </p>
          <p>Mercy in a Robe of Crimson, and Silver Mantle, holding in one Hand a Spear, in the other a Banner of the City's. Innocence, with an Harmless Mild Countenance.

          <p>AN Imperial Throne gloriously Adorn'd with all manner of Jewels, Pearls, and Topaz, Mounted on a Royal Pedestal of the <hi>Compositive, Corinthian</hi>, and Roman, Order.

          <p>At a distance below, on the Torus of the Base, are placed the Four Cardinal Vertues, <hi>Prudence, Justice, Fortitude</hi>, and Temperance, as the best Support and Foundation of Monarchy, all these Vertues being naturally Inherent to our present Monarch. On the lower square of the Cornish are placed Four Figures, Representing the Four Kingdoms, quarter'd in the Royal Arms, <hi>England, Scotland, France</hi>, and Ireland, which are Habited as follow, </p>
          <p>Prudence in a Scarlet Robe, and Silver Mantle Fring'd with Gold, a Chaplet of Flowers, a Shield Vert, charg'd with a Dove Argent, bearing a Banner of the City. </p>

          <p>Scotland in a Blew Robe, a Silver-Mantle, and a Scarf of Gold; a Chaplet of Thistles, with their Leaves about her Head. In her Left-hand a Shield, bearing St. Andrew's Cross; in her Right, a Banner of the Kings. </p>
          <p>France in an Azure-Colour'd-Robe, spangl'd with Gold <hi>- Flower-De-Luces</hi>. A Crown Imperial dropping, of which he supports with one Hand, bearing in the other a Banner of my Lord Mayor's Arms. </p>

            <hi>The Third Pageant</hi>. The Ship PERSEVS, and ANDROMEDA, from the LEVANT, Inward Bound. </head>
          <p>AS a further Mark of their Bounty, the Company have this Year Added the Ship Perseus and Andromeda, Inward Bound, from the LEVANT, Laden with Spices, Silks, Furs, Sables, Panthers, and all manner of Beasts Skins, hanging in the Shrouds and Rigging. This Ship is peculiarly Attributed to the Lord Mayor, as a proper Emblem and Characteristick of his way of Traffick and Adventure, being a <hi>Turkey Merchant</hi>. Nor is the Name of Perseus and Andromeda less properly Apply'd, having Analogy and Respect, as well to his Lordship, as the Company. Perseus was the Son of Jupiter and <hi>Danae. Mercury </hi>gave him Wings, that is, Sails, with which he Mounts his Pegasus, that is, his <pb n="10" xml:id="ep000775-008-b"/>Ship, wherein he slew the <hi>Gorgons, Medusa, Sthenio</hi>, and Euryole. He Cut off Medusa's Head, whose Hair were Serpents, the Emblem of Envy, and placed it in his Shield. This is peculiarly Adopted to his Lordship, who has overcome his Malicious Enemies, and this Day Rides in Triumph over them. Minerva gives him a Golden shield Cover'd with a Goat Skin, called Aegis, which is an Hieroglyphick of the Companies. He Rescues Andromeda from the Sea-Monster; the Moral is, the Church from the Deluge, that was ready to Over-flow it. How Applicable this is to the present Revolutions of this Year, will need no Comment to Explain. </p>
          <p>This Ship has on Board it a Jolly Brave Captain, Master, Gunner and his Mate, Boatswain, Pilot, besides the ship's Crew, continually Toping, Bousing, and Carousing, who for Joy of coming into England, having the Pot, or Quarter-Can, continually at their Noses, get Merry with Drinking their Majesties, and his Lordships Health, discharging a Cannon at every Round. The Boatswain giving the signal with his Whistle, Three great Huzza's are given, and the Health is renew'd with a Cannon, as before, and a Bowl of Punch. </p>
          <p>Boatswain, Sixty Fathoms and an half, Ho; Helm a Lee, starboard, hard a Port, thus, keep her thus; there, there, fall not off, brave Boy, well steer'd, Pilot, and better Con'd. Helm a Lee. This Son of a Whore he'll Overset us, Loof, Loof, you Dog, No Near. What a yaw this <hi>Lubberly-Land Crab </hi>has made us, steady, steady, Port, there she scuds away. </p>
