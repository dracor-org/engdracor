        <p>YOu see I come unarm'd among you, sine Virga aut Ferula, without Rod or Ferular, which are the Pedants weapons. Id est, that is to say, I come not hither to be an Instructor to any of you, that were Aquilam volare docere, aut Delphinum natare, to teach the Ape, well learned as my selfe. Nor came I to instruct the Comedians. That were for me to be Asinus inter simias, the fool o'the Company: I dare not undertake them. I am no Paedagogus nor Hypodidascalus here. I approach not hither ad erudiendum, nec ad Corrigendum. Nay I have given my Schollars leave to play, to get a Vacuum for my selfe to day, to Act a particle here in a Play; an Actor being wanting that could beare it with port and state enough. A Pedant is not easily imitated. Therefore in person, I for your delight have <pb xml:id="ep000808-146-a"/>left my Schoole to tread the Stage. Pray Jove the terror of my brow spoile not your mirth, for you cannot forget the fury of a Tutor, when you have layne under the blazing Comet of his wrath, with quaeso Praeceptor te precor da— &amp;c. But, let feare passe, nothing but mirth's intended. </p>
        <p>But I had forgot my selfe, A Prologue should be in Rhyme, &amp;c. therefore I will begin agen. </p>

          <l>Kind Gentlemen, and men of gentle kinde, </l>
          <l>There is in that a figure, as you'll finde, </l>
          <l>Because weel take your eares as 'twere in Ropes, </l>
          <l>Ile nothing speak but figures, strayns &amp; tropes. </l>

          <l>Quot quot adestis Salvete salvetote. </l>
          <l>The Schoolemaster that never yet besought yee, </l>
          <l>Is now become a suitor, that you'll sit, </l>
          <l>And exercise your Judgement with your wit, </l>
          <l>On this our Comedy, which in bold Phrase, </l>
          <l>The Author sayes has past with good applause </l>
          <l>In former times. For it was written, when </l>
          <l>It bore just Judgement, and the seal of Ben </l>
          <l>Some in this round may have both seen't, and heard, </l>
          <l>Ere I, that beare its title, wore a Beard. </l>
          <l>My sute is therefore that you will not looke, </l>
          <l>To find more in the Title then the Booke. </l>
          <l>My part the Pedant, though it seem a Columne </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000808-146-b"/>
          <l>Is but a Page, compar'd to the whole volume. </l>
          <l>What bulk have I to bear a Scene to passe, </l>
          <l>But by your favours multiplying Glasse. </l>
          <l>In nova fert Animus, then Ile do my best </l>
          <l>To gaine your Plaudite among the rest. </l>

Her Eye artificially spirited, her Cheek surphuled, her Teeth blanch'd, her Lip painted, her Neck carkanetted, and her Brest bar'd almost to her Belly.
