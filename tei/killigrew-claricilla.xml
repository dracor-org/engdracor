            <p>I should blush at this, if there needed more Arguments to confirm I shall be victorious than the reward propos'd; for had the Gods intended the far-fam'd Claricilla's Virtues a Reward for Treason they would not then have left her Virtue such a Guard, whose power hath stood amongst Traitors when yours fell upon the faith that bore it. </p>

            <p>The story how he came to be thus happy we'll reserve to crown our Feast with; Manlius, thy part in the success of this day shall not be forgotten.
