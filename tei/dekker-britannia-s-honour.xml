        <head>Brittannia's Honor: Brightly shining in seuerall Magnificent Shewes or Pageants, to Celebrate the Solemnity of the Right Honorable RICHARD DEANE, at his Inauguration into the Majoralty of the Honorable Citty of London, on Wensday the 29. of October. 1628. </head>
        <p>WHat Honor can bee greater to a Kingdome, than to haue a Citty for beauty, able to match with the Fairest in the World? A Citty, renowned Abroad, admired at Home. London, and her Royall Daughter (Westminster) are the Representatiue body of the general State; for, here our Kings and Queenes keepe their Courts; heere are our Princes, the Peeres, Nobility, Gentry, Lords Spirituall and Temporall, with the Numerous Communalty. </p>
        <p>London in Forraine Countries is called the Queene of Cities, and the Queene-mother ouer her owne. She is her Kings Chamber-royall, his Golden-Key: His Store-house: The Magazine of Merchandize; the Mistris of Sciences; a Nurse to all the Shieres in England. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000375-004-a"/>
        <p>So famous shee is for her Buildings, that Troy has leap'd out of her own Cinders, to build Her Wals. So remarkable for Priority and Power, that hers is the Master-wheele of the whole Kingdome: As that moues, so the maine Engine works. </p>
        <p>London is Admirall ouer the Nauy royall of Cities: And as she sayles, the whole Fleete of them keepe their course. </p>
        <p>Fully to write downe all the Titles, Stiles, and Honors of this our Metrapolis, would weary a 1000. pennes: Apollo shall haue a New Garland of Bayes, to vndertake it. </p>
        <p>As thus in State, shee her selfe is Glorious; so haue all our Kings held it fit to make her chiefe Ruler eminent, and answerable to her greatnesse. The Praetorian Dignity is therefore come from the ancient Romans, to inuest with Robes of Honor, our Lord Maior of London: Their Consuls are our Sheriefes; their Senators our Aldermen. </p>
        <p>The extention of a Lord Maiors power, is euery yeare to bee seene both by Land and Water: Downe as low as Lee in Essex: Vp, as high as Stanes in Middlesex: In both which places, he keepes personall Courts. His House is a Chancery: He the Chancellor to mittigate the fury of Law: Hee the Moderator betweene the griping Rich and the wrangling Poore. </p>
        <p>All the City Orphans call him Father: All the Widdowes call him their Champion. His Table lyes spread to Courtiers, and Free to all Gentlemen of fashion. </p>
        <p>More to Proclaime his Greatnesse, what Vice-roy is install'd with louder popular acclamations? What Deputie to his Soveraigne goes along with such Triumphes? To behold them, Kings, Queenes, Princes, and Embassadors (from all parts of the World) haue with Admiration, reioyced. </p>
        <p>These Triumphall passages are full of Magnificence for State, Munificence for Cost, and Beneficence for doing good. For, besides all the twelue Companies, (euery one of which is a gayner by this imployment:) it would puzzle a good memory <pb xml:id="ep000375-004-b"/>to reckon vp all those Trades-men (with other extraordinary Professions which liue not in the City) who get money by this Action. </p>
        <p>Then by this meanes, are euery Yeare added to those that were before, three Faire, Spacious, and Pallacious Houses, Beautified, Painted, and Adorned. </p>
        <p>The Lord Maior of London (like a Prince) hath likewise his Variety of Noble Recreations: As Hunting, Shooting, Wrastling, before him, and such like. </p>
        <p>Thus hauing (as it were in Lantschip) a farre off shewne you the Toppes onely of our City-Buildings; and in a little Picture drawne the Face of her Authority, giuing but a glimpse of her Praetor as hee passes by; let mee now open a Booke to you, of all those Ceremonies, which this great Festiuall day hath prouided to Attend vppon him, and doe him Honor. </p>
        <div n="1" type="part" xml:id="ep000375-e100360">
          <head>The first Shew, is called a Sea-Consort. </head>
          <p>The first Salutation being on the Water, is furnished with Persons and Properties fitting the quality of that Element. An Artificiall Rocke therefore is queintly contriued: On whose highest Ascent fits Amphitrite Queene of the Seas, habited to her State; a Mantle frindg'd with siluer crossing her Body: Her hayre long, and disheuelled, on her head, a phantasticke dressing made out of a Fishes writhen shell, interwouen with Pearle, the shell is siluer, on the top of it stands an Artificiall moouing Torroyse: On each side of her, swimme two Mermaides. These two intic'd by the variety of seuerall instruments (ecchoing to one another) haue followed the Sea Soueraigne, and waite vppon her, as Maides of Honor. </p>
          <p>Round about the Rocke are Sea-Nimphes, and in places conuenient for them are bestowed our three famous Riuers, Humber, Trent, and Seuerne, aptly attired according to the quality of such Marine Persons, who play vpon Cornets. </p>

          <head>The fourth Presentation is Called Brittannia's watch-Tower. </head>
          <p>THis is a Magnificent Structure, Aduancing it selfe from the Platforme, or Ground-worke vpward, with the Bewty of eight Antique Termes, By whose strength is supported a Foure square Building; The Toppe of which is a Watch-Tower, or Lanthorne, with eight Columnes of siluer: And, on the Highest poynt of this Watch-Tower, is Aduanced a Banner, bearing the Cullors of the Kingdome. </p>
          <p>At foure Corners of the vpper Square, stand foure Pendants; <pb xml:id="ep000375-009-a"/>In which are the Armes of the foure Companies of which his Lordship is Free. </p>
          <p>At each end of this Platforme, stands a great Corynthian Brazen Pillar, on a Pedestall of Marble. </p>
          <p>On the Capitals of those Pillars, stand two Angels, in Postures ready to flye: holding Garlands of Victory in one hand, stucke with White and Red Roses, and Branches of Palme in the other. </p>
          <p>The Capitals and Bases of the Pillars are Gold, and are Emblemes of the two Houses of Yorke and Lancaster; once diuided, but now Ioyned into One Glorious Building, to Support This Royal Kingdom, &amp; Consequently This Citty. </p>
          <p>At Night, in place of the Angels, are set two Great Lights: and so is the Watch-Tower at that Time, Filld with lighted Tapers. </p>
          <p>Vpon the same Square, in foure seuerall Places, are Aduanced foure stately Pyramides, being Figures, of the foure Kingdomes Embellished with Escutcheons. </p>
          <p>In the vpper seate of all (fashioned into a Throne) is placed Britannia, Maiestically attirde, fitting to her Greatnesse. </p>
          <p>Beneath Her, and round about Her, are these Persons: viz. Magnanimity with a drawne Sword. </p>
          <p>A Shipwright with a Mallet, holding a Scutcheon, in which is drawne a Ship vnder sayle. Then, A person representing Victory, with a Palme Tree. Prouidence with a Trumpet, ready to Foresee Dangers, and awaken Men to meete them. </p>
          <p>All These haue bene, and still are, Watch-Towers, and Lanthornes, in the Nights of Feare and Trouble, to Guard the Kingdome, and in the Kingdome, This Citty. </p>
          <p>In other Eminent places are seated some of those Kinges of England (in Robes Ermynd) whose loues and Royall fauors, in former times were Watch-Towers to Grace London, <pb xml:id="ep000375-009-b"/>stucke full with the Beames and Lights of Honors, Titles, Offices, Magistracies and Royalties, which they Bestowed vppon Her. </p>
          <p>Edward Confessor, called Londons Chiefe Ruler, a Port-reue. Richard 1. appointed two Bayliffes ouer London. </p>
          <p>King Iohn gaue the Citty a Lord Maior and two Sheriffes. Henry 3. added Aldermen. </p>
          <p>These were Tender ouer the Renowne of the Citty, and still heaped on her head, Royalties vpon Royalties. </p>
          <p>And albeit most of our Kinges, haue in most of all of the twelue Companies, Entred their Names, as Free of the Societies, thereby to Royallize their Brotherhoods: And that many of our Kinges likewise, besides Princes and Great Personages, haue bin Free of This Company, whose Names I forbeare to set downe, because they haue in former yeeres beene fully exprest: yet no Company, did euer, or can hereafter, receiue such Graces from Kinges, as This Antient, and Honord Corporation of Skinners, hath had, and still haue, In regard that All our Kinges and Princes, sit in their high Courts of Parliament in Robes Ermynd, (being the richest Furre) the workemanship of which goes through the Skinners fingers, wearing likewise vnder their Crownes, Royall Caps of Honor Ermynd. </p>
          <p>Three of such Crownes, beeing the rich Armes of This Company, thereby expressing as well their Honor, as Antiquity. </p>
          <p>Britannia deliuers thus much. </p>
