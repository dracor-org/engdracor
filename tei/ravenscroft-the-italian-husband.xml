          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHen Poets dedicate to Great Men, their servile Genius stoops to Flattery: They write not their just sentiments, but what they think will please their Patrons: So, to make them great, they debase themselves, and become Idolaters of Images, gilded by their own praise. As well may the Carver adore his Statues, the Painter his Pictures, which are their own handyworks. To shew my dislike of this Custom, I chose to expose this Tragedy to the publick with no other ornament than your name. But let not the world mistake me; for you have Virtues that render you more valuable than Titles. They that know you love you, for you will not let the least of your acquaintance <pb xml:id="ep000699-003-a"/>go unobliged whenever you can find opportunity to show your generous temper. Believe me, Sir, I esteem your friendship, and the name of Friend is preferrable to any title that descends by Birth, or what Monarchs can confer; the first comes without desert, the latter oftner by Chance than Merit. Let other Poets then boast Patrons of Quality, whilst I, more happy I, enjoy my Friend, I am my Friend and my Friend is Me. Oh he is absent yet, but when he comes, the chearful Bottle shall tune our souls to as high a rapture, as if we were met at the Harmonions Feast of Great Cecilia. Haste then, thou worthy man, and chear the hearts of all your Friends. None in your absence more devoutly wishes your return, than </p>

        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e920">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>'Tis the same amongst the French and Italians. </p>

          <pb xml:id="ep000699-004-a"/>
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>I'll tell you: A Play is not call'd a Farce from any number of Acts, but from the lowness of the Subject and Characters; which are not true Characters in Nature, nor just representations of humane actions (as Comedy is or should be) but from the oddness and extravagancy of the Characters and Subject: Which, tho not natural, yet not always against Nature; and tho not true, yet diverting, and foolishly delightful. A Farce is like a Dutch piece of Painting, or a Grotesque Figure, extravagant and pleasant. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1040">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>In my judgment it is so. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1070">
          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>Well, we'll pass over that point. But why do you make a Tragedy but three Acts? </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1100">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>O, that's customary in other Countries. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1130">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>I have observ'd that many Plays of late are all talk and no business; others have some business, but so much talk, that the business is almost lost in the multiplicity of words, and the Plays lag and grow tedions. Therefore, to avoid this, I have now laid the business so close, that every Scene may seem necessary to carry on the design and story of the Play, and with as few words as I cou'd suppose sufficient; therefore I confine my self to three Acts, which gives me also opportunity to introduce some Musical Entertainments, and those seeming natural to the Play; which few Poets have yet observ'd. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1160">
          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>I confess they bring in their Musick by head and shoulders, and may serve in one Play as well as another. But the main objection against your Play is, Your Lady, or chief Character in your Play, being of Quality, and a marry'd woman, sees a young Lord, hearkens to his Love, and gives up her Honour in the first Act, without much ceremony or couttship: How will the Boxes like this, Sir? There you are lost. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1190">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>Mr. Peregrine, you have been a Traveller, and are a fit Judge: In the first place, I say this great Lady and her Lover were not strangers to each other, courtship had formerly past betwixt them, they were contracted by Vows; but being separated before they could be joined in Marriage, and <pb xml:id="ep000699-004-b"/>despairing ever to see one another again, the Lady is marry'd. By accident they see each other, have opportunity of discourse, their Love renews, the Gallant presses, the Lady is frail, and they agreed upon the present moment. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1230">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>Where lies the Scene? </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1260">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>In Italy; you know it is not there as in England, where we have easie access, and freedom of conversation, and opportunity of Courtship. An opportunity there once lost, is not to be recovered. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1310">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>Right, therefore, there if the Gentleman likes the Lady, and the Lady the Gentleman, they presently come to the point. An Italian Dame wou'd think you a very dull, heavy, phlegmatick Lover, if you shou'd waste time in idle Ceremony and Compliments. When Love is the Banquet, they fall to without saying Grace, I can tell you. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1350">
          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>Ay, but the custom of that Country won't be an excuse here. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1380">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>But it ought; for if the Scene lies in a foreign Country, the Poet may write after the custom of that Country. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1410">
          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>But they won't like a great Lady losing her Honor; they won't like that, Sir. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1440">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>It is not the design of my Play to expose a Lady's frailty, so much as to raise her up to virtue when fallen. I intend her fall not an example for vice. The great design being to bring a guilty person to be pity'd in her circumstances. Many Plays have made the Vertuous in misfortunes to be pity'd, but the Guilty never yet, as I remember. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1470">
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>Very well: That design indeed is new, I like it. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1500">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>And lastly, Sir, to show what evils may follow one ill action, tho repented on as soon as done. And let the Moral of the Play show, that one error brings more fatal consequences than many virtuous actions can remedy; and therefore, tho it is good to repent of ill, 'tis better not to do ill: </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1530">
          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>I like your Moral well enough; I have but one thing more to say, your Play has no lofty flights, nor ne're a fine dying Speech. </p>
        </sp>
        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1560">
          <pb xml:id="ep000699-005-a"/>
          <speaker>Per. </speaker>
          <p>We have too much of them in every Play. </p>

        <sp xml:id="ep000699-e1590">
          <speaker>Po. </speaker>
          <p>I have endeavour'd in this to make my persons speak like men and women, and in such words as the real persons represented might be supposed to discourse in the same circumstance. The Scene lyes in Italy, and I have writ in the stile of the Italian Tragedies; how it may please here I know not. </p>

          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>Ay, but Sir, you have left out Similies: ' Y Gad I scarce remember three Similies in the whole Play; and Mr. Peregrine I am a passionate lover of Similies. </p>

          <speaker>Per. </speaker>

          <speaker>Crit. </speaker>
          <p>Too many Similies! ' Y Gad Mr. Peregrine now I question your judgment: Oh! they are the prettiest things in nature. I had as live see, The Firmament without Stars, A Tree without Blossoms, A Garden without Flowers, A Lady's Face without Patches, or A Pudding without Plumbs, as a Play without Similies. There are your Similies now! who cou'd have exprest so much Wit without Similies? </p>

        <l>Without your friendly help can ne're be paid. </l>
        <l>With helps of Folly you Manure the Soil, </l>
        <l>To make it grateful to the Tillers Toil. </l>
        <l>Like Vintners we on impositions live, </l>
        <l>And at the expence of those who Tax us, thrive. </l>
        <l>Yet Poets say, in one thing you'r unkind, </l>
        <l>Wit ye expect— </l>
        <l>But what Wit is, no man has yet defin'd. </l>
        <l>Thus whilst we wander in a doubtful Maze, </l>
        <l>'Tis only our good fortune if we please, </l>
        <l>And when we start a Play, full cry you run, </l>
        <l>And ne're leave Yelping till you've run it down. </l>
        <l>Rules you prescribe, but when you try the Cause, </l>
        <l>We find each Criticks Whimsies are thy Laws. </l>
        <l>So, when of Wit, each Palat's made the test. </l>
        <l>Good plays are damn'd, because you've lost your taste. </l>
        <l>He that wou'd furnish out a modish treat, </l>
        <l>Shou'd strive to please with varions sort of meat. </l>
        <l>To feed the Beaus with Farce is very good, </l>
        <l>Those Babes in Wit can't bear substantial food. </l>
        <l>For men of sense some Satyr shou'd be got. </l>
        <l>For Politicians to be sure, a Plot. </l>
        <l>With Swanish Puns you may regale the Cit, </l>
        <l>Their swinish taste delights in husks of Wit. </l>
        <l>But he that would secure a good third day, </l>
        <l>Must show your Vices to you, to save his Play. </l>
        <l>Lest Bully like, eager to purchase Fame, </l>
        <l>You shou'd your follies in the Poet Dam. </l>
        <l>These are the Rules I heard our Author say: </l>
        <l>But Bays forsooth has found a newer way. </l>
        <l>Which, if it miss, he swears he shall be uneasy, </l>
        <l>To think he was not fool enough to please ye. </l>

        <byline>Writ by Jo. Haynes. </byline>
        <byline>Spoke by Mr. Bowman, mimicking a Beau. </byline>
        <l>LOaded with Muffe, and Nose adorn'd with Snush, </l>
        <l>Eclips'd <hi>in Wig</hi>, like Owl in Ivey-Bush. </l>
        <l>With dangling Shoulder-knot o're Arm a kimbo, </l>
        <l>In fine embroyder'd Coat <hi>Just out of Limbo</hi>. </l>
        <l>With all the Rhethorick of DOUX YEUX, I come </l>
        <l>To mitigate our trembling Author's doom; </l>
        <l>Who bid me beg your Smiles, (the Poets Alms,) </l>
        <l>In words as moving as the <hi>Singing Psalms</hi>. </l>
        <l>Not doubting my success, because he knows, </l>
        <l>The <hi>Fair Sex </hi>must be obliging to the Beaux, </l>
        <l>For while those Gallants, who had Brains to spare, </l>
        <l>For Honor ran Campaigning every year, </l>
        <l>
          <hi>Love! Love</hi>! The nobler Province of the two, </l>
        <l>Kept peaceful Beau at home to dye for you: </l>
        <l>Not that he fear'd the Wars, but some chance blow </l>
        <l>Might beat out his <hi>Fine Teeth</hi>, and then you know, </l>
        <l>Tho he, (the Man) were sav'd, that kills the Beau. </l>
        <l>Whose Courage might, no doubt, successful prove, </l>
        <l>In Bed of Honor, as in Bed of Love. </l>
        <l>But whether think you has the greater Charms, </l>
        <l>Don Mars the Bully's, or Don Cupid's Arms? </l>
        <l>Who in this glorious Field Cupid makes his Campaign, </l>
        <l>So fam'd for <hi>killing Eyes</hi>, and Lovers slain. </l>
        <l>Like Caesar here the Beaux may Conquest hoast, </l>
        <l>They come, they ogle, and the Heart is lost. </l>
        <l>For wonder then they're in such Vencration, </l>
        <l>But I remember Monkeys once in Fashion. </l>
        <l>Till these new Favorites obtain'd their Station. </l>

        <l>To the prevailing Charms of <hi>Rival Beau. </hi>
        </l>
        <l>But tell me pray how wou'd this Peacock show, </l>

        <l>If those who clubb'd to's Beauship flock'd together, </l>

        <l>Sword, Feather, Musse, and no Charms left to sin in. </l>
        <l>What a <hi>Figu— re </hi>he'd make you easily guess, </l>
