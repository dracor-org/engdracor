        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>IT is the Fate of Strangers to the Town, </l>
        <l>To have the Play and Prologue too their own: </l>
        <l>Whilst Writers here for one another sweat, </l>
        <l>Clubbing like Carr-men when a Brother's set. </l>
        <l>Nay, dull insipid Farce you will commend </l>
        <l>For sake of Prologue-writing gifted Friend; </l>
        <l>Some gentle follower of the Wits, who thinks </l>
        <l>He sucks in Poetry when-e're he drinks. </l>
        <l>Since these have left no Formal So or Thus, </l>
        <l>I'll bluntly tell you what you'll have from us. </l>
        <l>Know then our Poet ventures more by far </l>
        <l>Then all the blustering Hero's of the War. </l>
        <l>For he without a Second does engage </l>
        <l>Throngs of a fulsome bawdy scribing Age; </l>
        <l>And dares in th' midst of cry'd-up Satyr vent </l>
        <l>What you'll acknowledge nicely innocent. </l>
        <l>'Tis bold and new, and 'mongst the ruffling Toys, </l>
        <l>Whose Wit is beastly Impudence and Noise, </l>
        <l>He knows he's damn'd; but wou'd be so on choice. </l>
        <l>Ladies, for you he writ, much griev'd to see </l>
        <l>Your best of Pleasures, harmless Comedy, </l>
        <l>Made Bawd to such mean durty Ribaldry </l>
        <l>As scarce is known to th' Offall of the Gallery. </l>
        <l>Shou'd he miscarry, 'tis in such a Cause </l>
        <l>Will challenge Pardon, if not gain Applause. </l>
        <l>Be kind, he's young, and on your hands may mend. </l>
        <l>'Tis something so to write as not t'offend. </l>

Know then, that very night I had concluded the advantageous Match for this false Woman, with Don <hi>Alonso Fonseca</hi>, the great Heir, returning late home, brisk with wine, and over-joy'd at the Success, I entred at the Garden-door, which I found open, and all the House silent as Death. Fear of my greatest Treasure wing'd me to her Chamber: where, to my perpetual Torment, I found that Letter. Oh Carlos! canst thou guess the Sighs of Merchants in a Storm, or utmost Pangs of Parents o're their dying Hopes? such was my Treasure, such my Loss and Grief. </p>

        <l>IF any of you have a mind to ●ight, </l>
        <l>Let him affront our pretty Female-knight. </l>
        <l>For though her rambling Errantry is done; </l>
        <l>Since she's in danger of your damning Frown, </l>
        <l>Here as her Squire a Challenge I proclaim: </l>
        <l>Declare your Weapon, Time, and Place, and Name. </l>
        <l>When you shall own with shame, upon your knees, </l>
        <l>You fail much oftner then our Sex, to please. </l>
        <l>Perhaps her Servant by the Ladies may </l>
        <l>Be censur'd, that he basely ran away: </l>
        <l>But few, when they'd attain'd so much, would stay. </l>
        <l>Yet now the Power's by Marriage in her hand, </l>
        <l>Who may at leisure due Revenge command. </l>
        <l>For if he goes this year to the Campaign, </l>
        <l>A Friend may in his stead at home remain. </l>
        <l>Gallants, I needs must pray for some of you, </l>
        <l>Who with such heat to the Low-Countries go, </l>
        <l>That when you come again, if e're you do, </l>
        <l>You may be welcom'd with the loss of some rich Friend, </l>
        <l>Who's made you Heir to all he left behind. </l>
        <l>And be assur'd we'll prove exceeding kind </l>
        <l>To those who come with Scars of Honour home, </l>
        <l>If to inherit good Estates they come. </l>
        <l>'Faith then, to us be favourable now, </l>
        <l>That we hereafter may be so to you. </l>
        <l>For those who mean to stay within the Nation, </l>
        <l>Let all new Plays now have their Approbation, </l>
        <l>Considering shortly comes a long Vacation: </l>
        <l>'Gainst when, we shall no more reserve new Play, </l>
        <l>Then Vintner stock of French-wine till May-day. </l>
