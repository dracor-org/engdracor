        <head>Upon AGLAƲRA printed in Folio. </head>
        <l>By this large Margent did the Poet mean </l>
        <l>To have a Comment writ upon his Scene? </l>
        <l>Or is it that the Ladies, who ne're look </l>
        <l>On any but a Poeme or Play-book, </l>
        <l>May, in each page, have space to scribble down </l>
        <l>When such a Lord, or Fashion comes to Town. </l>
        <l>As Swaines in Almanacks account do keep, </l>
        <l>When their Cow calv'd, and when they bought their sheep? </l>
        <l>Ink is the life of Paper: 'tis meet then, </l>
        <l>That this which scap'd the Press should feel the Pen. </l>
        <l>A Room with one side furnish'd, or a face </l>
        <l>Painted half-way, is but a faire disgrace. </l>
        <l>This great voluminous Pamphlet may be said </l>
        <l>To be like one that hath more haire then head; </l>
        <l>More excrement then body. Trees, which sprout </l>
        <l>With broadest leaves, have still the smallest fruit. </l>
        <l>When I saw so much white, I did begin </l>
        <l>To think Aglaura either did lie in, </l>
        <l>Or else took Pennance. Never did I see </l>
        <l>(unlesse in Bills dasht In the Chancerie). </l>
        <l>So little in so much; as if the feet </l>
        <l>Of Poetry, like Law, were sold by th'sheet. </l>
        <l>If this new fashion should but last one yeare, </l>
        <l>Poets, as Clerks, would make our paper dear. </l>
        <l>Doth not the Artist erre, and blast his fame </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000811-100-a"/>
        <l>That sets out pictures lesser then the frame? </l>
        <l>Was ever Chamberlaine so mad, to dare </l>
        <l>To lodge a childe in the great Bed at Ware? </l>
        <l>Aglaura would please better, did she lie </l>
        <l>I'th' narrow bounds of an Epitomie. </l>
        <l>Pieces that are weav'd of the finest twist, </l>
        <l>(As Silk and Plush) have still more stuffe then list. </l>
        <l>She, that in Persian habit made great brags, </l>
        <l>Degenerates in this excesse of rags; </l>
        <l>Who, by her Giant-bulk this only gaines, </l>
        <l>Perchance in Libraries to hang in chaines. </l>
        <l>Tis not in Book, as Cloth; we never say </l>
        <l>Make London-measure, when we buy a Play: </l>
        <l>But rather have them pair'd: Those leaves be faire </l>
        <l>To the judicious, which more spotted are. </l>
        <l>Give me the sociable Pocket-books. </l>

What new Plantation was ever peopled with the better sort at first; nay, commonly, the lewdest blades, and naughtypacks are either necessitated to 'hem, or else do prove the most forward venturers.

And do not weeds creep up first in all Gardens? and why not then in this? which never was a Garden until now; and which will be the Garden of Gardens, I foresee't.

That he is upon a point of discovery in a most excellent project for the weeding of this Garden? what Garden? what project? A project he says here for the good of the Republike, Repudding. This fellow has in stead of braines, a Cob-web in his Noddle, with little strawes, feathers, and wings of dead Butterflies hanging in it, that having motion by his aery fancie, there dance and keep a Racket; 'tis to teach women silence, or some such foolish impossibility. He is ambitious to be call'd into authority by notice taken of some special service he is able to do the tate aforehand. But what great service he is able to do it, or which way to undertake it, falls not in the reach of my imagination. But good Mr. Croswill, by your favour now, what reason have you to slight or wrangle at this man? this honest Cockbrayne? that has alwayes been a constant friend to you, and officious in many good wayes, and is a Gentleman, not only of good descent and estate, but of a good disposition. And you two, Mr. Crossewill, by your leave, have alwayes agreed like <pb n="78" xml:id="ep000811-141-a"/>neighbours children. I, the divel was in't, and now he vexes me again; we agreed in one point so well, that we have undone a couple of our children by it, and hindred the getting of I know not how many more. His son and my daughter should have married. And on a sndden he and I both consented to a dislike of the match and broke it, and have both repented it an hundred times since. We agree very wel in that point; and now is his son irrecoverably lost, and my daughter resolutely bent to be an Ape-leader in Limbo. But what's all this to the affliction I suffer in my sons now? that one of them from a riotous boy. should grow into a Puritanical Woodcock; and the tother from a civil well-qualified fellow, turn'd absolute Ruffian. There, there, I there's the devil in't. I could beat my selfe for getting such children. </p>
