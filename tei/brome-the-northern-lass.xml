Your loue to witty, and pleasant Recreations of this nature hath brought her on: And Northern Spirits will soone wex bold.

              <p>The very same sir. But I beginne to call him now, as I must call him hereafter. Ladies doe not call their husbands, as they are Knights: as sir Phillip, sir Timothy, or sir Gregory. Did you ever heare my Lady Squelch call her husband sir Paul? No. But master Squelch. Indeed all others must sir them by their Christen names; because they are Knights, and to bee knowne from other men: onely their owne wiues must master them, by their Sirnames; because they are Ladies, and will not know them from other men. But to our busines. What said he to you? </p>

To study and practise the Art of iealousie; To faine anger, melancholly, or sicknesse, to the life. These are Arts that women must bee well practis'd in, ere they can attaine to wisedome, and ought to be the onely study of a widow, from the death of her first husband, to the second: From the second to the third, matters of deeper moment; From the third to the fourth deeper yet; And so proportionably to the seauenth, if shee be so long blest with life: But of these I may finde time hereafter to consider in order as they fall. Besides, in all, to be singular in our will; to raigne, gouerne, ordaine lawes and breake 'hem, make quarrells and maintaine 'him; professe truthes, deuise falshoods; protest obedience, but study nothing more then to make our husbands so; Controle, controuert, contradict, and be contrary to all conformity: To which end wee must be sure to be arm'd alwayes with prick and praise of the deceased; and cary the Inuentory of our goods, and the grosse summe of our Dowry perpetually in our mouthes. Then dos a husband tickle the spleene of a woman, when shee can anger him to please him; chide him to kisse him; Mad him to humble him; make him stiffe necked to supple him; and hard-hearted to breake him; to set him vp, and take him downe, and vp againe, and downe againe, when, and as often as we list. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
