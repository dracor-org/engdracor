        <head>TO THE RIGHT WORTHIE, AND All-accomplisht Gentleman, Sir THOMAS FINCH, Knight BARONET. </head>
        <p>SIR, let it not appeare strange, that I doe aspire to your Patronage. Things that taste of any goodnesse, loue to bee shelter'd neere Goodnesse: Nor do I flatter in this (which I hate) onely touch at the originall Copy of your vertues. Some of my other Works, as The white Deuill, The Dutchesse of Malfi, Guise, and others, you haue formerly seene; I present this humbly to kisse your hands, and to find your allowance. Nor doe I much doubt it, knowing the greatest of the Caesars, haue cheerefully entertain'd lesse Poems then this: and had I thought it vnworthy, I had not enquired after so worthy a Patronage. Your selfe I vnderstand, to bee all curtesie. I doubt not therefore of your acceptance, but resolue, that my election is happie. For which fauour done mee, I shall euer rest </p>

        <head>TO THE IVDITIOVS READER. </head>
        <p>I Hold it, in these kind of Poems with that of Horace, Sapientia prima, stultitia caruisle; to bee free from those vices, which proceed from ignorance; of which I take it, this Play will ingeniously acquit it selfe. I doe chiefly therefore expose it to the Iudicious: Locus est, &amp; pluribus Vmbris, others haue leaue to sit downe, and reade it, who come vnbidden. But to these, should a man present them with the most excellent Musicke, it would delight them no more, then Auriculas Citherae collecta sorde dolentes. I will not further insist vpon the approouement of it, for I am so farre from praising my selfe, that I haue not giuen way to diuers of my Friends, whose vnbeg'd Commendatory Verses offered themselues to doe me seruice in the Front of this Poeme. A great part of the grace of this (I confesse) lay in Action; yet can no Action euer be gracious, where the decency of the Language, and Ingenious structure of the Scaene, arriue not to make vp a perfect Harmony. What I haue fayl'd of this, You that haue approoued my other Workes, (when you haue read this) taxe me of. For the rest, Non ego Ventosae Plebis, Suffragia venor. </p>
