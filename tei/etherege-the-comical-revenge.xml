        <p>I Cou'd not have wish'd my self more fortunate then I have been in the success of this Poem: The Writing of it was a means to make me known to your Lordship; The Acting of it has lost me no Reputation; And the Printing of it has now given me an opportunity to shew how much I honour you. </p>
        <p>I here dedicate it, as I have long since dedicated my self, to your Lordship: Let the humble Love of the Giver make you set some value upon the worthless Gift: I hope it may have some esteem with others, because <pb xml:id="ep000561-003-a"/>the Author knows how to esteem you, whose Knowledg moves admiration, and Goodness love, in all that know you. But I design this a Dedication, not a Panegerick; not to proclaim your Virtues to the World, but to shew your Lordship how firmly they have oblig'd me to be, </p>

        <l>WHo cou'd expect such crowding here to day, </l>
        <l>Meerly on the report of a new Play? </l>
        <l>A man wou'd think y'ave been so often bit </l>
        <l>By us of late, you shou'd have learn'd more wit, </l>
        <l>And first have sent a Forlorne-hope to spy </l>
        <l>The Plot and Language of our Comedy, </l>
        <l>Expecting till some desp'rate Critticks had </l>
        <l>Resolv'd you whether it were good or bad: </l>
        <l>But yet we hope you'l never grow so wise; </l>
        <l>For if you shou'd, we and our Comedies </l>
        <l>Must trip to Norwich, or for Ireland go, </l>
        <l>And never fix, but, like a Puppit-show, </l>
        <l>Remove from Town to Town, from Fair to Fair, </l>
        <l>Seeking fit Chapmen to put off our Ware. </l>
        <l>For such our Fortune is this barren Age, </l>
        <l>That Faction now, not Wit, supports the Stage: </l>
        <l>Wit has, like Painting, had her happy flights, </l>
        <l>And in peculiar Ages reach'd her heights, </l>
        <l>Though now declin'd; yet cou'd some able Pen </l>
        <l>Match Fletcher's Nature, or the Art of Ben, </l>
        <l>The Old and Graver sort wou'd scarce allow </l>
        <l>Those Plays were good, because we writ them now. </l>
        <l>Our Author therefore begs you wou'd forget, </l>
        <l>Most Reverend Iudges, the Records of Wit, </l>
        <l>And only think upon the modern way </l>
        <l>Of writing, whilst y'are Censuring his Play. </l>
        <l>And Gallants, as for you, talk loud i'th Pit, </l>
        <l>Divert your selves and Friends with your own Wit; </l>
        <l>Observe the Ladies, and neglect the Play; </l>
        <l>Or else 'tis fear'd we are undone to day. </l>
