        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE Sir ROBERT HOWARD, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>ATrifle of this kind is so little worthy your attention, that I know not how to make a fair way for its appearance, and beg you to give it audience. The Muses are become so prostitute, that every Enthusiast begets a work on'em; Plays are grown meer Foundlings, and generated so fast, that we find one or more laid at the door of every Noble-Man; and these impudent Begetters are not satisfy'd that you give their unlawful Issue a maintenance and reering, but have the Conscience also to expect a Reward for easing themselves on you of their ungodly burthen. Sir, I must confess I am little better than a lewd Sinner of this Order, but have so much Grace and Modesty at least to require no Recompense where I ought to be begging Pardon for committing a slip of this nature. I am confident I cou'd not chuse a more indulgent Foster-Father; and tho' my very Name bears an accusation against me, yet I have the honour also to be related to the Muses by the Mothers side; for you your self have been guilty of Poetry, and a Family Vice is therefore the more excusable in me, who am unluckily a Poet by descent. Poesie is a Noble Exercise, and like a reserv'd Game seems intended wholly for the recreation of Learned Gentlemen, or such at least as have had liberal Education, and these have still succeeded best in it: But we see the illiterate breaking in daily on the Quarry, and even those assuming, to themselves the name of Poets, who never had any other call to that Art <pb xml:id="ep000535-003-a"/>beside the hope of a third day. If one half of us who set up for making Plays, understood what Horace says in these Lines, it may be we should not vainly presume to think our selves what indeed we are not. </p>
        <p>
          <q>Descriptas servare Vices, operumque Colores, Cur Ego, si nequeo, ignoroque Poeta salutor. </q>
        </p>
        <p>Shakespear among all the Writers of our Nation may stand by himself as a Phoenix, the first and last of his Order; in whom bounteous Nature wonderfully supply'd all the parts of a great Poet, and Excellent Oratour; and of whom alone one may venture boldly to say, that had he had more Learning, perhaps he might have been less a Poet. 'Tis certain the good nature of the Town suffers any thing for the sake of Novelty and Entertainment, however meagre, and the encouraging some miserable Writers, is to be allow'd more an act of Charity than Judgment; for tho' Poverty be generally the end of a Poet, I think it is but a very lamentable beginning. There is a large difference between those, who following the itch of gaining empty applause, mispend their time in writing themselves into necessity, and such who spend their time in writing themselves out of it; and where the Muse begins with the want of a Meals-meat. The former might be any thing else better than what they chuse to be; the latter, because they can be nothing else, wou'd fain be Poets. 'Tis dangerous making a Pastime of any one thing so long, that at last we are glad to embrace it as a Profession; like those, who after they have melted all their Substance in search of the Philosopher's-Stone, are forc'd in the end to turn Chymists. But of this enough; for I am already conscious to my self of deviating something from my Theme, and can only form this application out of what I have said, that you, Sir, have prudently known how to make the best use of your Excellent Talent in this kind, by applying it to your diversion, and the unbending your Mind. By these means, you have happily given our Country a great Poet in your Writings; and at the same time have not omitted the more necessary part of giving her a Great States-Man, and Heroe; to which Eminency your Birth, Courage, and Capacity have equally rais'd you. And shou'd I enlarge on these Heads, I am confident the World wou'd not tax me of the least flattery, and I shou'd only be guilty of not giving you your due; but you are reserv'd for a better Pen, and silence <pb xml:id="ep000535-003-b"/>therefore is a good fault in me. I have only now to beg pardon for sending so mean a Trifle so long a Voyage; 'tis so full of faults I know not how to give it the name of a Play. The Italians when they know not what to make of a thing, call it <hi>Un Pasticcio Inglese</hi>, what kind Complement they intend our Country in the Expression I know not, but I believe they mean no better than a Hotch-podge. 'Tis my first Poetical Cookery of this sort, and whatever it be, I humbly submit it to your Censure, but more to your Patronage; and with it, </p>

        <head>THE PREFACE OF Mr. Dryden, to his Son's Play. </head>
        <p>I Have thought convenient to acquaint the Reader with somewhat concerning this Comedy, though perhaps not worth his knowledge. It was sent me from Italy some years since, by my second Son, to try its fortune on the Stage: And being the Essay of a young unexperienc'd Author; to confess the truth, I thought it not worthy of that honour. 'Tis true, I was not willing to discourage him so far, as to tell him plainly my Opinion, but it seems he guess'd somewhat of my Mind, by my long delays of his expectation: And therefore in my absence from the Town last Summer, took the boldness to Dedicate his Play to that Person of Honour, whose Name you will find before his Epistle. It was receiv'd by that Noble Gentleman with so much Candor and Generosity, as neither my Son nor I cou'd deserve from him. Then the Play was no longer in my power, the Patron demanding it in his own right, it was deliver'd to him. And he was farther pleas'd, during my Sickness, to put it into that Method in which you find it; the loose Scenes <pb xml:id="ep000535-004-b"/>digested into order, and knit into a Tale. As it is, I think it may pass amongst the rest of our New Plays; I know but two Authors, and they are both my Friends, who have done better since the Revolution. This I dare venture to maintain, that the Tast of the Age is wretchedly deprav'd, in all sorts of Poetry, nothing almost but what is abominably bad can please. The young Hounds who ought to come behind, now lead the pack, but they miserably mistake the scent. Their Poets, worthy of such an Audience, know not how to distinguish their Characters; the Manners are all alike inconsistent and interfering with each other. There is scarce a Man or Woman of God's making in all their Farces: yet they raise an unnatural sort of laughter, the common effect of Buffoonry; and the Rabble which takes this for Wit, will endure no better, because 'tis above their Understanding. This account I take from the best Judges, for I thank God, I have had the grace hitherto to avoid the seeing or reading of their Gallimaufries. But 'tis the latter end of a Century, and I hope the next will begin better. This Play I dare assure the Reader is none of those; it may want Beauties, but the faults are neither gross, nor many. Perfection in any Art is not suddenly obtain'd; the Author of this, to his misfortune, left his Country at a time when he was to have learn'd the Language. The Story he has treated, was an Accident which happen'd at Rome, though he has transferr'd the Scene to England. If it shall please God to restore him to me, I may perhaps inform him better of the Rules of Writing; and if I am not partial, he has already shewn, that a Genius is not wanting to him. <pb xml:id="ep000535-005-a"/>All that I can reasonably fear, is that the perpetual good success of ill Plays may make him endeavour to please by writing worse, and by accommodating himself to the wretched capacity and liking of the present Audience, from which, Heaven defend any of my Progeny. A Poet indeed, must live by the many, but a good Poet will make it his business to please the few. I will not proceed farther on a Subject which arraigns so many of the Readers. For what remains, both my Son and I are extreamly oblig'd to my dear Friend Mr. Congreve, whose Excellent Prologue was one of the greatest Ornaments of the Play. Neither is my Epilogue the worst which I have written; though it seems at the first sight to expose our young Clergy with too much freedom. It was on that Consideration that I had once begun it otherwise, and deliver'd the Copy of it to be spoken, in case the first part of it had given offence. This I will give you partly in my own justification, and partly too, because I think it not unworthy of your sight. Only remembring you that the last line connects the sense to the ensuing part of it. Farewell, Reader, if you are a Father you will forgive me, if not, you will when you are a Father. </p>

          <l>Time was when none cou'd Preach without Degrees, </l>
          <l>And seven years toil at Universities: </l>
          <l>But when the Canting Saints came once in play, </l>
          <l>The Spirit did their bus'ness in a day: </l>
          <l>A Zealous Cobler with the gift of Tongue, </l>
          <l>If he cou'd Pray six hours, might Preach as long: </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000535-005-b"/>
          <l>Thus, in the Primitive Times of Poetry, </l>
          <l>The Stage to none but Men of sense was free. </l>
          <l>But thanks to your judicious tast, my Masters, </l>
          <l>It lies in common now to Poetasters. </l>
          <l>You set them up, and 'till you dare Condemn, </l>
          <l>The Satire lies on you, and not on them. </l>
          <l>When Mountebanks their Drugs at Market cry, </l>
          <l>Is it their fault to sell, or yours to buye? </l>
          <l>'Tis true, they write with ease, and well they may, </l>
          <l>Fly-blows are gotten every Summers day, </l>
          <l>The Poet does but buz, and there's a Play. </l>

          <l>THIS Year has been Remarkable two ways, </l>
          <l>For Blooming Poets, and for Blasted Plays. </l>
          <l>We've been by much appearing Plenty mock'd, </l>
          <l>At once both tantaliz'd, and over-stock'd. </l>
          <l>Our Authors too, by their success of late, </l>
          <l>Begin to think third days are out of date: </l>
          <l>What can the Cause be, that our Plays won't keep, </l>
          <l>Unless they have a Rott some Years like Sheep? </l>
          <l>For our parts, we confess we're quite asham'd </l>
          <l>To read such Weekly-Bills of Poets damn'd. </l>
          <l>Each Parish knows 'tis but a mournful Case </l>
          <l>When Christnings fall, and Funerals encrease. </l>
          <l>Thus 'tis, and thus 'twill be when we are dead, </l>
          <l>There will be Writers that will ne'er be read. </l>
          <l>Why will you be such Wits, and write such things? </l>
          <l>You're willing to be Wasps, but want the stings. </l>
          <l>Let not your Spleen provoke you to that height, </l>
          <l>'Odslife you don't know what you do, Sirs, when you write. </l>
          <l>You'll find that Pegasus has tricks, when try'd, </l>
          <l>Tho' you make nothing on't but up and ride; </l>
          <l>Ladies and all, I faith, now get astride. </l>
          <l>Contriving Characters, and Scenes, and Plots, </l>
          <l>Is grown as common now, as knitting Knots; </l>
          <l>With the same ease, and negligence of thought, </l>
          <l>The Charming Play is writ, and Fringe is wrought. </l>
          <l>Tho' this is frightful, yet we're more afraid, </l>
          <l>When Ladies leave, that Beaux will take the Trade: </l>
          <l>Thus far 'tis well enough, if here 'twould stop, </l>
          <l>But should they write, we must e'en shut up shop. </l>
          <l>How shall we make this Mode of Writing sink? </l>
          <l>A Mode said I? 'Tis a Disease, I think, </l>
          <l>A stubborn Tetter that's not Cur'd with Ink. </l>
          <l>For still it spreads, 'till each th' infection takes, </l>
          <l>And seizes ten for one that it forsakes: </l>
          <l>Our Play to day is sprung from none of these, </l>
          <l>Nor should you Damn it, tho' it does not please, </l>
          <l>Since born without the bounds of your four Seas. </l>
          <l>〈◊〉 if you grant no savour as 'tis new, </l>
          <l>Yet as a Stranger, there is something due: </l>
          <l>From Rome (to try its fate) this Play was sent, </l>
          <l>Start not at Rome, for there's no Popery meant; </l>
          <l>Where e'er the Poet does his dwelling chuse, </l>
          <l>Yet still he knows his Country claims his Muse </l>
          <l>Hither an Offering his First- Born he sends, </l>
          <l>Whose good, or ill success, on you depends. </l>
          <l>Yet he has hope some kindness may be shown, </l>
          <l>As due to greater Merit than his own, </l>
          <l>And begs the Sire may for the Son attone. </l>
          <l>There's his last Refuge, if the PLAY don't take, </l>
          <l>Yet spare Young Dryden for his Father's sake. </l>

        <lg>
          <l>LIKE some raw Sophister that mounts the Pulpit, </l>
          <l>So trembles a young Poet at a full Pit </l>
          <l>Unus'd to Crowds, the Parson quakes for fear, </l>
          <l>And wonders how the Devil he durst come there; </l>
          <l>Wanting three Talents needful for the Place, </l>
          <l>Some Beard, some Learning, and some little Grace: </l>
          <l>Nor is the Puny Poet void of Care; </l>
          <l>For Authors, such as our new Authors are, </l>
          <l>Have not much Learning, nor much Wit to spare: </l>
          <l>And as for Grace, to tell the truth, there's scarce one, </l>
          <l>But has as little as the very Parson: </l>
          <l>Both say, they Preach and Write for your Instruction: </l>
          <l>But 'tis for a Third Day, and for Induction. </l>
          <l>The difference is, that tho' you like the Play, </l>
          <l>The Poet's gain is ne'er beyond his Day. </l>
          <l>But with their Pardon 'tis another Case, </l>
          <l>He, without Holiness, may rise to Grace; </l>
          <l>The Poet has one disadvantage more, </l>
          <l>That if his Play be dull, he 's Damm'd all o'er, </l>
          <l>Not only a damn'd Blockhead, but damn'd Poor. </l>
          <l>But Dullness well becomes the Sable Garment; </l>
          <l>I warrant that ne'er spoil'd a Priest's Preferment; </l>
          <l>Wit's not his Business, and as Wit now goes, </l>
          <l>Sirs, 'tis not so much yours as you suppose, </l>
          <l>For you like nothing now but nauseous Beaux. </l>
          <l>You laugh not, Gallants, as by proof appears, </l>
          <l>At what his Beauship says, but what he wears; </l>
          <l>So 'tis your Eyes are tickled, not your Ears: </l>
          <l>The Taylor and the Furrier find the Stuff, </l>
          <l>The Wit lies in the Dress, and monstrous Muff. </l>
          <l>The Truth on't is, the Payment of the Pit </l>
          <l>Is like for like, Clipt Money for Clipt Wit. </l>
          <l>You cannot from our absent Author hope </l>
          <l>He should equip the Stage with such a Fop: </l>
          <l>Fools Change in England, and new Fools arise, </l>
          <l>For tho' th' Immortal Species never dies, </l>
          <l>Yet ev'ry Year new Maggots make new Flies. </l>
          <l>But where he lives abroad, he scarce can find </l>
          <l>One Fool, for Million that he left behind. </l>

I have been Marry'd a whole half year, in which time I have had more business on my hands than a Secretary of State, have rais'd more Out-works than any Governour of a Citadel to preserve my Wife's Chastity: In short, I am so broken and brought down with this blessed half year of Wedlock, that at the end of the next half, I am of Opinion I shall be Celebrated with the Anniversary of my Funeral; the Doctors have almost given me over already. </p>

              <p>In order to which, you took a Wife, a very pretty retreat from Business and the World, and an excellent Cordial for a Man in a declining Condition; then to finish the happiness of your retreat, you are most abominably jealous, and take all the care imaginable to divulge it to the World, by depriving your Wife of those Christian Liberties which all Wise Men allow theirs; as you order your affairs, Neighbour, you had as good make a publick Proclamation in the Streets of London, I have a pretty young Wife, who will make me a Cuckold, you do the same thing in effect already. </p>

              <p>Forget, say you, that would be more than any married Man in Christendom could ever do yet; but I remember it as seldom, and with as little regret as possibly I can: I have been married now these ten years, that is to say, I have served almost two Apprentiships to Matrimony, 'twere hard if I were not Master of my Vocation. </p>

              <p>you that are so good at decyphering other Peoples looks, had best look at home; since I am provoked to speak my mind, I have observed that there is a certain swindging two-handed well set black Doctor, who comes very often to feel your Lady's Pulse, I think they call him the Ladies Doctor in the Town, but he looks more like a Horn Doctor; I am of opinion your Lady is not so often indispos'd for nothing. </p>

              <p>You mean Doctor Lorman, that insignificant Fop Doctor, who has not the tenth part of the Learning of a Mountebank in Lincolns-Inn-Fields, a meer Crevat and Periwig one, who never knew beyond the composition of a Washball or a Pomatum, or how to prescribe a Clyster for my Lady's Lap-Dog.
