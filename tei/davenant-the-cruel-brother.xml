I could vrge the dignitie of Drammatick-Poems, but that were vainly to direct, rather then wooe, an acceptation. Those errors, your Lordshippes leasure shall vouchsafe to reade in this Tragedy, are its originall Crimes, hauing receiu'd no examination since the Birth, and being aduised to correct it, by a suruay, I sayd; I had study'd your Lordship, <pb xml:id="ep000364-003-b"/>and would not lessen, the noble office of your Mercy.
