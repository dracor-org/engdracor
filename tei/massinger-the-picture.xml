        <p>IT may bee obiected, my not inscribing their names, or tittles, to whom I dedicate this Poem, proceedeth either from my diffidence of their affection to me, or their vnwillingnes to be publishde the Patrons of a trifle. To such as shall make so strict an inquisition of mee, I truely answere. The Play in the presentment found such a generall approbation, that it gaue mee assurance of their fauour to whose protection it is now sacred, and they haue profes'd they so sincerely allow of it, and the maker, that they would haue freely granted that in the publication, which for some reasons. I denide selfe one, and that is a maine one: I had rather inioy (as I haue donne) the reall proofes of their friendship, then mountebancke like boast their <pb xml:id="ep000170-003-a"/>numbers in a Catalogue. Accept it noble gentlemen as a confirmation of his seruice who hath nothing else to assure you, and witnes to the world how much he stands ingagd for your soe frequent bounties, and in your charitable opinion of me beleeue, that you now may, and shall euer command, </p>
