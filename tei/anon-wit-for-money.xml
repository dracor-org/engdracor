     <hi>
      CRITICK CATCALL
     </hi>
     sends Greeting.
    </head>
    <p>
     YOV have shown your self so Penitent after the Poetical Correction you received from me, that to retaliate (tho late) the Honour you did me in chusing me for your Patron, I return you Epistle for Epistle, and make you the Patron of the following Dialogue: It reflects on a certain Namesake and Country man of yours, and some Plays of his lately Launch'd out; but that's all one, since it may turn to as good an account to you as some of yours; and your own practise of sacrificing your friends, to your own, and the Town's Jests, justifies it.
    </p>
    <p>
     Indeed, I must confess, 'tis a sad Age we live in, since the applause of the Town, from Exalted Box, to more Exalted upper Gallery, the routing the Jacobites, stilling the Criticks, and drowning their Hisses, by the loud repeated Claps of the lusty fisted Champions of your Party, able to have drown'd those of Thunder it self, and all the Kitts and Fiddles of your Antagonists of the nimble Craft; I say, 'tis a sad Age seriously, since all this cannot secure a man from censure, or a Play from being taken to pieces, which altogether made so pretty a figure: 'tis as uncharitable as the exposing the false Hair, Teeth, Calves, Eyes, and Eye-brows, &amp;c. of our antiquated Beaux and Ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
     Such is the malice of some prying envious Persons, not having the fear of Satyrists before their Eyes, that they most feloniously, barbarously, and wickedly, like Rival Women, search for, nay, make and
     <pb xml:id="ep000805-003-a"/>
     find faults in others, as industriously as they seek to hide their own But what shall I say to it? Alas! 'tis the general custom of you Authors, (the more's the pity) like Mastives you bark at, claw and worry one another, whilst others cry hollow, and heartily laugh at you for your pains. Other Societies protect and shoulder one another, but you, like so many Game Cocks turn'd loose together, fall foul of the next you meet: Or to speak more Poetically, like Cadmus's Soldiers, cut and slash your fellows without mercy. Is there no means to stop this fury? From the Cobler that mends your Shooes, to the rich Goldsmith that keeps your &#12296;&#9674;&#12297;, there are Halls for their Corporations in London; 'tis pitty yours in Beotia is not removed a little nearer, or that your Master Apollo doth not send from Parnassus some Deputy to govern you here, that being once united, as much as you are divided, the Trade (for by your leave, 'tis now a Trade as much as those I Nam'd) may flourish, and the Proverb be a Lyar, which bars Poets from becoming Aldermen. This would be very necessary at present that the Indisposition of the Laureat is like to spill as much Blood as Ink among you; for from the Modern Play-writers, to the high toppers of the Profession, I expect to find you all at Daggers drawing; should he be so civil to you to leave us in haste
     <hi>
      (I hope he will not)
     </hi>
     to make a visit to his Brothers Terence, and
     <hi>
      Ben Johnson
     </hi>
     , in the Elizian Fields.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Author of this Mushroom hopes all this will attone for his presumption; he desired me to recommend it to you to have it made into a Play, and hopes you may prove as prevailing a Patron, as your Party was to get yours a Name, and a third day, and hinder it from sinking under the weight of those who did not like it: some of whom were something sawcy, and us'd these words out of a Play of a certain Poet, who before the Poll Acts, used to write himself
     <hi>
      T. D.
     </hi>
     Gentleman: That,
     <hi>
      should we not sometimes dive into the secrets of Wit, and reprove mistakes, these Rascally Poets would grow Insolent; we should be perpetually tormented with Lampoons.
     </hi>
     It was hard in them to reverse the saying upon its Author, tho amongst Authors, 'tis no more than the reflections of Lawyers against one another at the Bar. It helps to make you famous, and I am much mistaken, if some of you would not be as thankful for a severe Criticism in Print, as for a Copy of Verses in praise of your Works.
    </p>
    <p>
     Had my Author attach'd your friend in his worst Plays, he could
     <pb xml:id="ep000805-003-b"/>
     have had a cheaper Victory, and the other a greater Overthrow; but he has done as those Generals who slight little weak Towns to set down before the Capital City; which may please the Party concern'd, as much as it would the Governour of the Town to see it attack'd on the strongest side. I need not then Apologize to any of the Fraternity for my friends Observations on that score, but rather to the Town, for telling them 'tis dark at Midnight, that crack'd Skulls are not found, and that some Writers Vpper-rooms are unfurnish'd. This undigested product of a few spare hours, is as needless to some Criticks, as a Treatise of the bulk of the Book of Martyrs, to prove that Maevius was a bad Poet, or a Lecture of War to a great Commander. But tho they do not want to inform their Iudgments, they may something to make chem merry, when they have as little to do as my friend when he writ it; had he been Master of leisure enough to have revised it, it would have appeared in a better Dress, and have had less roughness in the Style, and perhaps more in the Satyr. The smoothness of your Pen may Redress the first, and if you think he has been too mild in the other, which I must confess was at my Request, let me know it, and you will have no cause to complain to my knowledge, this being at the best but a Rough-draught or the Sketch of his Poet. I think there is enough drawn to discover who sat for it, and tho the finishing strokes being wanting, it may well be said that the Picture is somewhat unlike; I dare say 'tis after the way of our Modern Painters, and of you Freeholders of Parnassus, in the Panegyricks of your Patrons, and consequently not for the worse, my friend having us'd yours more kindly than your Abdicated Brother Bays hath been, and made him speak a Language he hath no cause to be asham'd of, tho perhaps he himself may.
    </p>
    <p>
     I hope the Name of Stutter will no more offend than that of
     <hi>
      Weesilion, Poet Belly, Lady Stroddle, Coopee,
     </hi>
     &amp;c. which bear your Stamp, but if you think that of Balladwright or Maggot properer, you may new Nick-name that worthy Person, my friend not designing it as a mock upon any infirmity of speech (a thing to be pitied) but as a distinguishing mark of his Hero, who Stutters more in sence yet than in Elocution.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Plot he leaves to you, who have such a Collection of yours and other mens in your head, your Invention seldom coming so short of your Imagination, but that the supply of a good memory makes you
     <pb xml:id="ep000805-004-a"/>
     amends: He knows you can as little want the addition of Songs and Dances to adorn it, as a Scholar newly returned from the Vniversity, his Tropes and Figures, or a Girl just Ween'd from the Boarding-School her Mennet or Rigodoon.
    </p>
    <p>
     Here I should inlarge upon your Merits, your Indefatigable Writing, in spight of all discouragements, the substance of your Wit, the Ingenuity of your Conversation, your generosity in the profuse and continual distribution of your Songs, the mildness of your Satyrs, the solidity of your Burlesque, the niceness of your Politicks, your care in obliging both Parties with your Poems: But above all, the fluidity of your Style, and your Laborious Industry in tacking together pieces and remnants of Plots and Humours, and making them your own for the diversion of those who had never seen them, in the state of their first Creation. But all this were fitter from your own Pen, and I hope you will not be so far wanting to your self, as not to oblige us with it one day, since no other Pen yet ever dared undertake it; tho I must confess, such Salutes amongst Authors, are as unnecessary as between Men of War at Sea, 'tis but wasting Powder which may be put to a more profitable use, therefore they may better be reserv'd for the future Epistle to the Patron of this Embryo; and who knows (between you and I) but it may hook in 20 Guinea's, if you Cull your man right.
    </p>
    <p>
     And now I think it high time to take my leave, for 1 perceive my Epistle is swell'd to a bulk, and it only belongs to such as can Wire-draw them to the purpose, to hold us at the Door as long as they please, for in an unknown Scribbler 'tis as unmannerly as a Chamber-maids Chat, when you are impatient to be admitted into her Mistresses Bed-chamber. For my part, I generally pass them over as some do Greek when they don't understand it, with a
     <foreign xml:lang="lat">
      Transeat Graecum est
     </foreign>
     , they being as little to the purpose as the Prologues to some of our Plays; but lest I be task'd with the fault of those, who with multiplicity of words blame others overtalk, I have done, and according to the form of Letters, rest

      Ay, and there is need they shou'd; but the Town of late, have like true Libertines, shunn'd Faces and Plays once seen, whether good or bad, and serv'd them all alike; but there's hopes they'll Recant, and after their roving fit, they may be more constant; for to be tir'd with change, is the first step towards the settling our affections; and since when we have been but one Week in the Country, we find so much the want of the Play-House, that the very Strowlers are then welcome to us. I dare say, the Town can no more be without Plays, than a brisk young Widdow without a Husband or a Gallant.

      Therefore he's the fitter to Write such things; they only seem calculated for the Meridian of the City Coffee-Houses, where sense is as great a stranger as amongst the true bred Teagues, or the Bethlemitish Collegians; who yet sometimes will drop you a Witticism by chance. One while he rails at the Priests, another at the French, laughs at the Irish; and in the whole, banters all, and the work's done. They are all alike, from the first to the last; I wou'd confine him to Scotch Songs, I mean such of them as our Gay People of both Sexes call Scotch, tho' they want as much the Dialect, as the sense of some of that Country.

What if a man will exalt a Weesil, and Trap him afterwards, rail at the Clergy in one place, and commend them in another, side with the Grumblers in one thing, then lash them in the next, Write Trimming Songs and Panegyricks on the City Magistrates in this Reign, and wish them

It doth not signify a farthing (from whence it comes,) 'tis like Musick, the different and thwarting parts set one another off. Do you think Rats and Weesils, Moralizing Atheists, dull Panegyricks, worse than Lampoons and Lampoons, more glorious to those they are meant to, than Panegyricks by those hands? Songs, Ballads, Drolls and Farces, signify a pin on either side? No, to mind those things, is the business of those that have none; and tho the Authors of those

      It can be no easy matter to reconcile me to the Pro's and Cons of such Mercenary Pens, they bring the whole Body Politick of Poetry into disgrace and contempt, like Drawcansir, they spare neither Friend nor Foe, provided there be something to be got by it; and as the Whores give Love for Money, they as meanly expose Wit for Money, till Punk and Scribbler grow as loath'd and common one as the other. The Law hath provided a House of Correction for the one, and since Satyr is too mild to lash the others, 'tis pity there is not some other means us'd to silence them, that the better Pens, and the Men of honester Principles, may no longer suffer for the faults of those; and when these Torrents and Inundations of the spurious, muddy, mingled stuff of those Dabblers, which now drowns the Town, is drain'd, Wit and Merit need not be asham'd to appear abroad, but flow in their Natural Channel.

      That may be, and yet the Character may be borrowed, for in Humours and Characters, it happens as with those German Pictures, where a Man or a Woman are drawn so, that a dozen different dresses painted on Izing-glass may suit to the same face; and so it may be said the humour is still the same, tho you dress it another way; it hath the same looks tho' it be disguis'd; as your French man is, for though you have made
      <pb n="16" xml:id="ep000805-012-a"/>
      him a Jacobite French man, yet he is but a French man still, and such a French man as no Beau will ever be fond of aping; so that after so many excellent Masters from whom you've drawn your Copy, and who have tired their Pens, and then the Town on that subject, 'tis to be admired you have not drawn him better; and as for crying up his King, we had enough of that in Bury-Fair. Indeed the merry (not to say the unthinking) part of the Audience were well pleas'd with him, and always will; the enmity between the Nations giving a relish to the Part, even in Bartholomew-Fair, tho had he, who acted the part like a good Fiddle, been well tun'd, he would have made better Musick.

      Well, go on and prosper, Tom, you would be sure of success, were we ruled by Laws such as those of the Kingdom of the Moon; which, by the way, I think as well imagined as those of Sir Tho. Moore's Utopia. They say that there old men honour and serve the young, as being in body and mind fitter for the service of their Country. 'Gad, I believe you had fared very well in that World, their Language being all Musick, and their Money all Verse.

      But the Musick must be good, and the Verse bear the Hall-mark, for like the late Brass Irish Coyn, it does not go for what Fools may take it, but for its real value; and one Stanza of Spencer's there, may outweigh a whole Quarles, or a Verse of Hudibras, a Cart-load of his Ghosts.

      Sir, I have grafted of twig upon him, which I have called his Ghost, and for all your opinion, I believe that if any man hath come to his heighth, 'tis I have done it; no Author ever exploded my Works, nor writ against them so as to come to particulars, which is no small pride and comfort to me, since the most celebrated Pens have been often carp'd at, and examin'd, even in the best of their Works; and Indictments of Poetical Thefts, Murders and Treasons drawn against them. No man was ever yet so bold as to answer me, so that sometimes I have
      <pb n="29" xml:id="ep000805-018-b"/>
      been forced to answer my self, when my hand was in. I believe they have lookt on my Poetry, as Armies on those Towns they dare not Besiege; I have had now and then a Bomb thrown at me, but tho surrounded with Enemies, none of them ever presumed beyond a Blocade, for had they made a formal attack, they had certainly lost by it, and been repulsed worse than the Turks were at Vienna.

      For my part, I cannot repent the having thrown away a little idle time in so facetious and odd a Conversation, a daily course of this would soon bring a surfeit, but a small touch E&#9679;&#9679;passant, may be as much indulged as a meal of Roots and fruit, when either we want better Dainties, or their constant use hath rendred them unpallatable; and when time is as heavy on my hands as it was when we met, I so little repent the expence of it now, that I may lay out as much more in chewing the Cud, and committing to Paper what we have said. And tho what hath been already Printed, between us and Bays, be indeed as much above this as he is above Stutter, yet this may, perhaps, give as much satisfaction to the Reader, since a
