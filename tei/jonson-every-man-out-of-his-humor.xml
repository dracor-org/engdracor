        <p>I Vnderstand you, Gentlemen, not your houses: and a worthy succession of you, to all time, as being borne the Iudges of these studies. When I wrote this Poeme, I had friendship with diuers in your societies; who, as they were great Names in learning, so they were no lesse Examples of liuing. Of them, and then (that I say no more) it was not despis'd. Now that the Printer, by a doubled charge, thinkes it worthy a longer life, then commonly the ayre of such things doth promise; I am carefull to put it a seruant to their pleasures, who are the inheriters of the first fauour borne it. Yet, I command, it lye not in the way of your more noble, and vse-full studies to the publike. For so I shall suffer for it: But, when the gowne and cap is off, and the Lord of liberty raignes; then, to take it in your hands, perhaps may make some Bencher, tincted with humanity, reade: and not repent him. </p>

        <list>
          <label>ASPER his Character. </label>
          <item>HE is of an ingenious and free spirit, eager and constant in reproofe, without feare controuling the worlds abuses. One, whom no seruile hope of gaine, or frosty apprehension of danger, can make to be a Parasite, either to time, place▪ or opinion. </item>
          <label>MACILENTE. </label>
          <item>A Man well parted, a sufficient Scholler, and trauail'd; who (wanting that place in the worlds account, which he thinks his merit capable of) falls into such an enuious apoplexie, with which his iudgement is so dazeled, and distasted, that he growes violently impatient of any opposite happinesse in another. </item>
          <label>PVNTARVOLO. </label>
          <item>A Vaine glorious Knight, ouer-Englishing his trauels, and wholly consecrated to singularity; the very Iacobs staffe of complement: a Sir, that hath liu'd to see the reuolution of time in most of his apparell. Of presence good ynough, but so palpably affected to his owne praise, that (for want of flatterers) he commends himselfe, to the floutage of his owne family. He deales vpon returnes, and strange performances, resoluing (in despight of publike derision) to sticke to his owne particular fashion, phrase, and gesture. </item>
          <label>CARLO BVFFONE. </label>
          <item>A Publike, scurrilous, and prophane Iester; that (more swift then Circe) with absurd simile's will transforme any person into deformity. A good Feast-hound, or Banket-beagell, that will sent you out a supper some three mile off, and sweare to his Patrons <hi>(Dam him</hi>) hee came in Oares, when hee was but wafted ouer in a Sculler. A slaue, that hath an extraordinary gift in pleasing his palat, <pb n="78" xml:id="ep000092-050-a"/>and will swill vp more sacke at a sitting, then would make all the Guard a posset. His religion is rayling, and his discourse ribaldry. They stand highest in his respect, whom he studies most to reproch. </item>
          <label>FASTIDIVS BRISKE. </label>
          <item>A Neat, spruce, affecting Courtier, one that weares clothes well, and in fashion; practiseth by his glasse how to salute; speakes good remnants (notwithstanding the Base-violl and Tabacco:) sweares tersely, and with variety; cares not what Ladies fauour he belyes, or great Mans familiarity: a good property to perfume the boot of a coach. Hee will borrow another mans borse to praise, and backs him as his owne. Or, for a neede, on foot can post himselfe into credit with his marchant, only with the gingle of his spurre, and the jerke of his wand. </item>
          <label>DELIRO. </label>
          <item>A Good doting Citizen, who (it is thought) might be of the common Councell for his wealth: a fellow sincerely besotted on his owne wife, and so rapt with a conceit of her perfections, that be simply holds himselfe vnworthy of her. And in that hood-winkt humour, liues more like a suter then a husband; standing in as true dread of her displeasure, as when he first made loue to her. He doth sacrifice two-pence in iuniper to her, euery morning, before shee rises, and wakes her, with villanous-out-of-tune musick, which shee out of her contempt (though not out of her iudgement) is sure to dislike. </item>
          <label>FALLACE. </label>
          <item>DEliro's wife, and Idoll: a proud mincing Peat, and as peruerse as he is officious. Shee dotes as perfectly vpon the Courtier, as her husband doth on her, and only wants the face to be dishonest. </item>
          <label>SAVIOLINA. </label>
          <item>A Court Lady, whose weightiest praise is a light wit, admir'd by herselfe, and one more, her seruant Briske. </item>
          <pb n="79" xml:id="ep000092-050-b"/>
          <label>SORDIDO. </label>
          <item>A Wretched hob-nail'd Chuffe, whose recreation, is reading of Almanacks; and felicity, foule, weather. One that neuer pray'd, but for a leane dearth, and euer wept in a fat haruest. </item>
          <label>FVNGOSO. </label>
          <item>THe sonne of Sordido, and a student: one that has reuel'd in his time, and followes the fashion a farre off, like a spie. He makes it the whole bent of his endeuours, to wring sufficient meanes from his wretched father, to put him in the Courtiers cut: at which he earnestly aimes, but so vnluckily, that he still lights short a sute. </item>
          <label>SOGLIARDO. </label>
          <item>AN essentiall Clowne, brother to Sordido, yet so enamour'd of the name of a Gentleman, that he will haue it, though he buyes it. He comes vp euery Terme to learne to take Tabacco, and see new Motions. He is in his kingdome when he can get himselfe into company, where he may be well laught at. </item>
          <label>SHIFT. </label>
          <item>A Thred-bare Sharke. One that neuer was Souldier, yet liues vpon lendings. His profession is skeldring and odling, his banke Poules, and his ware-house Pict-hatch. Takes vp single testons vpon othes, till Doomes day. Falls vnder executions of three shillings, and enters into fiue-groat bonds. He way-layes the reports of seruices, and connes them without booke, damming himselfe he came new from them, when all the while he was taking the dyet in a bawdy house, or lay pawn'd in his chamber for rent, and victuals. He is of that admirable and happy memory, that he will salute one for an old acquaintance, that he neuer saw in his life before. He vsurps vpon cheats, quarrels, and robberies, which he neuer did, only to get him a name. His chiefe exercises are, taking the Whiffe, squiring a Cockatrice, and making priuy searches for Imparters. </item>
          <label>CLOVE, and ORANGE. </label>
          <pb n="80" xml:id="ep000092-051-a"/>
          <item>AN inseparable case of Coxcombs, City-borne; The Gemini or Twins of foppery: that like a paire of woodden soyles, are fit for nothing, but to be practis'd vpon. Being well flatter'd, they'le lend money, and repent when they ha' done. Their glory is to inuite Plaiers, and make suppers. And in company of better ranke (to auoide the suspect of insufficiency) will inforce their ignorance, most desperately, to set vpon the vnderstanding of any thing. Orange is the more humorous of the two (whose small portion of iuyce being squeez'd out) Cloue serues to sticke him, with commendations. </item>
          <label>CORDATVS. </label>
          <item>THe Authors friend; A man inly acquainted with the scope and drift of his Plot: Of a discreet, and vnderstanding iudgement; and has the plase of a Moderator. </item>

            <l>Flowes instantly away, and leaues behind </l>

And (though that in him this kinde of Poeme appeared absolute, and fully perfected) yet how is the face of it chang'd since, in MENANDER, PHILEMON, CECILIVS, PLAVTVS, and the rest; who haue vtterly excluded the Chorus, altered the property of the persons, their names, and natures, and augmented it with all liberty, according to the elegancie and disposition of those times, wherein they wrote?

            <p>Faith, sir, the same that sundred AGAMEMNON, and great THETIS sonne; but let the cause escape, sir: Hee sent mee a challenge (mict with some few braues) which I restor'd, and in fine we met. Now indeed, sir, (I must tell you) he did offer at first very desperately, but without iudgement: for looke you, sir. I cast my selfe into this figure: now he, comes violently on, and withall aduancing his rapier to strike, I thought to haue tooke his arme (for he had left his whole body to my election, and I was sure he could not recouer his guard) Sir, I mist my purpose in his arme, rasht his doublet sleeue, ran him close by the left cheek, and through his haire. He againe, lights me here (I had on, a gold cable hatband, then new come vp, which I wore about a murrey French hat I had) cuts my hatband (and yet it was massie, gold-smithes worke) cuts my brimmes, which by good fortune (being thicke embrodered with gold-twist, and spangles) disappointed the force of the blow: Neuerthelesse, it graz'd on my shoulder, takes me away sixe purles of an Italian cut-worke band I wore (cost me three pound in the exchange, but three daies before.) </p>

Now (vpon the second signe of his assault) I betooke me to the former manner of my defence; he (on the other side) abandon'd his body to the same danger, as before, and followes me still with blowes: But I (being loth to take the deadly aduantage that lay before mee of his left side) made a kind of stramazoun, ranne him vp to the hilts, through the <pb n="149" xml:id="ep000092-086-b"/>doublet, through the shirt, and yet mist the skin. Hee (making a reuerse blow) falls vpon my emboss'd girdle (I had throwne off the hangers a little before) strikes off a skirt of a thick— lac't sattin doublet I had (lin'd with some foure taffataes) cuts off two panes, embrodered with pearle, rends through the drawings out of tissew, enters the linings, and skips the flesh. </p>

                <p>Mary, because wee'le imitate your actors, and be out of our Humours. Besides, here are those (round about you) of more abilitie in censure then wee, whose iudgements can giue it a more satisfying allowance: wee'le refer you to them. </p>

                <p>I? is't e'en so? Wel, gentlemen, I should haue gone in, and return'd to you, as I was ASPER at the first: but (by reason the shift would haue beene somewhat long, and we are loth to draw your patience farder) wee'le intreat you to imagine it. And now (that you may see I will be out of humour for companie) I stand wholly to your kind approbation, and (indeed) am nothing so peremptorie as I was in the beginning: Mary, I will not doe as PLAVTVS, in his Amphytrio, for all this <hi>(Summi Ionis causa, Plaudite:) </hi>begge a Plaudite, for gods sake; but if you (out of the bountie of your good liking) will bestow it; why, you may (in time) make leane MACILENTE as fat, as Sir IOHN FAL-STAFFE. </p>

        <l>NEuer till now did obiect greet mine eyes </l>
        <l>With any light content: but in her graces, </l>
        <l>All my malicious powers haue lost their stings. </l>
        <l>Enuie is fled my soule, at sight of her, </l>
        <l>And shee hath chac'd all black thoughts from my bosome, </l>
        <l>Like as the sunne doth darkenesse from the world. </l>
        <l>My streame of humour is runne out of me. </l>
        <l>And as our cities torrent (bent t'infect </l>
        <l>The hallow'd bowels of the siluer Thames) </l>
        <l>Is checkt by strength, and clearnesse of the riuer, </l>
        <l>Till it hath spent it selfe e'ene at the shore; </l>
        <l>So, in the ample, and vnmeasur'd floud </l>
        <l>Of her perfections, are my passions drown'd: </l>
        <l>And I haue now a spirit as sweet, and cleere, </l>
        <l>As the most rarefi'd and subtile aire. </l>
        <l>With which, and with a heart as pure as fire, </l>
        <l>(Yet humble as the earth) doe I implore, </l>
        <l>O heauen, that shee (whose presence hath effected </l>
        <l>This change in me) may suffer most late change </l>
        <l>In her admir'd and happie gouernement: </l>
        <l>May still this Land be call'd fortunate, </l>
        <l>And rugged treason tremble at the sound </l>
        <l>When Fame shall speake it with an emphasis. </l>
        <l>Let forraine politie be dull as lead, </l>
        <l>And pale inuasion come with halfe a heart, </l>
        <l>When he but lookes vpon her blessed soile. </l>
        <l>The throat of warre be stopt within her land, </l>
        <l>And turtle-footed peace dance fayrie rings </l>
        <l>About her court: where, neuer may there come </l>
        <l>Suspect, or danger, but all trust, and safetie: </l>
        <l>Let flatterie be dumbe, and enuie blind </l>
        <l>In her dread presence: death himselfe admire her: </l>
        <l>And may her vertues make him to forget </l>
        <l>The vse of his ineuitable hand. </l>
        <l>Flie from her age; Sleepe time before her throne, </l>
        <l>Our strongest wall falls downe, when shee is gone. </l>
