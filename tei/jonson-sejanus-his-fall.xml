        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>AELius Seianus, sonne to Seius Strabo, a gentleman of Rome, and borne at Vulsinium, after his long seruice in court: first, vnder Augustus, afterward, Tiberius: grew into that fauour with the latter, and won him by those artes, as there wanted nothing, but the name, to make him a copartner of the Empire. Which greatnesse of his, Drusus, the Emperors sonne not brooking, after many smother'd dislikes, it one day breaking out, the Prince strooke him publikely on the face. To reuenge which disgrace, Liuia, the wife of Drusus (being before corrupted by him to her dishonour, and the discouery of her husbands councells) Seianus practiseth with, together with her Physitian, called Eudemus, and one, an Eunuch, to poyson Drusus. This their inhumane act hauing successefull, and vnsuspected passage, it emboldeneth Seianus to farther, &amp; more insolent proiects, euen the ambition of the Empire: where finding the lets, he must encounter, to be many, &amp; hard, in respect of the issue of Germanicus (who were next in hope for the succession) he deuiseth to make Tiberius selfe, his meanes: &amp; instill's into his eares many doubts, and suspicions, both against the Princes, and their mother Agrippina: which Caesar iealously hearkning to, as couetously consenteth to their ruine, and their friends. In this time, the better to mature and strengthen his designe, he labours to marry Liuia, and worketh (with all his ingine) to remoue Tiberius from the knowledge of publike businesse, with allurements of a quiet and retyred life: the latter of which, Tiberius (out of a pronenesse to lust, and a desire to hide those vnnaturall pleasures, which he could not so publikely practise) embraceth: the former inkindleth his feares, and there giues him first cause of doubt, or suspect toward Seianus. Against whom, he raiseth (in priuate) a new instrument, one Sertorius Macro, and by him vnder-worketh, discouers the others counsells, his meanes, his ends, sounds the affections of the Senators, diuides, distracts them: at last, when Seianus least looketh, and is most secure (with pretext of doing him an vn-wonted honour in the Senate) he traines him from his guardes, with one letter, and in one day, hath him suspected, accused, condemned, and torne in pieces, by the rage of the people, </p>
