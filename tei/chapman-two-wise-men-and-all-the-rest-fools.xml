        <p>RIGHT noble and worthy Assembly: It hath beene a very auncient and laudable custome, in the best gouerned common-wealthes, to admit and fauourably to allow interludes and discourses vpon the Stage for diuers reasons; but especially two. The one, to entertaine the welconditioned people with some delightfull and fruitfull conceits, thereby as it were to deceiue idlenes of that time which it had allotted for worse purposes. The other, for the iust reprehension of such as with serious and more graue aduisings cannot or will not be so freely admonished and corrected. The later of these two respects hath begotten this Dialogue, ready to be acted, principally and specially pointing that Impe which is infortunately fostered vp to this day, to ruine it selfe with infamy. Onely this comfort is afforded, that if he be present, and withall silent, he may suppose that of all others it concernes not him. If hee be absent (as most likely he is) then euery other that findes himselfe parcell guilt may see the deformity, and forbeare the excesse. Other touches and passages are, which our Author and wee present not with minde to offend any, but to please the weldisposed. And so in the name of all the rest I entreate courteous audience, and pardon of all faults. </p>

          <p>HOw much wee that haue beene trauailers differ from other kindes of people? So soone as we arriue, we are attended to the Burse or Randevou of Merchants. There we walke as if the whole world hath neede to be informed, yea and directed by vs in matters of greatest moment; such as is trafficke and commerce with forraine nations, and the state and disposition of those kingdomes through which we haue passed. For it may be we can giue intelligence of preparations and invasions. We can demonstrate their strength and munition. We can number their Captaines and Generals. We can discouer their designes and confederates. And finally, we can lay plots to crosse and make voide all their purposes, and stratagems, which these home-bred and countrie spunne people can neuer attaine vnto. Therefore by good right we are had in esteeme, and speciall request, and courteously receiued of Councellors of state wheresoeuer we come. Neither doe we tye our selues to any one dominion more then another, but indifferently to all states we deliuer freely the condition of euery nation. And the place we fall into is our best beloued so long as there we tarry, and <pb xml:id="ep000341-004-a"/>not a minute longer. We oblige our selues to no Prince for gold nor gaine, nor be pensioners to any Monarche: but with desire to see more we passe through all gouernements, vnchecked and vncontrolled, because we take part with none, offend, none, nor are false to any. And this life wee loue aboue all liues, not content with any life, but that which seekes an other life. </p>

Now Hortano take all the hearbs of thy garden &amp; stil their water to powder, thou canst never wash out the strength of this argomen. I make it iust as they did theirs at Cambridge about my nag. I remember the words, and shall doe as long as my nag liues. For one of them spouted thus. Every horse hath <pb n="25" xml:id="ep000341-015-b"/>stones: but this beast hath no stones; Ergo he is no horse. And I clapt him on the backe and told him that hee spake truth. For I gelt him the last yeare, and eat his stones to my breakfast. But I had like to haue mar'd all by saying so. For there was a nimble-headed Scholler that stood by, (and yet had nothing to doe with the question) went about to proue me a horse, and thus he began. Euery liuing beast, or Animal, that hath in him horse stones, is a horse. But this Animal, (meaning me) hath horse stones in him, Ergo he is a horse. I was striken in such a maze (knowing that I did eate the horse stones) that I was like to sinke where I stood, and euen presently to congeale into a horse. But there was by chance an honest Scholler by, who saw my colour quite gone, took pity on me, and bade me be of good cheere, I shood not be a horse. And told the tother to his face, that there was a flacy in his argumen. And then fetcht him about with a Recumbentibus, and prou'd that the horse stones which I had eaten, were consum'd, and became such stuffe as I cannot tel you without Sir reuerence of your teeth; and that they did not grow in me as they doe in horses: Ergo the case was alter'd. Then vpon this point of growing, and not growing, there was such a sturre, that all the horse-coursers in the Faire came about vs. One said they did grow, another denyed it, and such part taking on both sides, that in the end I was content (being desirous to make them friends) to bee search't in the open market, and so was cleer'd before them all to haue no more stones then I shood haue. And glad was I that I was not a horse. Had not I (thinke you good cause to remember Logicke? Yes, I shall neuer forget it if I should liue 100 yeares. </p>

            <p>Your question is not hard to decide, &amp; fit enough for me to deliuer mine opinion in. It is true, they were all working daies at the first. For which purpose it is said, such work as thou doest, worke it in those six daies, and not on the seauenth day. Yet God did neuer forbid any of those six daies to be kept holy. And the Christian Church hath appointed many daies to be kept holy in memory of Saints which suffered diverse torments for Christs sake, who suffered all for them, and for them all. And those to be kept to the worlds end, that their facts and fame might neuer die, but encourage others to treade their bloudie but Heauenly steppes. <pb xml:id="ep000341-017-a"/>Therefore since the Church of God and custome of Christian countries haue so ordered it, let no mans private rashnes presume such alteration, as to make away or put out the Holy-dayes, but with due reverence to obserue them. </p>

          <p>Of all the musicke in the world there is none like to that which is found in hauking. For, the questing of Spaniels, the spring of partridges, the gingling of Haukes bels, and thundring of horse heeles is the best consort, and pleaseth me aboue all delights. </p>

            <p>Your Comparison is too generall. Had you excepted hunting I might haue join'd hands with you against all others, but now I am become your adversary. For it is confessed of all sorts, that the musicke in hunting, both for continuance of the sport. for a delightfull exercise contenting the eare, and gentle-men-like pastime the world cannot compare with vs, and so we hunters cary the Bell away. </p>

            <p>Indeed you hunter carie the Bell, but not for any good doing, no more then you doe by carying the horne to very mans house. What time and order your hounds obserue with their naturall harmonie, I will not dispute (they and their keepers being seldome in order) but of this I am sure, that there are few kennells of hounds in England, but while some are in chase after Hare, or Fox, others are killing sheep in full crie of the poore harmelesse beast: wherevpon is growne that proverbe. The Fox kills the lambs, and the hounds the old sheep. But I cannot indure you should challenge hunting to suit better with a gentleman then hauking. Everie Clowne can keepe a dog, and the more carion he eateth the more egregiouslie he smelleth: but the hauke adorneth a kings fist, besides the admirable conquest the faulkner maketh in a haukes nature, bringing the wild Haggard hauing all the earth &amp; seas to scowre over vncontrollable, to attend and obeie her keeper so, that at his verie voice she <pb xml:id="ep000341-020-a"/>turnes towards and stoupes to his gloue. Hounds are so prejudiciall to the common-wealth, that I dare vndertake to proue, that (next vnto drunkards) they are the greatest spoilers of poore mens bread. </p>

            <p>The Lawyer is a necessary member of the commonwelth to finde and determine everie mans right. But if willingly he oppugne right, and be enemie to peace, he is the Diuels agent, and Christs enemie. </p>

            <p>There are yet two other things obiected, but both of our nature therefore though it were a huddle, it makes but a single game. One was this that you picked the first letter out of a truncke ful of linnen, (the letter for the surname seruing your name as well as the owners you let stand) and put on A. insteed of R. which was picked out. And this was Mr. Rellips linnen. The other was that you marked pillowes, and other stuffe of a noble mans with your own marke, and vsed them as your owne. I forgot the noble mans name but it sounds like a port towne toward the sunne when it is at the highest. They had much of their stuffe againe, but some stucke in your fingers.

You see I was content (though much against my minde) that you should haue kept your vow of virginitie, (if so had stood your resolution) now I appeale to your owne court for Iustice, and hope you will giue as good way to the fulfilling of my vow, which is never to leaue your service and companie. </p>

Among the severall discourses this day acted. I note many vices vailed over with froth, and florish of words, but the same againe vnmasked with substantiall matter, and laid naked to disgrace. So it seemeth they are not propounded to imitate, but set forth to be shamed. They are painted in colours but in a map of mischiefe: they haue some patrons and followers, but such as runne to ruine. They are brought forth to be rewed; but to manifest their vglinesse. They come not here to be liked, but lothed; not to be fauored, but derided. Not allowed in private, but in publike to be condemned. So I hope that all wise hearers will avoid the sinnes and abuses here touched (which are many) and follow good counsell if they heard any.

        <p>NOw that your patience hath permitted vs to bring vnto an end this present Dialogue, wee stand in good hope of your clemencie, that no more offence will bee taken at any word or action passed then we had meaning to giue, which wee protest was none at all. For it were against reason and our owne ends to driue hence that companie, which we wish rather doubled, then out of it one to be spared. It resteth that we render you very humble and hartie thanks. And that all our hearts pray for the King,  and his families enduring happinesse, and our countries perpetuall welfare. Si placet plaudite. </p>
