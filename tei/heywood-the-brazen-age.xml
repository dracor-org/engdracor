        <p>THough a third brother should not inherite, whilst the two elder liue, by the laws of the Land, &amp; therfore it might breed in mee a discoragement, to commit him without any hereditary means, to shift for it selfe in a world so detractiue &amp; calumnious, yet rather presuming vpon the ingenious, then affraid of the enuious, I haue expos'd him to the fortunes of a yonger brother, which is, most commonly, brauely to liue, or desperately to hazard: yet this is my comfort, that what imperfection soever it haue, hauing a brazen face it cannot blush; much like a Pedant about this Towne, who, when all trades fail'd, turn'd Pedagogue, &amp; once insinuating with me, borrowed from me certaine Translations of Ouid, as his three books De Arte Amandi, &amp; two De Remedio Amoris, which since, his most brazen face hath most impudently challenged as his own, wherefore, I must needs proclaime it as far as Ham, where he now keeps schoole, Hos ego versiculos feci tulit alter honores, they were things which out of my iuniority and want of indgement, I committed to the veiw of some priuate friends, but with no purpose of publishing, or further communicating them. Therfore I wold entreate that Austin, for so his name is, to acknowledge his wrong to me in shewing them, &amp; his owne impudence, &amp; ignorance in challenging them. But courteous Reader, I can onely excuse him in this, that this is the Brazen Age. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
