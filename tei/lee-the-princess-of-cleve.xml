        <head>TO THE Right Honourable Charles Earl of Dorset and Middlesex, Lord Chamberlain of His Majesties Houshold, and one of His Majesties most Honourable Privy-Council, &amp;c. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>May it please your Lordship, </salute>

        <p>THis Play, when it was Acted, in the Character of the Princess of Iainville, had a resemblance of Marguerite in the Massacre of Paris, Sister to Charles the Ninth, and Wife to Henry the Fourth King of Navar: That fatal Marriage which cost the Blood of so many Thousand Men, and the Lives of the best Commanders. What was borrowed in the Action is left out in the Print, and quite obliterated in the minds of Men. But the Duke of Guise, who was Notorious for a bolder Fault, has wrested two whole Scenes from the Original, which after the Vacation he will be forc'd to pay. I was, I confess, through Indignation, forc'd to limb my own Child, which Time, the true Cure for all Maladies, and Injustice has set together again. The Play cost me much pains, the Story is true, and I hope the Object will display Treachery in its own Colours. But this Farce, Comedy, Tragedy or meer Play, was a Revenge for the Refusal of the other; for when they expected <pb xml:id="ep000623-003-a"/>the most polish'd Hero in Nemours, I gave 'em a Ruffian reeking from Whetstone's- Park. The fourth and fifth Acts of the Chances, where <hi>Don Iohn </hi>is pulling down; Marriage Alamode, where they are bare to the Waste; the Libertine, and Epsom-Wells, are but Copies of his Villany. He lays about him like the Gladiator in the Park; they may walk by, and take no notice. I beg your Lordship to excuse this account, for indeed 'tis all to introduce the Massacre of Paris to your Favour, and approve it to be play'd in its first Figure. </p>

        <head>THE PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>TRust was the Glory of the foremost Age, </l>
        <l>When Truth and Love with Friendship did engage; </l>
        <l>When Man to Man cou'd walk with Arms entwin'd, </l>
        <l>And vent their Griefs in spaces of the Wind; </l>
        <l>Express their minds, and speak their thoughts as clear, </l>
        <l>As Eastern Mornings op'ning to the year. </l>
        <l>But since that Law and Treachery came in, </l>
        <l>And open Honesty was made a Sin, </l>
        <l>Men wait for Men as Dogs for Foxes prey, </l>
        <l>And Women wait the closing of the day. </l>
        <l>There's scarce a man that ventures to be good, </l>
        <l>For Truth by Knaves was never understood; </l>
        <l>For there's the Curse, when Vice o'er Vertue rules, </l>
        <l>That all the World are Knaves or downright Fools. </l>
        <l>So they may make advantage of th' Allay, </l>
        <l>They'll take the Dross and through the Gold away. </l>
        <l>Women turn Vsurers with their own affright, </l>
        <l>And Want's the Hag that rides 'em all the night. </l>
        <l>The little Mob, the City Wastcoateer, </l>
        <l>Will pinch the Back to make the Buttock bare, </l>
        <l>And drain the last poor Guinea from her Dear. </l>
        <l>Thus Times are turn'd upon a private end, </l>
        <l>There's scarce a Man that's generous to his Friend. </l>
        <l>But there's a Monarch on a Throne sublime, </l>
        <l>That makes Truth Law, and gives the Poets Rhime; </l>
        <l>Be his the bus'ness of our little Fates, </l>
        <l>Our mean Contentions, and their high Debates. </l>
        <l>By Sea and Land our most Imperial Lord, </l>
        <l>With all the Praises Blest that Hearts afford, </l>
        <l>With Lawrels Crown'd, unconquer'd by the Sword: </l>
        <l>William the Sovereign of our whole Affairs, </l>
        <l>Our Guide in Peace, and Council in the Wars. </l>
