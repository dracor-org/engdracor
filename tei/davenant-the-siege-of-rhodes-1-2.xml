            <head>To the Reader. </head>
            <p>I May receive disadvantage by this Address design'd for excuses; for it will too hastily put you in mind that errors are not far off when excuses are at hand; this refers to our Representation: and some may be willing to be led to find the blemishes of it; but would be left to their own conduct to discover the beauties, if there be any. Yet I may forewarn you that the defects which I intend to excuse are chiefly such, as you cannot reform but only with your Purse; that is, by building us a larger Room; a design which we began and shall not be left for you to finish, because we have observ'd that many who are liberal of their understanding when they would issue it out towards discovery of imperfections, have not alwayes Money to expend in things necessary towards the making up of perfection. </p>
            <p>It has been often wisht that our Scenes (we having oblig'd our selves to the variety of Five changes, according to the Ancient Drammatick distinctions made for time) had not been <pb xml:id="ep000557-003-a"/>confin'd to eleven foot in height, and about fifteen in depth, including the places of passage reserv'd for the Musick. This is so narrow an allowance for the Fleet of Solyman the Magnicent, his Army, the Island of Rhodes, and the varieties attending the Siege of the City; that I fear you will think, we invite you to such a contracted Trifle as that of the Caesars carv'd upon a Nut. </p>
            <p>As these Limits have hinder'd the splendor of our Scene, so we are like to give no great satisfaction in the quantity of our Argument, which is in story very copious; but shrinks to a small narration here, because we could not convey it by more then seven Persons; being constrain'd to prevent the length of Recitative Musick, as well as to conserve, without incumbrance, the narrowness of the place. Therefore you cannot expect the chief Ornaments belonging to a History Drammatically digested into Turns and Counter-turns, to double Walks, and interweavings of design. </p>
            <p>This is exprest to forbid your excess of expectation; but we must take care not to deterr you from the hope of some satisfaction; for that <pb xml:id="ep000557-003-b"/>were, not only to hang out no Bush, but likewise to shut up our Doors. Therefore, as you have heard what kind of excellencies you should not expect: So I will in brief (I hope without vanity) give you encouragement, by telling you, there are some things at least excusable which you may resolve to meet. </p>
            <p>We conceive, it will not be unacceptable to you if we recompence the narrowness of the Room, by containing in it so much as could be conveniently accomplisht by Art and Industry: which wil not be doubted in the Scenes by those who can judg that kind of Illustration &amp; know the excellency of Mr. <hi>John Web</hi>, who design'd and order'd it. The Musick was compos'd, and both the Vocal and Instrumental is exercis'd by the most transcendent of England in that Art, &amp; perhaps not unequal to the best masters abroad; but being Recitative, and therefore unpractis'd here; though of great reputation amongst other Nations, the very attempt of it is an obligation to our own. The Story represented (which will not require much apology because it expects but little praise) is Heroical, and not withstanding the continual hurry and busie agitations <pb xml:id="ep000557-004-a"/>of a hot Siege, is (I hope) intelligibly convey'd to advance the Characters of Vertue in the shapes of Valour and conjugal Love. And though the main Argument hath but a single Walk, yet perhaps the movings of it will not seem unpleasant. You may inquire, being a Reader, why in an heroick Argument my numbers are so often diversify'd and fall into short fractions; considering that a continuation of the usual length of English verse would appear more Heroical in reading. But when you are an Auditor you will finde that in this, I rather deserve approbation then need excuse; for frequent alterations of measure (which cannot be so unpleasant to him that reads as troublesome to him that writes) are necessary to Recitative Musick for variation of Ayres. If what I have said, be taken for excuses, I have my intent; because excuses are not always signs of Error, but are often modest explanations▪ of things that might otherwise be mistaken. But I have said so much to vindicate my self from having occasion to be excus'd for the Poem, that it brings me at last to ask pardon for the length of the Epistle. </p>

            <p>THe Ornament which encompass'd the Scene, consisted of several Columns, of gross Rustick work; which bore up a large Freese. In the middle of the Freese was a Compartiment, wherein was written RHODES. The Compartiment was supported by divers Habiliments of War; intermix'd with the Military Ensignes of those several Nations who were famous for defence of that Island; which were the <hi>French, Germans</hi>, and Spaniards, the <hi>Italians, Avergnois</hi>, and English: The Renown of the English valour made the Grand Master Villerius, to select their Station to be most frequently commanded by himself. The principal enrichment of the <pb n="2" xml:id="ep000557-006-a"/>Freese was a Crimson Drapery, whereon severall Trophies of Arms were fixt, Those on the Right hand, representing such as are chiefly in use amongst the Western Nations; together with the proper cognisance of the Order of the Rhodian Knights; and on the left, such as are most esteem'd in the Eastern Countries; and on an Antique Shield the Crescent of the Ottomans. </p>

In that part <pb n="3" xml:id="ep000557-006-b"/>of the Horizon, terminated by the Sea, was represented the Turkish Fleet making towards a Promontory some few miles distant from the Town. </p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE the EARL of CLARENDON Lord High Chancellor of England, &amp;c. </head>
            <opener>
              <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THough Poems have lost much of their Antient value, yet I will presume to make this a Present to your Lordship; and the rather, because Poems (if they have any thing precious in them) do, like Jewels, attract a greater esteem when they come into the possession of great Persons, than when they are in ordinary hands. </p>
            <p>The excuse which men have had for dedication of Books, has been to protect them from the malice of Readers: but a defence of of this nature was fitter for your forces when you were early known to Learned men (and had no other occasion for your abilities, but to vindicate Authors) than at this Season <pb xml:id="ep000557-027-a"/>when you are of extraordinary use to the whole Nation. </p>
            <p>Yet when I consider how many &amp; how violent they are who persecute Dramatick Poetry, I will then rather call this a Dedication than a Present; as not intending by it to pass any kind of obligation, but to receive a great benefit; since I cannot be safe unless I am shelter'd behind your Lordship. </p>
            <p>Your name is so eminent in the Justice which yon convey through all the different Members of this great Empire, that my Rhodians seem to enjoy a better Harbour in the Pacifique Thames, than they had on the Mediterranean; and I have brought Solyman to be arraign'd at your Tribunal, where you are the Censor of his civility &amp; magnificence. </p>
            <p>Dramatick Poetry meets with the same persecution now, from such who esteem themselves the most refin'd and civil, as it ever did from the Barbarous. And yet whilst those vertuous Enemies deny <hi>heroique Plays </hi>to the Gentry, they entertain the People with a Seditious Farce of their own counterfeit Gravity. But I hope you will not be unwilling to receive (in this Poetical <pb xml:id="ep000557-027-b"/>dress) neither the Besieg'd nor the Besiegers, since they come without their vices: for as others have purg'd the Stage from corruptions of the Art of the Drama, so I have endeavour'd to cleanse it from the corruption of manners; nor have I wanted care to render the Ideas of Greatness and Vertue pleasing and familiar. </p>
            <p>In old Rome the Magistrates did not only protect but exhibit Plaies; and, not long since, the two wise Cardinals did kindly entertain the great Images represented in Tragedy by <hi>Monsieur Corneille</hi>. My Lord, it proceeds from the same mind not to be pleas'd with Princes on the Stage, and not to affect them in the Throne; for those are ever most inclin'd to break the Mirrour who are unwilling to see the Images of such as have just authority over their guilt. </p>
            <p>In this Poem I have reviv'd the remembrance of that fatal desolation which was permitted by Christian Princes when they favour'd the ambition of such as defended the diversity of Religions (begot by the factions of Learning) in Germany; whilst those who would never admit Learning into their Empire <pb xml:id="ep000557-028-a"/>(lest it should meddle with Religion and intangle it with Controversy) did make Rhodes defenceless; which was the only fortify'd Academy in Christendome where Divinity and Arms were equally profess'd. I have likewise, for variety, softened the Martial encounters between Solyman and the Rhodians, with intermingling the conjugal vertues of Alphonso and Ianthe. </p>
            <p>If I should proceed, and tell your Lordship of what use Theatres have antiently been, and may be now, by heightening the Characters of Valour, Temperance, Natural Juststice, and complacency to Government, I should fall into the ill manners and indiscretion of ordinary Dedicators, who go about to instruct those from whose abilities they expect protection. The apprehension of this error makes me hasten to crave pardon for what has been already said by </p>

              <l>WHat if we serve you now a Trick? and do </l>
              <l>Like him who posted Bills that he would show </l>
              <l>So many active feats, and those so high, </l>
              <l>That Court and City came to see him fly? </l>
              <l>But he, good man, carefull to empty still </l>
              <l>The Money-Boxes, as the House did fill, </l>
              <l>Of all his Tricks, had time to shew but one: </l>
              <l>He lin'd his Purse, and, Presto! he was gone!— </l>
              <l>Many were then as fond, as you are now, </l>
              <l>Of seeing stranger things than Art can show. </l>
              <l>We may perform as much as he did doe; </l>
              <l>We have your Money, and a Back-Door too. </l>
              <l>Go, and be couzen'd thus, rather than stay </l>
              <l>And wait to be worse couzen'd with our Play. </l>
              <l>For you shall hear such course complaints of Love, </l>
              <l>Such silly sighing, as no more will move </l>
              <l>Your Passion then Dutch Madrigals can doe, </l>
              <l>When Skippers, with wit Beards, at Wapping wooe. </l>
              <l>Hope little from our Poets wither'd Witt; </l>
              <l>From Infant-Players, scarce grown Puppets yet. </l>
              <l>Hope from our Women less, whose bashfull fear, </l>
              <l>Wondred to see me dare to enter here: </l>
              <l>Each took her leave, and wisht my danger past; </l>
              <l>And though I come back safe, and undisgrac'd, </l>
              <l>Yet when they spye the WITS here then I doubt </l>
              <l>No Amazon can make 'em venture out. </l>
              <l>Though I advis'd 'em not to fear you much; </l>
              <l>For I presume not half of you are such. </l>
              <l>But many Trav'lers here as Judges come; </l>
              <l>From <hi>Paris, Florence, Venice</hi>, and from Rome: </l>
              <pb xml:id="ep000557-030-a"/>
              <l>Who will describe, when any Scene we draw, </l>
              <l>By each of ours, all that they ever Saw. </l>
              <l>Those praising, for extensive breadth and height; </l>
              <l>And inward distance to deceive the sight. </l>
              <l>When greater Objects, moving in broad Space, </l>
              <l>You rank with lesser, in this narrow Place, </l>
              <l>Then we like Chess-men, on a Chess-board are, </l>
              <l>And seem to play like Pawns the Rhodian Warr. </l>
              <l>Oh Money! Money! if the WITTS would dress, </l>
              <l>With Ornaments, the present face of Peace; </l>
              <l>And to our Poet half that Treasure spare, </l>
              <l>Which Faction gets from Fools to nourish Warr; </l>
              <l>Then his contracted Scenes should wider be, </l>
              <l>And move by greater Engines, till you see </l>
              <l>(Whilst you Securely sit) fierce Armies meet, </l>
              <l>And raging Seas disperse a fighting Fleet. </l>
              <l>Thus much he bad me say; and I confess </l>
              <l>I think he would, if rich, mean nothing less; </l>
              <l>But, leaving you your selves to entertain, </l>
              <l>Like an old Rat retire to Parmazan. </l>

              <l>THough, bashfully, we fear to give offence; </l>
              <l>Yet, pray allow our Poet confidence. </l>
              <l>He has the priv'lege of old Servants got; </l>
              <l>Who are conniv'd at, and have leave to Doat; </l>
              <l>To boast past service, and be chol'rique too, </l>
              <l>Till they believe at last that all they do </l>
              <l>Does far above their Masters Judgments grow: </l>
              <l>Much like to theirs, is his presumption now. </l>
              <l>For free, assur'd, and bold his Brow appears, </l>
              <l>Because, he serv'd your Fathers many years. </l>
              <l>He says he pleas'd them too, but he may find, </l>
              <l>You Wits; not of your Duller-Fathers mind. </l>
              <l>Which, well consider'd Mistress Muse will then </l>
              <l>Wish for her old Gallants at Fri'rs agen; </l>
              <pb xml:id="ep000557-061-b"/>
              <l>Rather than be by those neglected here, </l>
              <l>Whose Fathers civilly did Court her there. </l>
              <l>But as old Mistresses, who meet disdain, </l>
              <l>Forbear through Pride, or Prudence, to complain; </l>
              <l>And satisfie their hearts, when they are sad, </l>
              <l>With thoughts of former Lovers they have had: </l>
              <l>Even so poor Madam-Muse this night must bear, </l>
              <l>With equal pulse, the fits of hope and fear; </l>
              <l>And never will against your Passion strive: </l>
              <l>But, being old, and therefore Narrative, </l>
              <l>Comfort her self with telling Tales, too long, </l>
              <l>Of many Plaudits had when she was young. </l>
