          <l>IT was when Industry did sleepe </l>

        <head>TO HIS MOST WORTHIE FRIEND Mr. FRANCIS HIDE PROCTOR OF OXFORD. </head>
        <p>HAuing resolued what to print, I could not be long doubtfull vnto whom: it had beene an vnfriendly absurdity not to haue intitled him to my second, who might not vniustly haue challenged the patronage of my first Labour. But if vntill this time I had had no reason for such a dedication, if the same most fruitfull Colledge had not for these many years knowne vs of the same time and friendship, if in all offices of life I had not still found you most inseparably one with mee: yet this Worke at this time could not offer it selfe to any so iustly as to you. It is to your name that I owe what euer fruits of my spent time shall be preserued, it is to your name that I owe whateuer fruits of my former time, being vnhappily lost, may haue a possibilitie of recouery. And could I dedicate any of my remaining Labours with <pb xml:id="ep000036-006-a"/>more iustice vnto any, then to him, by whose friendly care, I dare almost assure my selfe of them which are remaining? But some perhaps may say for this, that it had beene better if it had beene lost, or at least that these kind of Labours are more iudiciously supprest then published. Sermons had beene fitter for my setting forth, and to preach more proper then to write. But is not this to preach? I haue heard diuers speake an houre, who preach not, and there are many, who effectually preach, that are more sparing of their breath. If I make the ambitious see that he climbes but to a fall, the vsurper to acknowledge, that blood is but a slippery foundation of power, all men in generall to confesse that the most glorious is not the most safe place: is not this to cry downe Ambition and Vsurpation? or is it lesse to shew, then to threaten? and are not men so much moued with the euent it selfe, as with the commination of the euent? And yet in this age, wherein only Heresie or Sedition preferre a Booke, wherein Contradiction is called Learning, and Zeale wonders that she is become Faction, I can expect but a few Readers, whose small number shall be no discouragement at all to me if that your iudgement shall counterpoise them, which is the onely desired crowne of </p>

        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>LOdovicke Sforza, after hee had cunningly supplanted the Duchesse from the wardship of her sonne Galeazzo, as cunningly practizeth to bee the murtherer of him, of whom he would seeme to be the Protector. To this end he was to remoue this impediment. Isabella daughter to the Prince of Calabria, and Grand-childe vnto Ferdinand King of Naples, was wife to Galeazzo. A woman of a spirit as high as her birth, and equall to Sforza in all things but the sex: shee perceiuing the stupidity of her husband, and how that whatsoeuer she proiected for his safety, he discouered to his vncle, for his ouerthrow, makes her father secretly acquainted with all the passages, desiring him to vindicate his son in law from the vsurpation of his Protector. This could not be so priuately dispatched, but that Sforza had an incling of it, whether out of his owne reach hee guessed it: or by his Nephewes sottishnesse he vnderstood it. To preuent then his owne ruine, whilst he intends his Nephews, he ventures on those remedies which the height of feare rather rusheth on, then chuseth, <pb xml:id="ep000036-007-a"/>which more expresse and exchange, then remoue, or auoyd a danger. He knew the French claime to Naples, to the prosecution of which he sollicites the yong King; whom either his right, or inconsideratenesse quickly armes vnto the action. But before his comming, hee by continuall messengers deludes the old King, and makes him beleeue that there was no purpose of his comming, and that the French iourney vnto Naples, as it was onely the childe of rumor, &amp; had no being but from fame, so in a very short space, in the age of a wonder it would vanish and expire. Thus was Ferdinand perswaded from his necessary defence, till hauing certainly vnderstood that all defence would be too late, the French being already very strong vpon his frontires, cheated, not conquer'd, hee dyes and leaues his sonne Alphonso heire of his kingdome, and his troubles. The French King being now entred in person into Italy, Galeazzo dyes of a poyson at Pauia, when Sforza has brought this worse poyson into his Country. But the French growing prodigiously victorious, and almost by the very seeing ouer comming their opposites, Sforza begins to be apprehensiue of his owne danger, and striues to rid himselfe of these incumbrances, in the which a too much prouidence had intangled him. A consideration <pb xml:id="ep000036-007-b"/>without doubt necessary, but almost past the season, it being neer vnto an impossibility to expell him now, whom it was far from any difficulty at the first not to admit. So that this second resolution did onely proclaime the folly of the first, which either in wisdome hee should not haue ventur'd on, or, in honesty not haue altred. But howsoeuer, hee enters into a new league with the Venetians, and giues the French after their victorious returne from Naples halfe an ouerthrow at Taro. And now when hee thinks himselfe confirm'd in his Dukedome, when he as little fear'd ruine, as he deseru'd preseruation; the French King dyes suddenly, to whom Lewis, the true Duke of Orleans, and titular Duke of Millan, succeeded, with him Sforzaes late friend, the Venetians conclude a league. Thus Sforza being left alone, raiseth two armies vnder the conduct of the two Sanseuerins, men, whom hee had highly fauour'd and aduanced. But it is scarce seene, that a faithlesse Master should haue a trusty seruant, and hee that hath no respect to his owne word, shall in the extremest of his necessities, finde all others promises but words. The elder reuolts, and the yonger, without the least show of resistance, flyes, and Sforza himselfe is so closely pursued, that he can scarce get away safe into Germany. The French <pb xml:id="ep000036-008-a"/>abusing their late victory, the Millanesi with a generall consent, recall Sforza; who, like a melting snow, ouerflowes all before him, and recouers most of his Duchy, with the same easinesse that he had lost it. The strength of his Army consisted especially of Swizzers, whom the late ouerthrow of the warlike Duke of Burgundy, and these Italian wars, had raised to the height of admiration. But to be valiant is not to haue all vertues: these were as strong in treachery, as in battle, they lead Sforza in the habite of a Swizzer into the French camp, through which in the same habit they had promised to conduct him. Thus hauing beene twice betrayd, and now a prisoner, after a ten yeers harsh confining hee dyes in France, hauing liu'd in his misery, longer then in his Duchy, and leauing instruction to succeeding Princes that height should not be their ayme, but integrity; and that they would not (that I may vse the words of our Poet) tempt their starres beyond their light. </p>

          <l>Made the mouth, for being nigh, </l>

          <l>Would you all be Kings, poore men! </l>
          <l>Wish, what you would wish agen, </l>
          <l>Which within your thoughts dares bide, </l>
          <l>And's not fearfull to be try'd. </l>
          <l>What's a King, consider well, </l>
          <l>But the publike Sentinell? </l>
          <l>But a Beacon, which we find </l>

          <l>Whence your fall may gaine a weight, </l>
          <l>Would you all be Kings? you may, </l>
          <l>Euery man hath regall sway, </l>
          <l>And 'tis this the fault does beare, </l>
          <l>Not that he commands, but where </l>

          <l>Haue thy worst acts magnifi'd? </l>
          <l>Does Ambition make thee flee </l>
          <l>To forbidden Sou'raignty. </l>
          <l>Know it is a brauer way </l>
          <l>To forbid, then to obey: </l>
          <l>Know it is a nobler deed, </l>
          <l>To giue ouer, then to speed. </l>
          <l>Were this all? would euery one </l>
          <l>But command himselfe alone, </l>
          <l>But command his owne desire, </l>

          <l>It would not be a griefe to see </l>
          <l>An vniuersall Monarchy. </l>
