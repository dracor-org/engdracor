          <salute>May it please your Grace, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THis Comedy was Written by the Sacred Command of our late most Excellent King, of ever blessed and beloved Memory. I had the great good Fortune to please Him often at His Court in my Masque, on the Stage of Tragedies and Comedies, and so to advance my self in His good opinion; an Honour may render a wiser Man than I vain; for I believe he had more equals in extent of Dominions than of Understanding. The greatest pleasure he had from the Stage was in Comedy, and he often Commanded me to Write it, and lately gave me a Spanish Play called <hi>No Puedeser: Or, It cannot Be. </hi>out of which I took part o' the Name, and design o' this. I received the Employment as a great Honour, because it was difficult; requiring no ordinary skill and pains to build a little Shallop, sit only for the Spanish South Seas, into an English Ship Royal; but I believe my self able for the Work, because he thought so, who understood me and all Men, better than I only knew my self, encourag'd by Royal judgment that never was mistaken, I have attained a success I never should have met with, had I only followed my own feeble Genius, which often deceives me. That I may enjoy the little fortune I have got with the better reputation, and not ramble the World like a blind Author, observing none but my self, I make this humble Application to your Grace. I am sure all the World will approve my choice. I cannot be guilty of Flattery if I would; nor slander Wit (if I had any) by fulsome and wanton Paintings. Here will be no Tryal of skill how I can praise, Nature has done it to my Hands, and devis'd and expos'd finer Ideas, than I am able to Translate. A gracefulness of Person, excellence of Understanding, largeness of Heart, a Loyalty, Gallantry, Integrity, Humility, and many Qualities above my description. Fortune also has been more wise than usual, She frequently honours and enriches others to her own disgrace— but here She shares in the Praise, and Commends her own Wisdome, in what She bestows on your Grace. She has advanc'd Honour in Advancing you, Titles, Greatness and Command may be proved, they have attained you. Wealth has a value in your Hands, 'Tis no vile pardon, poor flatterer, servile Lacquey, wretched Prisoner; but excellent Minister of a just wise and liberal Prince. Shou'd I mention all the Qualities, that have long gained you the highest Honours from Prince and People, I should rather seem to describe a Province than a Man; for what single Province can afford what are at once in your Grace, a General, a Statesman, Courtier, and all in perfection; and which is rare in such company, a Martyr. What has your Grace both done and suffered, for our Religion, Laws, Liberties and Honour? And not only in the former times of Rebellion, but the latter of Confusion? When the pretended Protestants of the times, out of their Zeal against all Popish Doctrines, abhorring you for adhering to good Works. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000510-003-a"/>
        <p>As an English-man, I am bound in justice, to pay you all the Honours I can. You have been an Ornament, and support to the Crown and Church of England, both in your Person and Posterity. Many great Men no doubt have sprung from your example, but none equalling those descended from your self. The late brave Earl of Ossery, advanced the Honour of our Nation, both by Sea and Land. 'Tis hard to say in which Element he made us most renown'd, and for which vertue. He was no more to be vanquished by falshood than fear; Loyalty, Fidelity, and Gallantry, are Vertues inseparable from the House of Ormond; we find e'm in every branch of it, and at all seasons. The Earl of Arran, Attacked in the late days of Confusion, a Bloody, Popular, and Formidable Error in its Camp, Fortified and Defended by all the strength of England; and for ever secur'd his own, and so much of the Publick reputation as was entrusted to him; managing that charge with the same Wisdom, Justice, and Fidelity he has done the Kingdom of Ireland, and many other great Commands, for the Honour and Service of the King. In the Young Earl of Ossery we have great assurances, the Grandfather and Father shall live in him, and receive the last rewards of Vertue Men are capable of in this World, to have their Honour and Happiness extend beyond their own beings. And herein the History of your Grace seems a Comment on the Fifth Commandment, you have always Honoured the Father of your Country, and your Days of Honour continue long in the Land, in your own Person, and your Illustrious Race. A useful President to England. </p>
        <p>That I may approve my self an honest and grateful English-man, is one reason of my Address: I have also other obligations on me. Your Grace has been a Princely patron and encourager of Poetry; a Pleasant but Barren Country where my Genius and inclination has cast me. I am entangled among the inclinations of it, though it affords nothing but a good Ayre, a little vain reputation, and we must climb for it, and shall miss it too, if envy or ill nature can hinder us. There were no living, if some great Men elevated not only in Quality but Understanding above the rest of the World, did not Protect us from these Barbarians, because they know us. I beseech your Grace then give me leave to pay my Duty to you. Many and great are your Revenues in Honour, in the Camp, the Court, the Church, and the whole Common-wealth of Learning. The Poet may be employed as well as the Historian. I have made but a small Collection, but I have put it in hands that I hope will not soon embezle it. This Comedy has rais'd it self such a fortune in the World, I believe it will not soon run away. Give it leave to Honour it self with your great Name, and me with the Title of, </p>

        <head>The Prologue. </head>
        <l>WHat are the Charmes, by which these happy Isles </l>
        <l>Hence gain'd Heaven's brightest and eternal smiles? </l>
        <l>What Nation upon Earth besides our own, </l>
        <l>But by a loss like ours had been undone? </l>
        <l>Ten Ages scarce such Royal worths display </l>
        <l>As England lost, and found in one strange Day. </l>
        <l>One hour in sorrow and confusion hurld, </l>
        <l>And yet the next the envy of the World. </l>
        <l>Nay we are blest, in spite of us 'tis known, </l>
        <l>Heavens choice for Us was better than our own. </l>
        <l>To stop the blessings that oreflow this day, </l>
        <l>What heaps o' Rogues we pild up in the way? </l>
        <l>We chose fit tooles against all good to strive, </l>
        <l>The sawciest, lewdest, Protestants alive. </l>
        <l>They wou'd have form'd a blessed Church indeed, </l>
        <l>Upon a Turn-coate Doctor's lying Creed. </l>
        <l>To know if e're he took Degree is hard, </l>
        <l>'Tis thought he'l have one in the Palace Yard, </l>
        <l>Plot swallowers sure will Drink no more stuff down, </l>
        <l>From that foul Pitcher when his Ears are gone. </l>
        <l>Let us rely on Conscience, not on Cheats, </l>
        <l>On Heavens wisdom, not on Juglers feats. </l>
        <l>How greatly Heaven has our great loss supplyed? </l>
        <l>'Tis no small Vertue heales a Wound so wide. </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000510-004-a"/>
        <l>Nay in so little time to reer our Head, </l>
        <l>To our own wonder, and our Neighbours dread. </l>
        <l>They see that Valour Crown'd with regal Power, </l>
        <l>They oft have seen what Lawrels Crown'd before. </l>
        <l>Verse is too narrow for so Great a Name, </l>
        <l>Far sounding Seas hourly repeat His Fame. </l>
        <l>Our Neighbours vanquish'd Fleets oft wafted o're, </l>
        <l>His Name to theirs and many a trembling Shore; </l>
        <l>And we may go by His great Conduct led </l>
        <l>As far in Fame as our Forefathers did. </l>
        <l>At home he milder ways to Glory chose, </l>
        <l>God like, by Patience he subdued his Foes; </l>
        <l>Now they and their designs are Ruin'd all, </l>
        <l>Beneath their fallen, accurst, Excluding Wall. </l>
        <l>These are not all the blessings of this Isle, </l>
        <l>Heaven on our Nation in a Queen does smile. </l>
        <l>Whose Vertue's Grace by Beauty shine so bright, </l>
        <l>All the Fair Sex to Vertue She'l invite; </l>
        <l>And all the Clouds turn to a glorious Day, </l>
        <l>By that Illustrious paire's united ray, </l>
        <l>Who both Reform and Grace Us by their sway. </l>

        <l>'TIs a hard Case, an Audience now to please, </l>
        <l>For every Pallat's spoyl'd with some Disease. </l>
        <l>Poor Plays as fast as Women now decay, </l>
        <l>They'r seldom car'd for after the first day; </l>
        <l>How often have I heard true wit call'd stuff, </l>
        <l>By Men with nothing in their Brains but Snuff? </l>
        <l>Each Shante Spark, that can the Fashion hit, </l>
        <l>Place his Hat thus, role full Forsooths a Wit; </l>
        <l>And thinks his Cloaths allows him judge of it. </l>
        <l>The City Gallant, the Exchange being done, </l>
        <l>Takes Sword at Temple-Bar which Nice stuck on. </l>
        <l>Comes here and passes for a Beaugarzoon. </l>
        <l>Audacious Vizards too, so fast do grow, </l>
        <l>You hardly can the Virtuous from 'em know. </l>
        <l>Nay Parents now not likely can endure, </l>
        <l>Their Childrens faults, but what is worse procure. </l>
        <l>Of Old the Mother full of Parent sway, </l>
        <l>Kept Miss a Vassal to her work all day; </l>
        <l>And to the Wooing Spark Miss was not brought, </l>
        <l>But some fine Golden thing her wheedle wrought: </l>
        <l>Now you shall meet young Lady and her Mother, </l>
        <l>Rambling in Hackny-Coaches masqu't together; </l>
        <l>Yes, and to say the truth, to work they go, </l>
        <l>Fine work but— such as they will never shew. </l>
        <l>Vnless some Nott to draw a Fool to Wed, </l>
        <l>And then he finds Miss rare at work a Bed. </l>
        <l>But the Grand Randevouz is kept of late, </l>
        <l>Exact at Nine, hard by o're Chocholate, </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000510-005-a"/>
        <l>Sad fate, that all the Christian Youth o'th' Nation, </l>
        <l>Should be oblig'd to Jews for Procreation. </l>
        <l>Nay, what is worse, that's, if reports be true, </l>
        <l>Many a Christian Gallant there turns Jew; </l>
        <l>That is, so oft some rotten Strumpet plyes him, </l>
        <l>The Chirurgion's forc't at last to Circumcise him. </l>
        <l>Our Bridges-street is grown a Strumpet Fair, </l>
        <l>Where higling Bawds do Palmb their rotten Ware. </l>
        <l>There Fowler like the watching Gallant Pores </l>
        <l>Behind his Glove, to get a shot at Whores; </l>
        <l>And from his tongue lets flye such charming Words, </l>
        <l>That strait he carrys off the wounded Birds. </l>
        <l>Another waits above in the great Room, </l>
        <l>Till a new Cargozoon of Strumpets come. </l>
        <l>There by three Glasses plac't the Affected Dunce, </l>
        <l>Acts you Four Courtly-Nices all at once; </l>
        <l>Our Gallerys too, were finely us'd of late, </l>
        <l>Where roosting Masques sat cackling for a Mate: </l>
        <l>They came not to see Plays but act their own, </l>
        <l>And had throng'd Audiences when we had none. </l>
        <l>Our Plays it was impossible to hear, </l>
        <l>The honest Country Men were forc't to swear: </l>
        <l>Confound you, give your bawdy prating o're, </l>
        <l>Or Zounds, I'le fling you i' the Pitt, you bawling Whore— </l>
        <l>This Comedy throws all that lewdness down, </l>

            <p>Ay, or if they wont Daughters will corrupt their Mothers.

There never was such an open and general War made on Virtue; young ones of Thirteen will pickeere at it, and by that time they are twenty, they are risen to be Strumpets General, and march in publick with their Baggage, with Miss, and Mass, and Nurse and Maid, and a whole train of Reformade sinners, expecting the next Cully that falls. </p>
