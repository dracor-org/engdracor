Brother and brother at ods, tis naught: sure, it was not thus in the days of charity. Whats this world lyke to? Faith iust like an Inne-keepers Chamber-pot, receiues all waters, good and bad, It had need of much scouring. My old mast kept a good house, and twenty or thirty tall sworde and Buckler men about him, and y faith his sonne differs not much, he wil haue mettle to, tho he hath not store of Cutlers blades, he will haue plentie of Vintners pots. His father kept a good house for honest men, <pb xml:id="ep000306-020-b"/>his Tenants, that brought him in part, and his son keeps a bad de house with Knaues that helpe to consume al. Tis but the change of time: why shoulde any man repyne at it: Crekits, good liuing, and lucky wormes, were wont to feede, sing, and reioyce in the fathers chimney, and nowe Carrion Crowes builds in the sons Kitchen, I could be sorry for it, but I am too old to weepe. Well then, I will go tel him newes of his of-springs. </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
