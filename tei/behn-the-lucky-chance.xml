        <p>WHen I consider how Ancient and Honourable a Date Plays have born, how they have been the peculiar Care of the most Illustrious Persons of Greece and Rome, who strove as much to out doe each other in Magnificence, (when by Turns they manag'd the great Business, of the Stage, as if they had contended for the Victory of the Vniverse:) I say, my Lord, when I consider this, I with the greater Assurance most humbly address this Comedy to your Lordship, since by Right of Antient Custom, the Patronage of Plays belong'd only to the great Men, and chiefest Magistrates. Cardinal Richelie●…, that great and wise Statesman, said, That there was no surer Testimony to be given of the flourishing Greatness of a Stars, than publick Pleasures and Divertisements— for they are says he— the Schools of Vertue, where Vice is always either 〈◊〉 or disdain'd. They are seoret Instruitions to the People, in things that 'tis impossible to insinuate into them any other Way. 'Tis Example that prevails above Reason or <hi>Divin●… Prcepts </hi>(Philosophy not understood by the 〈◊〉) 'tis Example alone that inspires Morality, and best establishes Verine. I have my self known a Man, whom neither Conscience nor Religion c●…'d perswade to Loyalty, who with beholding in our Theatre a Modern Politician <pb xml:id="ep000449-003-a"/>set forth in all his Colours, was converted, renounc'd his Opinion, and quitted the Party. </p>
        <p>The Abbot of Aubignac, to shew that Plays have been ever held most important to the very Political Part of Government, says, The Phylosophy of Greece, and the Majesty and Wisdom of the Romans, did equally concern their Great Men in making them Venerable, Noble and Magnificent: Venerable, by their Consecration to their Gods: Noble, by being govern'd by their chiefest Men; and their Magnificency was from the publick Treasury, and the liberal Contributions of their Noble Men. </p>
        <p>It being undeniable then, that Plays and publick Diversions were thought by the Greatest and Wisest of States, one of the most essential Parts of good Government, and in which so many great Persons were interested; suffer me to beg your Lordships Patronage for this little Endeavour, and believe it not below the Grandure of your Birth and State, the Illustrious Places you so justly hold in the Kingdom, nor your Illustrious Relation to the greatest Monarch of the World, to afford it the Glory of your Protection; since it is the Product of a Heart and Pen, that always faithfully serv'd that Royal Cause, to which your Lordship is by many Tyes so firmly fixt. It approaches you with that absolute Veneration, that all the World is oblig'd to pay you; and has no other Design than to express my sense of those excellent Vertues, that make your Lordship so truly admir'd and lov'd. Amongst which we find those two so rare in a Great Man and a Statesman, those of Gracious Speech and easie Access, and I believe none were ever sent from your Presence dissatisfied. You have an Art to please even when you deny; and something in your Look and Voice has an Air so greatly good, it recompences even for Disappointment, and we never leave your Lordship but with Blessings. It is no less our Admiration, to behold with what Serenity and perfect Conduct, that great Part of the Nations Business is carry'd on, by one single Person; who having to do with so vast Numbers of Men of all Qualitys, Interests and Humours, nevertheless all are well satisfi'd, and none complain of Oppression, but all is done with Gentleness and Silence, as if (like the first Creator) you cou'd finish all by a <pb xml:id="ep000449-003-b"/>Word. You have, my Lord, a Judgment so pier●…g and solid, a Wisdom so quick and clear, and a Fortitude so truly Noble, that those Fatigues of State, that wou'd even sink a Spirit of less Magnitude, is by yours accomplish't without Toil, or any Appearance of that harsh and crabbed Austerity, that is usually put on by the b●…isy Great. You, my Lord, support the Globe, as if you did not feel its Weight; nor so much as seem to bend beneath it: Your Zeal for the Glorious Monarch you love and serve, makes all things a Pleasure that advance his Interest, which is so absolutely your Care. You are, my Lord, by your generous Candor, your unbyast Justice, your Sweetness, Affability and Condescending Goodness (those never-failing Marks of Greatness) above that Envy which reigns in Courts, and is aim'd at the most elevated Fortunes and Noblest Favourites of Princes: And when they consider your Lordship, with all the Abilitys and Wisdom of a great Counsellor, your unblemisht Vertue, your unshaken Loyalty, your constant Industry for the Publick Good, how all things under your Part of Sway have been refin'd and purg'd from those Grossnesses, Frauds, Briberys, and Grievances, beneath which so many of his Majestys Subjects groan'd, when we see Merit establish't and prefer'd, and Vice discourag'd; it imposes Silence on Malice it self, and compells em to bless his Majesty's Choice of such a Pillar of the State, such a Patron of Vertue. </p>
        <p>Long may your Lordship live to remain in this most Honourable Station, that his Majesty may be serv'd with an entire Fidelity, and the Nation be render'd perfectly Happy. Since from such Heads and Hearts, the Monarch reaps his Glory, and the Kingdom receives its Safety and Tranquility. This is the unfeign'd Prayer of </p>

        <head>PREFACE. </head>
        <p>THe little Obligation I have to some of the witty Sparks and Poets of the Town, has put me on a Vindication of this Comedy from those Censures that Malice, and ill Nature have thrown upon it, tho in vain: The Poets I heartily excuse, since there is a sort of Self-Interest in their Malice, which I shou'd rather call a witty Way they have in this Age, of Railing at every thing they find with pain successful, and never to shew good Nature and speak well of any thing; but when they are sure 'tis damn'd, then they afford it that worse Scandal, their Pity. And nothing makes them so through-stitcht an Enemy as a full Third Day, that's Crime enough to load it with all manner of Infamy; and when they can no other way prevail with the Town, they charge it with the old never failing Scandal— That 'tis not fit for the Ladys: As if (if it were as they falsly give it out) the Ladys were oblig'd to hear Indecencys only from their Pens and Plays and some of them have ventur'd to treat 'em as Coursely as 'twas possible, without the least Reproach from them; and in some of their most Celebrated Plays have entertained 'em with things, that if I should here strip from their Wit and Occasion that conducts 'em in and makes them proper, their fair Cheeks would perhaps wear a natural Colour at the reading them: yet are never taken Notice of, because a Man writ them, and they may hear that from them they blush at from a Woman— But I make a Challenge to any Person of common Sense and Reason— that is not wilfully bent on ill Nature, and will in spight of Sense wrest a double Entendre from every thing, lying upon the Catch for a Jest or a Quibble, like a Rook for a Cully; but any unprejudic'd Person that knows not the Author, to read any of my Comedys and compare 'em with others of this Age, and if they find one Word that can offend the chastest Ear, I will submit to all their peevish Cavills; but Right or Wrong they must be Criminal because a Woman's; condemning them without having the Christian Charity, to examine whether it be guilty or not, with reading, comparing, or thinking; the Ladies taking up any Scandal on Trust from some conceited Sparks, who will in spight of Nature be Wits and Beaus; then scatter it for Authentick all over the Town and Court, poysoning of others Judgment <pb xml:id="ep000449-004-b"/>with their false Notions, condemning it to ●…orso th●… Death, Loss of Fame. And to fortis●… their Detraction, charge me with all the Plays that have ever been o●…sive; though I wish with all their Faults I had been the Author of some of those they have honour'd me with. </p>
        <p>For the farther Justification of this Play; it being a Comedy of Intrigne, Dr. Daven●… out of Respect to the Commands he had from Court, to take great Care that no Indecency should be in Plays, sent for it and nicely look't it over, putting out any thing he but imagin'd the Criticks would play with. After that, Sir <hi>Rog●… L'Estrange </hi>read it and licens'd it, and found no such Faults as 'tis charg'd with: Then Mr. Killigrew, who more severe than any, from the strict Order he had, perus'd it with great Circumspection; and lastly the Master Players, who you will I hope in some Measure esteem Judges of Decency and their own interest, having been so many Years Prentice to the Trade of Judging. </p>
        <p>I say, after all these Supervisors the Ladys may be convinc'd, they left nothing that cou'd offend, and the Men of their unjust Reflections on so many Judges of Wit and Decencys. When it happens that I challenge any one, to point me out the least Expression of what some have made their Discourse, they cry, <hi>That Mr. </hi>Leigh <hi>opens his Night Gown, when he comes into the Bride-chamber</hi>; if he do, which is a Jest of his own making, and which I never saw, I hope he has his Cloaths on underneath? And if so, where is the Indecency? I have seen in that admirable Play of Ocdipus, the Gown open'd wide, and the Man shown in his Drawers and Wastecoat, and never thought it an Offence before. Another orys, <hi>Why me know not what they mean, when the Man takes a Woman off the Stage, and another is thereby cuckolded</hi>; is that any more than you see in the most Celebrated of your Plays? as the <hi>City Politicks</hi>, the <hi>Lady Mayoress</hi>, and the <hi>Old Lawyers Wife</hi>, who goes with a Man she never saw before, and comes out again the joyfull'st Woman alive, for having made her Husband a Cuckold with such Dexterity, and yet I see nothing unnatural nor obscene: tis proper for the Characters. So in that lucky Play of the <hi>London Cuckolds</hi>, not to recite Particulars. And in that good Comedy of <hi>Sir Courcy Nice</hi>, the <hi>Taylor to the young Lady</hi>— in the fam'd Sir <hi>Fopling Dor●…ont </hi>and Relli●…, see the very Words— In Valentinian, see the Scene between the <hi>Court Bands</hi>. And Valentinian all loose and rusl'd a Moment after the Rape, and all this you see without scandal, and a thousand others The Moor of Venice in many places. The <hi>Maids Tragedy</hi>— see the Scene of undressing the Bride, and between the King and Amintor, and after between the King and 〈◊〉— All these I Name as some of the best Plays I know; If I should repeat the Words exprest in these Scenes I mention, I might justly be charg'd <pb xml:id="ep000449-005-a"/>with course ill Manners, and very little Modesty, and yet they so naturally fall into the places they are designed for, and so are proper for the Business, that there is not the least Fault to be found with them; though I say those things in any of mine wou'd damn the whole Peice, and alarm the Town. Had I a Day or two's time, as I have scarce so many Hours to write this in (the Play, being all printed off and the Press waiting,) I would sum up all your Beloved Plays, and all the things in them that are past with such Silence by; because written by Men: such Masculine Strokes in me, must not be allow'd. I must conclude those Women (if there be any such) greater Criticks in that sort of Conversation than my self, who find any of that sort in mine, or any thing that can justly be reproach't. But 'tis in vain by dint of Reason or Comparison to convince the obstinate Criticks, whose Business is to find Fault, if not by a loose and gross Imagination to create them, for they must either find the Jest, or make it; and those of this sort fall to my share, they find Faults of another kind for the Men Writers. And this one thing I will venture to say, though against my Nature, because it has a Vanity in it: That had the Plays I have writ come forth under any Mans Name, and never known to have been mine; I appeal to all unbyast Judges of Sense, if they had not said that Person had made as many good Comedies, as any one Man that has writ in our Age; but a Devil on't the Woman damns the Poet. </p>
        <p>Ladies, for its further Justification to you, be pleas'd to know, that the first Copy of this Play was read by several Ladys of very great Quality, and unquestioned Fame, and received their most favourable Opinion, not one charging it with the Crime, that some have been pleas'd to find in the Acting. Other Ladys who saw it more than once, whose Quality and Vertue can sufficiently justifie any thing they design to favour, were pleas'd to say, they found an Entertainment in it very far from scandalous; and for the Generality of the Town, I found by my Receipts it was not thought so Criminal. However, that shall not be an Incouragement to me to trouble the Criticks with new Occasion of affronting 〈◊〉 for endeavouring at least to divert; and at this rate, both the few Poets that are left, and the Players who toil in vain, will be weary of their Trade. </p>
        <p>I cannot omit to tell you, that a Wit of the Town, a Friend of mine at Wills Coffee House, the first Night of the Play, cry'd it down as much as in him lay, who before had read it and assured me he never saw a prettier Comedy. So complaisant one pestilent Wit will be to another, and in the full Cry make his Noise too; but since 'tis to the witty Few I speak, I hope the better Judges will take no Offence, to whom I am oblig'd for better Judgments; and those I hope will be so kind to me, knowing my Conversation not at all addicted to the Indecencys alledged, that I would much less practice <pb xml:id="ep000449-005-b"/>it in a Play, that must stand the Test of the censuring World. And I must want common Sense, and all the Degrees of good Manners, renouncing my Fame, all Modesty and Interest for a silly Sawcy 〈◊〉 〈◊〉 to make Fools laugh, and Women blush, and wise Men asham'd; My self all the while, if I had been guilty of this Crime charg'd to me, remaining the only stupid, inse●…lible. Is this likely, is this reasonable to be believ'd by any body, but the wilfully blind? All I ask, is the Priviledge for my Masculine Part the Poet in me, (if any such you will allow me) to tread in those successful Paths my Predecessors have so long thriv'd in, to take those Measures that both the Ancient and Modern Writers have set me, and by which they have pleas'd the World so well. If I must not, because of my Sex, have this Freedom, but that-you will usurp all to your selves I lay down my Quill, and you shall hear no more of me, no not so much as to make Comparisons, because I will be kinder to my brothers of the Pen, than they have been to a desenceless Woman; for I am no●… content to write for a Third day only. I value Fame as much as if I had been born a Hero; and if you rob me of that, I can retire from the ungrateful World, and scorn its sickle Favours. </p>

        <lg>
          <l>SInce with Old Plays you have so long been cloy'd, </l>
          <l>As with a Mistress many Years enjoy'd: </l>
          <l>How briskly dear Variety you pursue; </l>
          <l>Nay though for worse ye change, ye will have New. </l>
          <l>Widdows take heed, some of you in fresh Youth </l>
          <l>Have been th' unpity'd Martyrs of this Truth. </l>
          <l>When for a drunken Sot, that had kind hours, </l>
          <l>And taking their own Freedoms, left you yours; </l>
          <l>'Twas your delib'rate Choice your Days to pass </l>
          <l>With a damn'd, sober self-admiring Ass; </l>
          <l>Who thinks good usage for the Sex unfit, </l>
          <l>And slights ye out of Sparkishness and Wit. </l>
          <l>But you can fit him— Let a worse Fool come, </l>
          <l>If he neglect, to officiate in his room. </l>
          <l>Vain Amorous Coxcombs every where are found, </l>
          <l>Fops for all uses, but the Stage abound. </l>
          <l>Tho you shou'd change them oftener than your Fashions, </l>
          <l>There still wou'd be enough for your Occasions: </l>
          <l>But ours are not so easily suppli'd, </l>
          <l>All that cou'd e'er quit cost, we have already tri'd. </l>
          <l>Nay, dear some times have bought the Frippery Stuff. </l>
          <l>This, Widows, you— I mean the old and tough— </l>
          <l>Will never think, be they but Fool enough. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Such will with any kind of Puppies play; </l>
          <l>But we must better know for what we pay: </l>
          <l>We must not purchase such dull Fools as they. </l>
          <l>Shou'd we shew each her own partic'lar Dear, </l>
          <l>What they admire at home, they wou'd loath here. </l>
          <l>Thus, tho the Mall, the Ring, the Pit is full, </l>
          <l>And every Coffee-House still swarms with Fool: </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000449-006-b"/>
          <l>Tho still by Fools all other Callings live, </l>
          <l>Nay our own Women by fresh Cullys thrive. </l>
          <l>Tho your Intrigues which no Lampoon can cure, </l>
          <l>Promise a long Succession to ensure, </l>
          <l>And all your Matches Plenty do presage: </l>
          <l>Dire is the Dearth and Famine on the Stage. </l>
          <l>Our Store's quite wasted, and our Credit's small, </l>
          <l>Not a Fool left to bless our selves withal. </l>
          <l>We're forc't at last to rob, (which is great pity, </l>
          <l>Though 'tis a never-foiling Bank) the City. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>We show you one to day intirely new, </l>
          <l>And of all Jests, none relish like the true. </l>
          <l>Let that the value of our Play inhance, </l>
          <l>Then itmay prove indeed the <hi>Luckey Chance</hi>. </l>

          <l>Well may you rail at what you Ape so ill. </l>
