              <p>MY friends and vnhappie Countrymen, whom the lawes of England, haue worthilie condemned vnto death for your open and vnnaturall Rebellion against your lawfull Soueraigne and annointed Prince. I am sent vnto you from the Kinges most excellent Maiestie to giue you to vnderstand, that notwithstanding this violence which you haue offered to your selues, in running furiously into the daunger of the law, as mad and franticke men vpon an edged sword: yet notwithstanding I say, that you haue gathered rods to scourge your own selues, following desperatlie your lewd and misgouerned heads, which haue haled you on to this wretched and shamefull end which is now imminent ouer you all, that must in strangling cords die like dogs, and finish your liues in this miserable reprochful sort, because you would not liue like men: But far vnlike your selues vnlike Englishmen, degenerate from your naturall obedience, &amp; nature of your country, that by kinde bringeth forth none such, or at least brooketh none such, but spits then out for bastards and recreants: notwithstanding I say, (this torment wherein you nowe liue looking euerie houre to suffer such a shamefull and most detestable death, as doth commonly, belonge to such horrible offenders) yet it hath pleased the King of his accustomed goodnes to giue you <pb xml:id="ep000288-023-a"/>your liues, and freelie to forgiue you your faults sending by mee generall Pardon to you all, excepting one onely accursed and seditious Priest, that so far swarued from the truth, and his alleageance to his Prince, and one Wat Tiler, whose outrage hath bin noted so outragious in al his actions as for ensample to all Englishmen hereafter, his Maiestie hath thought good to account him &amp; this Parson, (first sturrers in this tumult, and vnnaturall rebelling) the greatest offenders that now liue to grieue his Maiestie: and thus I haue deliuered the message of the King, which is in effect, generall pardon to you all, and a sentence of death vnto the two Archrebels, Iohn Ball, and Wat Tyler: For which great Grace, if you thinke your selues any thinge bound to his highnes (as infinitely you are) let it appeare as farre forth hereafter as you may, either by outward signes of dutie, or inward loyaltie of harts expressed, and to begin the same, in signe of your thankefulnes, say all God saue the King. </p>
