        <head>PROLOGUE. </head>
        <l>WItts, like Physitians never can agree, </l>
        <l>When of a different Societie. </l>
        <l>And Rabels Drops were never more cry'd down </l>
        <l>By all the Learned Doctors of the Town, </l>
        <l>Than a New Play whose Author is unknown. </l>
        <l>Nor can those Doctors with more Malice sue </l>
        <l>(And powerful Purses) the discenting Few, </l>
        <l>Than those with an Insulting Pride, do raile </l>
        <l>At all who are not of their own Caball: </l>
        <l>If a Young Poet hitt your Humour right, </l>
        <l>You judg him then out of Revenge and Spight. </l>
        <l>So amongst men there are Ridiculous Elves, </l>
        <l>Who Monkeys hate for being too like themselves. </l>
        <l>So that the reason of the grand debate, </l>
        <l>Why Witt so oft is damn'd, when good Plays take, </l>
        <l>Is, that you Censure as you love, or hate. </l>
        <l>Thus like a Learned Conclave Poets sit, </l>
        <l>Catholique Iudges both of Sense and Wit, </l>
        <l>And Damn or Save, as they themselves think fit. </l>
        <l>Yet those who to others faults are so severe, </l>
        <l>Are not so perfect but themselves may Erre. </l>
        <l>Some write Coract indeed, but then the whole </l>
        <l>(Bating their own Dull stuff i'th' Play) is stole: </l>
        <l>As Bees do suck from Flowers their Honey dew, </l>
        <l>So they rob others striving to please you. </l>
        <l>Some write their Characters Gentile and fine, </l>
        <l>But then they do so Toyl for every line, </l>
        <pb xml:id="ep000451-002-a"/>
        <l>That what to you does Easie seem, and Plain, </l>
        <l>Is the hard Issue of their labouring Brain. </l>
        <l>And some th' Effects of all their pains we see, </l>
        <l>Is but to Mimick good Extemporie. </l>
        <l>Others by long Converse about the Town, </l>
        <l>Have Witt enough to write a Lew'd Lampoon, </l>
        <l>But their chief skill lyes in a Bawdy Song. </l>
        <l>In short, the only Witt that's now in Fashon, </l>
        <l>Is but the gleenings of good Conversation. </l>
        <l>As for the Author of this Coming Play, </l>
        <l>I ask't him what he thought fit I shou'd say </l>
        <l>In thanks for your good Company to day: </l>
        <l>He call'd me Fool, and said it was well known, </l>
        <l>You came not here for our sakes, but your own. </l>
        <l>New Plays are stuff'd with Witts, and with Deboches, </l>
        <l>That Crowd and sweat like Citts, in May-Day Coaches. </l>

        <l>At home, behold a more Accomplisht Ass, </l>
        <l>Where they may set their Cravats, Wigs and Faces, </l>
        <l>And Practice all their Buffonry Grimasses: </l>
        <l>See how this— Huff becomes,— this Damny,— stare,— </l>
        <l>Which they at home may act, because they dare, </l>
        <l>But— must with prudent caution do elsewhere. </l>
        <l>Oh that our Nokes, or <hi>Tony Lee </hi>cou'd show </l>
        <l>A Fop but half so much to th' life as you. </l>

        <p>This Play had been sooner in Print, but for a Report about the Town (made by some either very Malitious or very Ignorant) that 'twas Thomaso alter'd; which made the Book-sellers fear some trouble from the Proprietor of that Admirable Play, which indeed has Wit enough to stock a Poet, and is not to be peec't or mended by any but the Excellent Author himself; That I have stoln some hints from it, may be a proof, that I valu'd it more than to pretend to alter it▪ had I had the Dexterity of some Poets, who are not more Expert in stealing than in the Art of Concealing, and who even that way out-do the Spartan-Boyes. I might have appropriated all to my self, but I, vainly proud of my Iudgment, hang out the Sign of Angellica, (the only stoln Object) to give Notice where a great part of the Wit dwelt; tho if the Play of the Novella were as well worth remembring as Thomaso, they might (bating the Name) have as well said, I took it from thence: I will only say the Plot and Bus'ness (not to boast on't) is my own: as for the Words and Characters, I leave the Reader to judge and compare 'em with Thomaso, to whom I recommend the great Entertainment of reading it, tho had this succeeded ill, I shou'd have had no need of imploring that Iustice from the Criticks, who are naturally so kind to any that pretend to usurp their Dominion, they wou'd doubtless have given me the whole Honour on't. Therefore I will only say in English what the famous Virgil does in <hi>Latin; I make Verses, and others have the Fame. </hi>
