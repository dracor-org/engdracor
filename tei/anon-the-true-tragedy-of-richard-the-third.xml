But to be briefe, when both the battels ioyned, these two and others, shifted me away. </p>

          <p>A sonne he left, a Harry of that name, a worthie, valiant, and victorious Prince, for on the fifth yeare of his happie raigne, hee entered France, and to the Frenchmens costs, hee wonne Turwen, and Turney. The Emperor serued this King for common pay, and as a mersonary prince did follow him. Then after Morle and Morles, conquered he, and still did keepe the French men at a bay. And lastly in this Kings decreasing age, he conquered Bullen, and after when he was turned home he died, when he had raigned full thirtie eight yeares, nine moneths and some odde dayes, and was buried in Windsore. He died and left three famous springs behinde him. </p>
