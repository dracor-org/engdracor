        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>WHilst all Europe besides, lies now groaning under the Weight of a Crual War, and sees on every side her Cities sack't and spoilled; her Fields laid desolate, and her Provinces exhausted both of Blood and Treasure; England; alone, by Your Royal Care, does now injoy a happy Tranquility and sees Peace and Justice raign in all her Borders. <pb xml:id="ep000667-004-a"/>One would think, this Fortunate Isle were by heaven set apart to prove a New Ark; amost safe Harbor still ready to receive and shelter all the shatter'd remains of the Wreck't Vniverse: that it were a perfect Epitome of the whole Earth, in which lies concenterd all it produces of rich and most precious; a Rock fixt and unmoveable in the midst of the roughest Waves, and highest Tempests: An Earthly Paradice, inviron'd round about with Sandy Desarts; and, in fine, that England were, as indeed she is, above all others in the World, Heaven's-Darling, the Earths Delight, the Seas Soveraign Queen; the Eye, the Heart, the Pearl of the whole World. </p>
        <p>But, SIR, all these high Prerogatives; all these choice Blisses She does injoy, seem'd little in Your Royal Eyes: Your Vast Mind was not yet fully satisfied, in having by Your Invincible Force made her Triumph over her Fierce and Audacious Enemies, bringing them (in spight of their Obstinacy) to Beg Peace at Your Royal Hands, and by that happy Peace, fild the hearts of Your People with Joy and Satisfaction: You would compleat the Splendor and Magnificence of Your Imperial Seat, by establishing within her stately Walls Your <pb xml:id="ep000667-004-b"/>Academy of Opera's, the fairest and most charming of all Publick Showes; You have made this Queen of Cities to become also the Center, the Source of Love, Pleasures, and Gallantry; raising her present Glory and Pomp to Pitch, capable rather of creating Envy and Emulation in the Proudest of her Neighbours, than being any more jealous of them for their Greatness and Magnificence. </p>
        <p>Your Majesty will doubtless find these <hi>First Representations of Your Opera </hi>very defective: But SIR, it dares flatter it self with hopes that You will pardon its faults, and consider that the Academy that executes the same is yet an Infant, a new-born Beauty, whose Features and Lineaments are scarce come to their shape and proportion; but, cannot fail growing to Perfection in her due time and age, provided You daign own her for Your Creature, and afford her Your Royal Care and Protection? These Gracious Favors, SIR, She humbly, and with a most profound Respect and Veneration, begs at Your Royal Hands; with a sincere Protestation, that her chiefest Application and Study shall ever be to strive to the uttermost of her Power, to contribute <pb xml:id="ep000667-005-a"/>to Your Diversion, and that she will gather together Your Palms, Your Laurels, and Your Royal Mirtles, into Wreaths and Garlands of Triumph to Crown Your Sacred Head with, as being, </p>

        <head>To the Reader. </head>
        <p>THe Reader is desir'd in Perusing this Book, to consider two things; First, That it is a meer Translation, and nothing else; and that the Original it self being neither a Strain of Wit, nor yet the Stile of it Puft up; but onely a bare Collection of Phrases, and Expressions made fit for Sound and Harmony: The Author, who is well enough fixt in his Reputation, would have thought himself wronged, had the Translator turn'd the Sense of his Work out of its right Channel. Secondly, That this Traduction was thought absolutely necessary for the satisfaction of those, who b 〈…〉 acquainted with the French Tongue, and who being Spectators, would find themselves necessitated to see the most pressing of their Senses go away from the Theater ungratified, by their not understanding the Subject that brought them thither. For the English, it will doubtless seem Flat, and too much a Stranger, to please the Criticks of the Time, whose nice Palates can scarce relish the Finest and most <hi>Natural Things </hi>their own Countrey can produce. But, let it run what fortune it will, it can fare no worse than a Thousand far better things have done: and, were both the Original and the Version much worse than they are, the Pomp and Magnificence of its Representations will alone prove sufficient to plead their excuse. </p>
