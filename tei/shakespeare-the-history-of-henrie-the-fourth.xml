They call drinking deepe, dying scarlet, and when you breath in your watering they cry hem, and bid you play it off. To conclude, I am so good a proficient in one quarter of an houre that I can drinke with any Tinker in his owne language, during my life. I tell thee Ned thou hast lost much honour, that thou wert not with me in this action; but sweete Ned, to sweeten which name of Ned, I giue thee this peniworth of sugar, clapt euen now into my hand by an vnderskinker, one that neuer spake other English in his life then eight shillings and sixe pence, and you are welcome, with this shrill addition, anon, anon sir; skore a pint of bastard in the halfe moone, or so. But Ned, to driue awaie the time till Falstalffe come: I preethe doe thou stande in some by-roome, while I question my puny drawer to what end he gaue me the sugar, and do thou neuer leaue calling Frances, that his tale to me may bee nothing but anon, step aside and ile shew thee a present.

This pitch (as ancient writers do report) doth defile, so doth the companie thou keepest: for Harrie, now I do not speake to thee in drinke, but in teares; not in pleasure but in passion: not in words onely, but in woes also: and yet there is a vertuous man, whom I haue often noted in thy companie, but I know not his name.

      Tis not due yet, I would be loath to pay him before his day, what need I be so forwarde with him that cals not on mee? Well, tis no matter, honor prickes me on yea, but how if honor pricke me off when I come on? how then can honor set to a leg? no, or an arme? no, or take away the griefe of a wound? no, honor hath no skil in surgerie then? no, what is honor? a word, what is in that word honor? what is that honour? aire, a trim reckoning. Who hath it? he that died a Wednesday, doth he feele it? no, doth he heare it? no, tis insensible them? yea, to the dead, but wil not liue with the liuing; no, why? detraction will not suffer it, therefore ile none of it, honor is a meere skutchion, and so ends my Catechisme.
