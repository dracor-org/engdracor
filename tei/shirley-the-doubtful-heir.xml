        <p>MAny years are vanished, and a period, not onely of the Scene, but more considerable revolutions have pass'd, since I had the happiness to be first known to you. I read excellent Characters of you, when you writ but a small Letter, and though my observations, like seeds, were not cherished (by the fault of time) to a maturity, yet they begat in me such great respect to your person, then budding with honour, and expectation, that now after so long absence, I find them not extinguished; and howsoever at the first complexion, I may appear bold, in this hasty interruption, yet your candour will be so far in my <pb xml:id="ep000819-004-a"/>defence, that I have presumed thus, rather to let you know I can still honour you, than unsatisfie my self, by neglecting the first opportunity of presenting my service. Sir, it is a piece, which perhaps you have seen in the active representment; the estimation it gained from thence, will be short of that grace it shall derive from your acceptance, by which you will shew, how still you dare retain your nobleness, and by renewing your smile upon me, encourage me to write my self </p>

        <p>The textual notes below aim at making textual corrections readable in their immediate context and facilitating access to the source text. A five-digit number preceded by 'A' or 'B' represents an EEBO-TCP filenumber. A notation like "6-b-2890" means "look for EEBO page image 6 of that text, word 289 on the right side of the double-page image." That reference is followed by the corrupt reading. A black dot stands for an unidentified letter, a black square for an unidentified punctuation mark, a diamond for a missing word, and the ellipsis for a short span of undefined length. The corrected reading is displayed as a keyword in context.</p>
