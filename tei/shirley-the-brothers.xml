          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>The Memory and Contemplation of good Offices received, which, by their own nature, and impulsion, have inclined other men to bee active in their returnes, have not wrought me into so much boldness; For when I considered my obligation to your favors I was still deterred by their greatness and number; For in my poverty I had thoughts not without Ambition to reach them with some merit, but when I was studying to proportion my gratitude, I fell much lower than when I was the object of your mercy. The way to releeve my self, is no more to look at what you have confer'd, but on <pb xml:id="ep000817-005-a"/>the bestower, for I have now learn'd to separate you from your benefits, and to convey my self into your pardon, by the exercise of your Charity. Thus in place of cancelling my former debts, I put your vertue to a new disbursment: Witness this Composition, which after its birth, had in my thoughts a dedication to your name, although it but now took the boldness to wear it in the forehead both as an Ornament and preserver. You were pleas'd to grace it with your fair opinion, when it was represented, and though it appear not in that naturall Dress of the Scene, nor so powerfull, as when it had the soul of action, yet your smile upon it now will give it second animation; by which I shall derive after so long a silence, a Confirmation of my happiness, in being still received </p>
