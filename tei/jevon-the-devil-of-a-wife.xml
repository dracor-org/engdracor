        <p>YOU are not to be told, that Poets are sawcy, very sawcy, mighty sawcy, but your (wou'd be) Poet, or Farce Snipper Snapper, such a Promiscuous Riddle me Re, as my self always super-abounding; Therefore do I heartily hope, but more humbly entreat, that with the Piercing Eye of Understanding, and through the Orbicuous Glass of Reason, you will perfectly discern, and then wholly attribute the bold Presumption of this sharp Epistle (as I may justly term it) to my Seeming self as Audacious Ievon the Poet, and not to my Real self as Modest Mr. Ievon the Player. But now I intend to give my self an unwilling Loose to Eloquent Words and Rhetorical Notions (which to Me have always Prompt and Ready bin.) <hi>Et ad Vnguem, &amp; ad Pennam, </hi>and forthwith cast my self upon the Naked Confines of Mediocrity, and in plain terms come pat and closely to you thus. </p>

        <p>You may please to call to mind and well remember that presently after our <hi>Catcall Dissolution</hi>, which for some time, from our Natural Home, and Provident Stage, dispers'd abroad Us Under-Acting Iews without a Moses to provide our Manna: And after the Prayers (as you may guess) of the many Murmuring Hirelings, for those whose Whistling Breath blew 'em to a more remote and far worse Climate, 'twas then the Needfull I (by dint of Hunger forc'd) wrote (you know full well) such Powerfull Lines to your unmindfull Senate, that had ye not All had Hearts of Stone you wou'd have melted into Retaliating Favours. Your speedy Promises were Great, but your slow Performances (witness ye Unassisting Gods) alas, were Small. Let this my All-Commanding Style, and most Ingenious Piece then now revive and whet your almost blunted Purpose, to a more lively, quick and solid Answer: Let me endear ye all (my Yet but seeming Friends, and promising Patrons only) to a more Ponderous Resolution. and Candid Answer to him that, Gad Judge me, ye know to be </p>

        <head>THE PREFACE. </head>
        <head type="sub">TO THE Grave, Learned, Judicious, and Deliberate. </head>
        <p>THE Modern Age, and present Representations, unknown to the Antiquated Limits, which in all bounds of Prevalent Atonements, supersede the Equinoctials of Illuminary Spirits, are not in the least captivated with the Decorum of Dress, fortunate and succeeding Action, exhausted Master of Volatory arrided Flashness, that now is not in self, <foreign xml:lang="lat">De Re Imaginaria neque supposita de futura, </foreign>Neither can their profound Precepts, who were known and ador'd as Patriarchs in Natures primitive Sanguinity with collatoral Adherents, with the noise of what was heretofore deliver'd, inculcate Predominancy to the Right Line of Monarchical and Episcopal Adherences. Therefore if in greater and more evident Points the Lawyer can no more be without <pb xml:id="ep000602-004-a"/>his Fee, than the Lord Chancellour his Mace, or a Poet without Errors, (my self alone exempted) why shou'd the Iudgment of a Man that is partially byass'd against the Banditti, rule the Authour's opinion in his own Hemisphere, and discuss at large the Virtues of Jobson's Wife, without the Management of Hobbs his Leviathan? Why shou'd <hi>Shakespear, Johnson, Beaumont, Fletcher, </hi>that are no way Adequate to the profound Intellects of my present Atonement, be rank'd above the Laborious, tho' dull States-man. <q>
            <lg>

        </p>
        <p>Those several Malignant Assertions offer'd, a large and a compendious Resolution ought to be maturely responded, especially, when the Eclypse of Matrimony is subterranially trod down. As to the main Notion of Polygamy absconded under a Cirtoot of Imagination, We take it thus. Alexander was Great and Victorious in his Mediterranean Engagements of Hospitality. To the contrary Julian the Apostate recites his own Benevolencies in <hi>semi Octavo </hi>of Traditional Vsury: Which plainly denotes the first Egression and the last Denotation. So that if we come to Modern Affairs, you will find that the Masq'd Middle Gallery, being by Command Superiour, brought bare-fac'd to the Prae-existent Spark's construction; more amuses the Sun-shine Planet of his Scarlet Coat, than the beat of an Irish Drum to an <hi>East Indie </hi>Interloper. <pb xml:id="ep000602-004-b"/>For what says <foreign xml:lang="lat">Terence (Paucis te Volo,) </foreign>which manifestly denotes the condescending temper of the Male, and the diving Aspect of the Female. Now if after so long a Concupiscential Appetite the Novelty of Weeding is to be adjudg'd Ceremonious, I leave to my Lord <hi>Chief Justice </hi>his Tipstaff to examine, and make all even between the Pope and my Lord Archhishop of Canterbury. </p>

        <l>HOW long is't since you saw I pray, </l>
        <l>That strange old fashion'd thing call'd a New Play. </l>
        <l>Or how long indeed d'ye think 'twill be, </l>

        <l>You may set your hearts at rest for this Age, </l>
        <l>Vnion and Catcaells have quite spoyl'd the Stage. </l>
        <l>Time was the Poets cou'd cock, look bigg, and cry, </l>
        <l>Damn these saucy Players, let's all agree, </l>
        <l>And starve the Rogues, the Times friends turned be, </l>
        <l>And I am turn'd Poet, there's Farce d'ye see. </l>
        <l>But now to my Geatheration friends, </l>

        <l>What quick return, or what concise amends. </l>

        <l>Let me have a pledge of it now y'are here, </l>

        <l>Be favourable to this same piece at hand, </l>
