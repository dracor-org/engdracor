        <p>WHen these amongst others of Mr. Thomas Middleton's Excellent Poems, came to my hands, I was not a little confident but that his name would prove as great an Inducement for thee to Read, as me to Print them: Since those Issues of his Brain that have already seen the Sun, have by their worth gained themselves a free entertainment amongst all that are ingenious: And I am most certain, that these will no way lessen his Reputation, nor hinder his Admission to any Noble and Recreative Spirits. All that I require <pb xml:id="ep000639-004-a"/>at thy hands, is to continue the Author in his deserved Esteem, and to accept of my Endeavors which have ever been to please thee. </p>
