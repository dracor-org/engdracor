        <p>I must acknowledge many years have past, since it did Vagire in Cunis, and when it had gotten strength, and legs to walk, traveling without direction, it lost it self, till it was recovered after much inquisition, and now upon the first return home, hath made this fortunate addresse, and application to your Patronage; In which my ambition is satisfied. </p>
        <p>I know this Nation hath been fruitfull in <pb xml:id="ep000748-003-a"/>names of Eminent Honor. But in these times, there be more Lords then Noblemen, and while you are pleas'd to smile upon this piece, I most cheerfully throw my selfe, and it upon your Protection, whose single worth to me, is beyond all the boasted Greatnesse and voluminous titles of our age. </p>
        <p>Be pleas'd to read, what is presented you, at an hour, you will dedicate to Recreation, and preserve the Author in your memory, whose highest desires are to make good the Character of </p>
