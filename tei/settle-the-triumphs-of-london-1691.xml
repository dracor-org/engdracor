        <head>TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE Sir THOMAS STAMP Knight; LORD MAYOR of the City of LONDON. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>MY LORD, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>HOnour ever looks Lovelyest, and shines Brightest, when 'tis the Recompence and Meed of Virtue; so great is the Difference between a Present and a Reward? Your Lordship ascends the <hi>Praetorial Chair </hi>under the last Qualification. Your Merits have planted You so fair a Mark for that Dignity You have received, that it is payd, not given You. And the Unanimous acknowledgements of all good Men are so sensible of a Desert so conspicuous, that their concurring best Wishes make you one United Congratulation. And that Your Lordship has so deserved, your Constant Zeal for the <hi>Honour of Your Country</hi>, is not the Business of Yesterday. Your Lordship set out an early Devote in so worthy a Cause. For Instance, several Years together in those memorable Days, when Intrigue &amp; Designe sat high at the Helm, Your unshaken Honour and Honesty were thought so dangerous to the then <pb xml:id="ep000723-003-a"/>State-Hammerers at the Anvil, that no less then Court-Power was pleased to rise up &amp; wage against You, witness the several potent, Oppositions made against you and your long Exclusion from your Rightful Entrance into Trust. But thanks to Providence, under the present more benign, &amp; more auspicious Administration, a Reign where Integrity qualifies for Magistracy, &amp; the Courtier &amp; the Patriot are not names incompatible, your Lordships Glory of being the Fear of that Age, intitles you to the Darling of this. And our proud Metropolis receives her saluted PRAEIOR so pleased at your Inauguration, and with such promising confidence of so upright and unbiast a Ministry of Equity &amp; Justice from your Lordship that she never entrusted her Scales and her Sword in a Worthier Hand. In which high post of Honour, I joyn but in the Universal Quire, when all Prosperity and Hoppiness to your Lordship are most heartily wisht by, <hi>My Lord</hi>, </p>

        <head>TO THE WORSHIPFUL COMPANY OF DRAPERS. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>Gentlemen, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>UNDER this fair Occasion of expressing my Gratitude, perhaps I take a fairer of gratifying my Pride, when I publish Your Generous Goodness in Accepting of my poor Talent for the Service of this <hi>Honourable City</hi>. My best Acknowledgments to Your Introducing Favour lye no little Duty upon me; and though I dare not Arrogate any Merit to so much Honour, yet at least I have this Advantage that I succeed not over-formidable Predecessours; Those Brothers of the Quill whose Pegasus has not soard so high, that there's much danger of my Flagging behind 'em. </p>
        <p>But when I Address to You my Kind and Worthy Patrons, I dare not pretend in so narrow a Paper to recount the Antiquity and Splendor of the Worshipful Company of DRAPERS. It is enough to say that the Honour of your Corporation extends as far as Trade can reach, or Canvas Wings can carry it; and from this little Island visits only those Nations of the World <pb xml:id="ep000723-004-a"/>that there is Sea to Travel to. And for Your First Original, Drapery is unquestionably so Ancient as to have the Honour of being the immediate Successor of the Fig-Leaves. And though we are not certain that our great First-Father began it within his Fair Eden, yet we are assured that <hi>Eves Spinstry </hi>and <hi>Adams Spade </hi>set to work together. And as for any Poetical Harangue to the Drapers Encomium, let it suffice that whilst there are <hi>Verdant Plains </hi>and <hi>Bleating Flocks</hi>, those innocent Panegyrists will do you more Justice, and speak much better than any weak flourish from the Pen of </p>

          <l>Bid my Triumphant Driving Chariot stay, </l>
          <l>Till to bright HONOUR I my Homage pay. </l>
          <l>That Pow'rful Hand must stop my rolling Wheels, </l>
