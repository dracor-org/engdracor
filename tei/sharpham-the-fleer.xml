        <head>TO THE READER and Hearer. </head>
        <p>FRiendlie perusers, or perusing friendes, that haue bin ouer-bold with some of vs, giue mee leaue to bee a little bold with you: I haue printed a Booke heere to make you laugh and lie downe too, if you please: I know it comes not like a Mous-trap to inueigle your good opinions, nor like newes of great Armies, very strange and vndreampt of, but like forfeits to a Vsurer long lookt for. If you finde anie errors by me committed correct them or neglect them. The Author is inuisible to me (viz. ith' Country) but where abouts I cannot learne; yet I feare hee will see mee too soone, for I had of him before his departure an Epistle or Apological praeamble (this being his first Minerua) directed vnto you, which should haue bin in this Page divulg'd, and (not to ieast with you because this booke plaies that part sufficiently) I haue lost it, remembring <pb xml:id="ep000261-003-a"/>none of the Contentes. And therfore (kinde Readers) I doe presume thus to salute you; vse these Comicall discourses fauourablie and you shall haue some from the Author heereafter more worthie your fauours and affections: through a narrow window you may view a broad Field; so in this modicum you may conceiue his great desire to delight you, But howsoeuer, I know this volume will be sweet in the palates of your minds, though your mouthes may finde it bitter in digestion, and so I commit your eyes to the next Page. </p>

There was a fellow with one of my Ladies this morning, and the poore slaue has but seauen shillings a weeke boord wages, and yet he has giuen sixe on't for a bit of extraordinarye flesh, well: God giue him the grace to pray, for a must fast. I askd the hot slaue why a did not marrie since a could not bridle his lust? and a tolde me a had rather fal into the Surgions mercy, then the worldes beggery; well, I see it cannot be denide, mercinarie women are necessarie members: they plucke downe the pride of the flesh, yet are not proud themselues, for thei'le be as familiar with the men as with the Master: they doe as many good deedes as some Fryers that puts one to pennance for his sinnes, they put twentie to paines: he out of charitie sends one to the Hospital once a yeare, they send twentie to the Surgions once a month. Say he bids men repent, they make a'm repent, yet for all this some will call a'm damn'd Puncks: well, if they bee damn'd, theile not be damn'd gratis like your yong countries Gentlemen, nor in hugger mugger like your Citizens wife with her Prentise. They can practise without an ouerseer: they scorne to haue a Suburbian Baw'd lend am a Taffaty gown, &amp; they (like your common Players) let men come in for two pence a peece, and yet themselues to haue but the tenth penny, like the tenth Pigge, yet faith the trade is a good trade: They for sweare not themselues, in commendation of their wares, as your common Tradesmen doe, swearing they cannot afford it at the price. They are no prouerb breakers: beware the buyer say they, you shall haue enough for your money, if halfe will not serue your turne take the whole, measure by your own yard, you shal haue Winchester measure. I was somewhat bold with one of their Ladiships this morning, &amp; askt her why women went to the generating sport al the yere, since beastes themselues went too't but once? And she answered me, because they were women, &amp; had reason to know what was good for themselues, and so had not beasts: but soft, here comes Signior Petoune. </p>
