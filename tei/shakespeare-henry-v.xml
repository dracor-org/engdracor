          <l>And Faramont the founder of this law and female barre: </l>
          <l>Yet their owne writers faithfully affirme </l>
          <l>That the land salicke lyes in Germany, </l>
          <l>Betweene the flouds of Sabeck and of Elme, </l>

          <l>Is at this time in Germany called Mesene: </l>
