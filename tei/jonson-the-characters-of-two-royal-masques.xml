        <head>THE QVEENES MASQVES. The first, of Blacknesse: personated at the Court, at White-Hall, on the Twelu'th night. 1605. </head>
        <p>THE honor, and splendor of these Spectacles was such in the performance, as could those houres haue lasted, this of mine, now, had beene a most vnprofitable worke: But (when it is the fate, euen of the greatest, and most absolute births, to need, and borrow a life of posterity) little had beene done to the study of magnificence in these, if presently with the rage of the people, who (as a part of greatnesse) are priuiledged by Custome, to deface their carkasses, the spirits had also perished. In dutie, therefore, to that Maiestie, who gaue them their authoritie, and grace; and, no lesse then the most royall of predecessors, deserues eminent celebration for these solemnities: I adde this later hand, to redeeme them as well from ignorance, as enuie, two common euils, the one of Censure, the other of Obliuion. </p>

        <p>First, for the Scene, was drawne a Landtschape, consisting of small woods, and here and there a voide place filld with huntings; which falling, an artificiall Sea was seene to shoote forth, as if it flowed to the land, raised with waues, which seemed to mooue, and in some places the billow to breake, as imitating that orderly disorder, which is common in nature.

From their backs were borne out certaine light pieces of Taffata, as if carried by the winde, and their Musique made out of wreathed shels. Behinde these, a paire of Sea-Maides, for song, were as conspicuously seated; betweene which, two great Sea-horses (as bigge as the life) put forth themselues; the one mounting aloft, &amp; writhing his head from the other, which seemed to sinck forwards; so intended for variation, &amp; that the <pb xml:id="ep000105-003-b"/>Figure behind, might come of better: <ref target="A04643-e100200-b">g </ref>

        <p>NIGER, in forme and colour of an Aethiope; his haire, and rare beard curled, shadowed with a blew, and bright mantle: his front, neck, and wrists adorned with Pearle, and crowned, with an artificiall wreath of Cane, and Paper-rush. </p>

        <p>The Masquers were placed in a great concaue shell, like mother of Pearle, curiously made to moue on those waters, and rise with the billow; the top therof was stuck with a cheu'rō of lights, which, indented to the proportion of the shell, strooke a glorious beame vpon them, as they were seated, one aboue another: so that they were all seene, but in an extrauagant order. </p>
        <p>On sides of the shell, did swim sixe huge Sea-monsters, varied in their shapes, and dispositions, bearing on their backs the twelue Torch bearers; who were planted there in seuerall graces; so as the backs of some were seene; some in purfle, or side; others in face; &amp; all hauing their lights burning out of Whelks, or Murex shels. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000105-004-a"/>
        <p>The attire of the Masquers was alike, in all, without difference: the colours, Azure, and Siluer; but returned on the top with a scrole and antique dressing of Feathers, and Iewels interlaced with ropes of Pearle. And, for the front, eare, neck, and wrists, the ornament was of the most choise and orient Pearle; best setting of from the black. </p>
        <p>For the Light bearers, Sea-greene, waued about the skirts with gold and siluer their hayre loose, and flowing, gyrlanded with Sea-grasse, and that stuck with branches of Corall. </p>
        <p>These thus presented, the Scene behind, seemed a vast Sea (and vnited with this that flowed forth) from the terminaton, or horizon of which (being the leuell of the State, which was placed in the vpper end of the Hall) was drawne, by the lines of Prospectiue, the whole worke shooting downewards, from the eye; which decorum made it more conspicuous, and caught the eye a far of with a wandring beauty. To which was added an obscure and cloudy night-piece, that made the whole set of. So much for the bodily part. Which was of Maister YNIGO IONES his designe, and act. </p>
        <p>By this, one of the Tritons, with the two Sea-Maides, began to sing to the others lowd Musique, their voyces being a tenor, and two trebles. </p>

In these Squares the sixteene Masquers were plac'd by couples: behind them, in the center of the Throne was a tralucent Pillar, shining with seuerall colour'd lights, that reflected on their backs. From the top of which Pillar went seuerall arches to the Pilasters, that sustained the roofe of the Throne, which was likewise adorn'd with lights, and gyrlonds; And betweene the Pilasters, in front, little Cupids in <pb xml:id="ep000105-014-b"/>flying posture, wauing of wreaths, and lights, bore vp the Coronice: ouer which were placed eight Figures, representing the Elements of Beauty; which aduanced vpon the Ionick, and being females, had the Corinthian order.

        <p>The colours of the Masquers were varied; the one halfe in Orenge-tawny, and Siluer: the other in Sea-greene, and Siluer. The bodies and short skirts of White, and Gold, to both. </p>
        <p>The habite, and dressing (for the fashion) was most curious, and so exceeding in riches, as the Throne wheron they sat, seem'd to be a Mine of light, stroake from their iewells, &amp; their garments. </p>
        <p>This Throne, (as the whole Iland mou'd forward, on the water,) had a circular motion of it owne, imitating that which we cal Motum mundi, from the East to the West, or the right to the left side. For so Hom. Ilia. M. vnderstands by <seg xml:lang="unk">δεξιὰ</seg>, Orientalia mundi: by <seg xml:lang="unk">ἀριστερὰ</seg>, Occidentalia. The <pb xml:id="ep000105-016-b"/>steps, wheron the Cupids sate, had a motion contrary, with Analogy, ad motum Planetarum, from the West to the East: both which turned with their seuerall lights. And with these three varied Motions, at once, the whole Scene shot it selfe to the Land. </p>
        <p>Aboue which, the Moone was seene in a Siluer Chariot, drawne by Virgins, to ride in the cloudes, and hold them greater light: with the Signe Scorpio, and the Character, plac'd before her. </p>
        <p>The order of this Scene was carefully, and ingeniously dispos'd; and as happily put in act (for the Motions) by the Kings Master Carpenter. The Paynters, I must needes say, (not to belie them) lent small colour to any, to attribute much of the spirit of these things to their pen'cills. But that must not bee imputed a crime either to the inuention, or designe. </p>
        <p>Here the loude Musique ceas'd; and the Musitians, which were placed in the Arbors, came forth through the Mazes, to the other Land: singing this full Song, iterated in the closes by two Eccho's, rising out of the Fountaines. </p>
