            <p>Were't not uncivil to get up a Horse-back before you, I would convince you strait; nay, I did think I should be wonder'd at by you all, as much as an Owl is amongst Birds: Very like now if I were in love with any one of you three, though I were on Horse-back, a kind look might dismount me again; but I thank fate I ne're had that perpetration of the heart; yet a Disease— as malignant and as catching as the Plague; and Reigns as the Plague does altogether in London: So that for my future health i'le retire into the Countrey for Air, and there Hunt and Hawk, Eat and sleep so sound, that I will never dream of a woman, or any part about her— This resolution of mine has made me turn Poet, therefore before I go, you shall hear a Song called my farewell to London and women, boy sing the Song. </p>
