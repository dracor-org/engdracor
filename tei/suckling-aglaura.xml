              <l>I'Ve thought upon't; and cannot tell which way </l>
              <l>Ought I can say now, should advance the Play. </l>
              <l>For Playes are either good, or bad; the good, </l>
              <l>(If they doe beg) beg to be understood. </l>
              <l>And in good faith, that has as bold a sound, </l>
              <l>As if a beggar should aske twentie pound. </l>
              <l>&#8212; Men have it not about them: </l>
              <l>Then (Gentlemen) if rightly understood, </l>
              <l>The bad doe need lesse Prologue than the good: </l>
              <l>For if it chance the Plot be lame, or blinde, </l>
              <l>Ill cloath'd, deform'd throughout, it needs must finde </l>
              <l>Compassion,&#8212; It is a beggar without Art:&#8212; </l>
              <l>But it fals out in penny worths of Wit, </l>
              <l>As in all bargaines else. Men ever get </l>
              <l>All they can in; will have London measure, </l>
              <l>A handful over in their verie pleasure. </l>
              <l>And now yee have't; hee could not well deny'ee, </l>
              <l>And I dare sweare hee's scarce a saver by yee. </l>

            <lg>
              <head>Prologue to the Court. </head>
              <l>THose common passions, hopes, and feares, that still, </l>
              <l>The Poets first and then the Prologues fill </l>
              <l>In this our age, hee that writ this, by mee, </l>
              <l>Protests against as modest foolerie. </l>
              <l>Hee thinks it an odd thing to be in paine, </l>
              <l>For nothing else, but to be well againe. </l>
              <l>Who writes to feare is so; had hee not writ; </l>
              <l>You nere had been the Iudges of his wit; </l>
              <l>And when hee had, did hee but then intend </l>
              <l>To please himselfe, hee sure might have his end </l>
              <l>Without th'expence of hope, and that hee had </l>
              <l>That made this Play, although the Play be bad. </l>
              <l>Then Gentlemen be thriftie, save your doomes </l>
              <l>For the next man, or the next Play that comes; </l>
              <l>For smiles are nothing, where men doe not care, </l>
              <l>And frownes as little, where they need not feare. </l>

              <l>Yet not to Majestie: that were to bring </l>
              <l>His feares to be, but for the Queene and King, </l>
              <l>Not for your selves; and that hee dares not say: </l>
              <l>Y'are his Soveraignes another way: </l>
              <l>Your soules are Princes, and you have as good </l>
              <l>A title that way, as yee have by blood </l>
              <l>To governe, and here your powers more great </l>
