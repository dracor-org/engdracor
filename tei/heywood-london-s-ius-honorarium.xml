        <p>
          <hi>Right Honorable</hi>, </p>
        <p>IT was the speech of a Learned and graue Philosopher the Tutor and Counseler to the Emperour <foreign xml:lang="lat">Gratianus, Pulerius multo parari, quam creari nobilem. </foreign>More faire and famous it is to be made, then to be borne Noble, For that Honour is to be most Honored, which is purchast by merrit, not crept into by descent; For you; whose goodnesse, hath made you thus great. I make my affectionate presentment of this annuall Celebration, concerning which: (without flattery be it spoken) there is nothing so much as mentioned (much lesse enforced) in this your <hi>Ius honorarium</hi>, which rather commeth not short, then any way exceedeth the hope and expectation which is now vpon you▪ and therefore worthily was your so free Election, (without either emulation, or competitorship conferd <pb xml:id="ep000071-003-a"/>vpon you▪ since of you it may be vndeniably spoken: that none euer in your place was more sufficient or able, any cause whatsoeuer shall be brought before you, more truly to discerne; being apprehended more aduisedly to dispose, being digested, more maturely to despatch. After this short tender of my seruice vnto you, I humbly take my leaue, with this sentence borrowed from <foreign xml:lang="lat">Seneca Decet timeri Magistratum, at plus diligi. </foreign>
        </p>
        <p>Your Lordships in all obseruance, </p>

        <head>❧ To the Right Worshipfull <hi>Samuell Cranmer</hi>, and <hi>Henry Pratt</hi>, the two Sheriffs of the Honourable Citty of <hi>London, Lately Elected</hi>. </head>
        <p>Right Worshipfull, </p>
        <p>THe cheife Magistrats next vnto the Lord Maior are the two sheriffes, the name Sherife implyeth as much as the Reeue and Gouernour of a Sheare, for Reene: is <hi>Graue Count </hi>or Earle (for so saith Master Verstigan:) and these, were of like authority with the Censors, who were reputed in the prime and best ranke amongst the Magistrates of Rome? They were so cal'd a Cessendo, of ceasing, for they set a rate vpon euery mans estate: registring their names, and placing them in a fit century: A second part of their Office consisted in the reforming of maners, as hauing power to inquire into euery mans life and carriage. The Embleame of which Authority was their <hi>Tirgula censoria </hi>borne before them: they are (by others) resembled to the Tribunes of the people, and these are cal'd <foreign xml:lang="lat">Sacro Sancti</foreign>, whose persons might not be 〈◊〉, nor their names any way scandaliz'd, for whosoever was proued to be a delinquent in either, was held to be <foreign xml:lang="lat">Homo sacer; </foreign>an excommunicated person, and hee that slew him was not liable vnto any iudgement: their Houses stand open continually, not onely for Hospitality, but for a Sanctuary to all such as were distrest: neither was it lawfull for them to be absent from the Colledge one whole day together, during their Yeare. Thus you see <pb xml:id="ep000071-004-a"/>how neere the Dignities of this Citty, come neere to these in Rome, when it was most slourishing. The first Sheriffes that bore the name and office in this Citty, were <hi>Peter Duke</hi>, and <hi>Thomas Neale</hi>, Anno 1209. The nouissimi, now in present <hi>Samuell Cranmer </hi>and <hi>Henry Pratt</hi>. Anno 1631. To whom I direct this short Remembrance. </p>
        <p>Your Worships euer Attendant, </p>

        <head>LONDONS <hi>Ius Honorarium</hi>. </head>
        <p>WHen Rome was erected: at the first establishing of a common weale, Romulus the founder of it, instituted a prime officer to gouerne the Citty, who was cald <foreign xml:lang="lat">praefectus vrbis, i. </foreign>the praefect of the City, whose vnconroulable authority, had power, not onely to examine, but to determie, all causes &amp; controuersies, &amp; to sit vpon, and censure all delinquents, whether their offences were capitall or criminall: <foreign xml:lang="lat">Intra centesfimum lapidem</foreign>, within an hundred miles of the City, in processe of time the Tarquins being expeld, &amp; the prime soueraignry remaining in the consuls. They (by reason of their forraigne imployments) hauing no leasure to administer Iustice at home, created two cheife officers, the one they cald <hi>praetor vrbanus</hi>, or Maior, the other <foreign xml:lang="lat">per egrinus</foreign>: The first had his iurisdiction, in and ouer the City, the <pb xml:id="ep000071-005-a"/>other excercised his authority meerely vpon strangers. </p>
        <p>The name Praetor is deriued from Preessondo or Praeeundo, from priority of place, which as a learned Roman Author writs, had absolute power ouer all publique and priuat affaires, to make new Lawes, and abolish old, without controwle, or contradiction: His authority growing to that height, that whatsoeuer he decreed or censured in publique, was cald <hi>Ius Honorarium</hi>, the first on whome this dignity was conferd in Rome, was <hi>spur: furius Camillus</hi>, the sonne of Marcus: And the first Praeter or Lord Maior appointed to the Gouernment of the Honorable Citty of London, was <hi>Henry Fitz Allwin</hi>, aduaunced to that Dignity, by King <hi>Iohn, Anno. </hi>1210. so much for the Honor and Antiquity of the name and place, I proceede to the showes. </p>
        <p>
          <q>Vpon the water. </q>
        </p>
        <p>Are two craggy Rockes, plac'd directly opposit, of that distance that the Barges may passe betwixt them: these are full of monsters, as Serpents, Snakes, Dragons, &amp;c. some spitting Fier, others vomiting water, in the bases thereof, nothing to be seene, but the sad relicks of shipwracke in broken Barkes and split Vessels, &amp;c. The one is cald Silla, <pb xml:id="ep000071-005-b"/>the other Charibdis, which is scituate directly against <hi>Messana; Scilla </hi>against Rhegium: and what soever shippe that passeth these Seas, if it keepe not the middle Channell, it is either wrackt upon the one, or devoured by the other; <foreign xml:lang="lat">Medio cutissimus ibit</foreign>. Vpon these Rocks are placed the Syrens, excellent both in voyce and Instrument: They are three in number, <hi>Telsipio, Jligi, Aglaosi: </hi>or as others will have them called, Parthenope, skilfull in musicke; Leucosia, upon the winde Instrument; Ligni, upon the Harpe. The morrall intended by the Poets, that whosoever shall lend an attentive eare to their musicke, is in great danger to perish; but he that can warily avoyd it by stopping his eares against their inchantment, shall not onely secure themselves, but bee their ruine: This was made good in Vlisses the speaker, who by his wisedome and pollicy not onely preserved himselfe and his people, but was the cause that they from the rocks cast themselves headlong into the Sea. In him is personated a wise and discreete Magistrate. </p>
        <lg>
          <head>Vlisses <hi>his speech</hi>. </head>
          <l>BEhold great Magistrate, on either hand </l>

          <l>Two dangerous rocks, your safety to ingage, </l>
          <l>Boasting of nought save shipwrake spoyle and strage. </l>
          <l>This Sylla, that Charibdis, (dangerous both) </l>
          <l>Plac't in the way you rowe to take your oath. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Yet though a thousand monsters yawne and gape </l>
          <l>To ingurdge and swallow you, ther's way to scape; </l>
          <l>Vlisses by his wisedome found it, steare </l>
          <l>You by his Compasse, and the way lyes cleare, </l>
          <l>Will you know how? looke upward then; and sayle </l>
          <l>By the signe Libra, that Celestiall scale, </l>
          <l>In which (some write) the Sunne at his creation </l>
          <l>First shone; and is to these times a relation </l>
          <l>Of Divine Justice: It in justice shind, </l>
          <l>Doe you so (Lord) and be like it divind. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Keepe the even Channell, and be neither swayde, </l>
          <l>To the right hand nor left, and so evade </l>
          <l>Malicious envie (never out of action,) </l>
          <l>Smooth visadgd flattery, and blacke mouthd detraction, </l>
          <l>Sedition, whisprings, murmuring, private hate, </l>
          <l>All ambushing, the godlike Magistrate. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>About these rockes and quick sands Syrens haunt, </l>
          <l>One singes connivence, th'other would inchaunt </l>
          <l>With partiall sentence; and a third ascribes, </l>
          <l>In pleasing tunes, aright to gifts and bribes; </l>
          <l>Sweetning the eare, and every other sence, </l>
          <l>That place, and office, may with these dispence. </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000071-006-b"/>
          <l>But though their tones be sweete, and shrill their notes, </l>
          <l>They come from foule brests, and inpostum'd throats, </l>
          <l>Sea monsters they be stiled, but much (nay more, </l>
          <l>'Tis to be doubted,) they frequent the shoare. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Yet like Vlisses, doe but stop your eare </l>
          <l>To their inchantments, with an heart sincere; </l>
          <l>They fayling to indanger your estate, </l>
          <l>Will from the rocks themselves precipitate. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg>
          <l>Proceede then in your blest Inauguration, </l>
          <l>And celebrate this Annuall Ovation; </l>
          <l>Whilst you nor this way, nor to that way leane, </l>
          <l>But shunne th' extreames, to keepe the golden meane. </l>
          <l>This glorious City, Europs chiefest minion, </l>
          <l>Most happy in so great a Kings dominion: </l>

        <p>The third show by Land Presented neere vnto the great Crosse in Cheape-side, beareth the title of the Palace of Honour: A faire and Curious structure archt and Tarrest aboue, on the Top of which standeth Honour, a Glorious presens, and ritchly habited, shee in her speech directed to the right Honorable: the Lord Maior, discouers all the true and direct wayes to attaine vnto her as, first: A King: Eyther by succession or Election. </p>
        <p>A Souldier, by valour and martiall Discipline </p>
        <p>A Churchman by Learning and degrees in scooles </p>
        <p>A Statesman by Trauell and Language &amp;c. </p>
        <p>A Lord Maior by Commerce and Trafficke both </p>
        <p>By Sea and Land, by the Inriching of the Kingdome, and Honour of our Nation. </p>
        <p>The Palace of Honour is thus governed </p>
        <p>Industry Controwler, his Word Negotior Charity Steward, the Word Miserior. <pb xml:id="ep000071-010-a"/>Liberality Treasurer, the Word <hi>Largior, Innocence </hi>and <hi>Deuotion Henchmen </hi>the words. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Patior: Precor</foreign>. And so of the rest, and according to this Pallace of Honour is facioned not onely the management of the whole Citty in generall: but the House and Family of the <hi>Lord Maior </hi>in particuler. </p>
        <p>Before in the Front of this pallace is seated Saint Katherin, the Lady and Patronesse of this Worshipfull Society of whom I will giue you this short Character, the name it selfe imports in the Originall. <foreign xml:lang="lat">Omnis ruina</foreign>, which (as some interpret it) is as much as to say, the fall and ruin of all the workes of the Diuell: Others deriue the word from Catena, a Chaine wherein all cheife Vertues and Graces are concatinated and link't together, so much for her name. </p>
        <p>For her birth, shee was lineally descended from the Roman Emperours, the daughter of Costus the sonne of Constantine which Costns was Crowned King of Armenia, for Constantine hauing conquered <pb xml:id="ep000071-010-b"/>that Kingdome, grew Inamored of the Kings Daughter by whom he had Issue, this Costus who after succeeded his Grand Father. </p>
        <p>Constantine after the death of his first Wife made an expedition from Roome, and hauing Conquered this Kingdome of Great Britaine: he tooke to his Second Wife Helena, which Helena was she that found the Crosse vpon which the Sauiour of the World was Crucified, &amp;c. </p>
        <p>Costus Dying whilst Katherine was yet young, and shee being all that Time huing in Famogosta, (a cheife City) because shee was there Proclaimed and Crowned was called Queene of Famogosta, she liued and dyed a Virgin and a Martyr vnder the Tiranny of Maxentius, whose Empresse, with many other great &amp; eminent persons she had before conuerted to the Faith. So much for her character Her speech to the Lord Maior as followeth. </p>
