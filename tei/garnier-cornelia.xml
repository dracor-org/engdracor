        <head>The Argument. </head>
        <p>CORNELIA the Daughter of Metellus Scipio, a young Romaine Lady, (as much accomplisht with the graces of the bodie, &amp; the vertues of the minde as euer any was,) was first married to young Crassus, who died with his Father, in the disconfiture of the Romains against the Parthians; Afterward she tooke to second husbande Pompey the great, who (three yeeres after) vpon the first fiers of the ciuill warres betwixt him &amp; Caesar, sent her fro thence to Mitilen, there to attende the incertaine successe of those affaires. And when he sawe that hee was vanquisht at Pharsalia, returnd to find her out, &amp; carrie her with him into Egipt, where his purpose was to haue re-enforc'd a newe Armie, and giue a second assault to Caesar. </p>
        <p>In this voyage, hee was murdred by Achillas and Septimius the Romaine before her eyes, and in the presence of his young Sonne Sextus; and some other Senators his friends. After which, shee retyred herselfe to Rome. But Scipio her Father, (beeing made <pb xml:id="ep000023-004-a"/>Generall of those that suruiued after the battaile) assembled new forces, and occupied the greater part of Afrique, allying himselfe to Iuba King of Numidia. Against all whom, Caesar (after he had ordred the affayres of Egipt and the state of Rome) in the end of Winter marched. And there (after many light encounters) was a fierce and furious battaile giuen amongst them, neere the walls of Tapsus. Where Scipio seeing himselfe subdued, and his Armie scattered, he betooke himselfe with some small troope, to certaine shippes which he had caused to stay for him. </p>
        <p>Thence he sailed towarde Spayne, where Pompeys Faction commaunded, and where a suddaine tempest tooke him on the Sea, that draue him backe to Hippon a Towne in Affrique at the deuotion of Caesar, where (lying at anchor) he was assailed, beaten &amp; assaulted by the aduerse Fleete; And for hee woulde not fall aliue into the hands of his so mightie Enemie, hee stabd himselfe, and suddainly leapt ouer boorde into the Sea, and there dyed. </p>
        <p>Caesar (hauing finished these warres, and quietly reduc'd the Townes and places there-about to his obedience) return'd to Rome in tryumph for his victories; Where this most faire and miserable Ladie, hauing ouer-mourn'd the death of her deere husband, <pb xml:id="ep000023-004-b"/>and vnderstanding of these crosse euents and haples newes of Affrique, together with the pitteous manner of her Fathers ende, shee tooke (as shee had cause) occasion to redouble both her teares and lamentations: wherewith she closeth the Catastrophe of this theyr Tragedie. </p>

          <l>For Rome thou now resemblest a Ship, </l>

          <l>When foming billowes feele the Northern blasts: </l>

          <l>(Which both the world and Fortune heapt on him,) </l>
          <l>Adorne and grace his graceles Enemy? </l>
          <l>Or see the wealth that Pompey gain'd in warre, </l>
          <l>Sold at a pike, and borne away by strangers? </l>
          <l>Dye, rather die Cornelia; And (to spare </l>
          <l>Thy worthles life that yet must one day perrish,) </l>
          <l>Let not those Captains vainlie lie inter'd, </l>
          <l>Or Caesar triumph in thine infamie, </l>
          <l>That wert the wife to th'one, and th'others daughter. </l>
          <l>But if I die before I haue entomb'd, </l>
          <l>My drowned Father in some Sepulcher, </l>
          <pb xml:id="ep000023-048-a"/>
          <l>Who will performe that care in kindnes for me? </l>
          <l>Shall his poore wandring lymbs lie stil tormented, </l>
          <l>Tost with the salte waues of the wasteful Seas? </l>
          <l>No louely Father, and my deerest husband, </l>
          <l>Cornelia must liue, (though life she hateth) </l>
          <l>To make your Tombes, &amp; mourne vpon your hearses. </l>
          <l>Where (languishing,) my famous faithful teares </l>
          <l>May trickling bathe your generous sweet cynders. </l>
          <l>And afterward (both wanting strength and moysture, </l>
          <l>Fulfilling with my latest sighes and gasps, </l>
          <l>The happie vessels that enclose your bones,) </l>
          <l>I will surrender my surcharged life. </l>
          <l>And (when my soule Earths pryson shall forgoe,) </l>
          <l>Encrease the number of the ghosts be-low. </l>
