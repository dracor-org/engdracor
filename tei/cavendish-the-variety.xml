          <p>You shall pardon me, there are sets of them, as there are of Fidlers; there is first a set of Court Jeerers, spruce half-witted men, confident, and fierce in their opinions; these are men that make themselves musick, and their cloths make roome for their wit; and go before in all companies: Then there is the town Jeerers, like Hoboyes or Waites of the City, that think they are wise when they are loud, and make a noise when they come to Plaies, to distract the next mans understanding. There are Jeerers at time of the yeer that go down into the Countrey, and infect Wakes, and Faires, and the Sizes, with their impudence, with which they save charges, and are never without the name of a great Lord, to whom they are cosin Germane. </p>

Amongst other ornaments, Ribbands challenge no meane place, the variety, and blason of these, I have elsewhere examined. For your finest Laces, the Angel in Cheape, but they must be dearer then others, because they come in Coaches, for pride or stateliness in any thing adds charges. Touching Gloves, might I advise, I would have a few selected Ladies, to procure some ingenious Gentleman at a reasonable pension to lye leiger for them at Rome for Frangepane Gloves, and such other correspondent things as may be of moment and great consequence to your Ladyships: But then I must advertise, and most seriously, that he may be a man of parts, and somewhat smelling toward the Roman Wash, that he may give you intelligence of that State, and humours of the Cardinals, or those that pretend to it, be they little or great, for this concernes the state Ladies here: For your swarthie Mountebanke Italian, he utters sophisticated Holborne Gloves for Frangepane, Essex Cheese for Parmesan, rotten post for sweet powder, pickled white Leather for Mushromes, and cozens more with his broken English, then the wits can get honestly with their best language. </p>

For Aprons, plaine Holland is most becomming, starch'd Lawne was in Queen Elizabeths time, and will not endure rumpling, every thing must be squar'd by use and elegance; but for your white Shoes, rich Roses, light-coloured silk Stockings, and such variety below staires, they are great Inducers, as a learned man told me, (I will not say a Divine) for Love, most excellent Ladies, doth sometimes ascend, as well as descend. </p>
          <p>But still remember Ladies, that your Fanne be so little, as not to lose the least smirke, or grace <pb n="16" xml:id="ep000654-062-a"/>of your countenance for it, for then being so small, when you put it to your face, some Courtiers may take it for a black patch. Then for your oaths, I protest is out of fashion, I professe for a Justice of Peaces Wise, I vow too masculine, yfaith for a Chambermaid, Introth for a Landerer, As you hope to live, too like a Prayer; Never stir, would disadvantage a Lady many waies, besides visits; For the active wenches of the time, May they be damn'd eternally, and lose all their designs if it be not so; Upon my honour sounds well, which in a great Lady can never be forfeited if she be in love, for great women have their privilege of Nobility, and can never be forsworn like the Common people. </p>
