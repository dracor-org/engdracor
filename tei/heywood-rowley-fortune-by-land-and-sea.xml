              <p>This being the wedding day of my Masters eldest Son, I expect rare cheer. As first, the great spic'd Cake to go in, Cake-bread fashion, drawn out with Currans, the Jealious Formety must put on his yellow hose agen, and hot Pies come mincing after, the boyl'd Mutton must swim in a River of stew'd broth, where the channel's made of Prunes. Instead of peables, and prime reasons, and Currans in the stead of checker stones and gravel, to omit Geese and Guls, Ducks and Dotterels Widgins and Woodcocks, of which there will be plenty. At our wedding dinner we shall have the Bride in her tiffety taffeties most sumptuous, and the Bridegroom as wel in brancht Sattin as brancht Rosemary most couragious. Ile in and see them in all their beauty, and give them the Joy, the boon Jour, the Besilus Manus, or to be more vulgar to the Incapable, the God give you good morrow. </p>
