          <salute>Doctor, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>I Am heartily glad that a Person of your Learning and Parts has taken up the Cudgels against the whole College of Physicians; and notwithstanding your great Modesty have <hi>set your Face </hi>against so Learned and Ingenious a Society. I must confess, I have a prety good stock of Confidence my self, and perhaps dare attack any single Person whatever, nay even Mr. Bays himself, but to attack such a Body of Men of Learning and Sense, I must yield is a Task only fit for your Management, who I dare boldly say can rail as bluntly as any Oyster-Wench at Billingsgate. Therefore as you have began to make 'um appear a parcel of Sots, and perjured Villains (as your witty Queries seem to import) I beg the Favour of you to go on <hi>without any Consideration </hi>(as you have done already) and perhaps in time you may prove 'um all Whores, and Rogues, Vagabonds, Persons that had neither Fathers, or Mothers, and what not? For if any can prove it, I believe it must be you, no Body else daring to attempt to prove Matters of so great Consequence, because they want your Learning and Knowledg to go through with it. Take only this Caution, <hi>Dear Doctor</hi>, in the Management of your Affairs: Let not the Multitude of Business distract your Regular Thoughts (your Head being a little out of order sometime) lest you grow apt to forget what you have said of 'um before, <pb xml:id="ep000468-003-a"/>and as you have in the Lump call'd 'um a parcel of Perjur'd Villians, so don't publickly talk and <hi>say that the're about 10, or 12 Honest Fellows amongst 'um. </hi>This w'ont do my Friend; to say they are <hi>all Rogues</hi>, and some of that All are honest Men, is a little Illogical, neither doth it savour much of an University Education, thô it may suit well enough perhaps with Yours. The Irish Evidence that ignorantly swore a Person of Quality into the Popish Plot, thought he could make no juster Retaliation to him than by swearing of him out again. Now if you intend to follow the steps of this worthy Evidence, and as you have stigmatized the Fellows of the College with abundance of hard Names, so to make 'um amends you will endeavour to give 'um as good Characters as Moral Honesty and Christianity obliges you to do; I think you propose a fair method of Reconciliation, and perhaps even against their own Inclinations, out of meer Compassion, and not respect to your Merit, they may vouchsafe to admit you into their Society. This Advice, my Friend, I think is very seasonable, and were I a Member of the Colledge I would endeavour all I could to procure your Admittance upon your Submission: but if you will still continue in an obstinate and perverse Humour of railing, I think you will justly forfeit that good Opinion which Indifferent Judges have of the Hardship of your Case (if any such there were) and be fit only to be bray'd in that necessary Instrument of your former Profession, a Mortar. These are the real Sentiments of, </p>

            <speaker>Dr. Matter? </speaker>
            <p>Let me tell you, Mr. Trueman, I have been a Physician in London almost Forty Years, and I never knew so little Business to do in all my Life-Time. 'Tis a <hi>Damnable Healthy </hi>Town grown since I knew it first. I have known the Time when I could go out and pick up 10 or 12 l. in a Morning, come Home to Dinner and empty'd, so out again after to Replenish. <pb n="10" xml:id="ep000468-004-a"/>But I am sure the Times now are so hard that if my good Father had not conveniently step'd aside, I could no more have brag'd of living by my Wit, as some Men do, than the D— s of N— can of her Chastity. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ep000468-tr" xml:id="ep000468-e880">
            <speaker>Tr. </speaker>
            <p>Pray Doctor, not too severe. Why Damnable Healthy? Do you wish the Nation a Plague, or an Epidemick Sickness, purely to promote your own private Interest? Such Expressions, methinks, become not Men of your Education, nor indeed savour much of Religion. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ep000468-dr" xml:id="ep000468-e910">
            <speaker>Dr. </speaker>
            <p>What do you talk of that to a Physician? I thought you had known the World better than so. Is not every Body for their own Interest, be Religion what it will? Do's not the greatest Pretenders to Holiness cheat with Yea, and Nay, as oft (if not oftner) as he that says <hi>Dam me it cost me so much, </hi>when he knows that he Lies at the same time he Swears? and all this to promote a Trade. All the Excuse being, <hi>a Man must live</hi>, Customers always expect some Abatement of what we ask. Nay I have known an Apothecary set down 4 <hi>s. 6 d. </hi>for a Specifick Bolus, when it has been about a Farthing-worth of Crabs-Eyes in a little London-Treacle. </p>
          </sp>
          <sp who="#ep000468-tr" xml:id="ep000468-e1000">
            <speaker>Tr. </speaker>
            <p>Ay, Doctor, that may be. That's 4 s. for the Word Specifick, and 6 d. for the Bolus. Pretty cheap on my Word. But this is not to the purpose to explain what you mean by Damnable Healthy. </p>

          <sp who="#ep000468-dr" xml:id="ep000468-e1050">
            <speaker>Dr. </speaker>
            <p>Why, Sir, are you always teazing me to explain my meaning? Then if you will have it, I'll tell you. You know that every Body wishes well to themselves; now Health is the greatest Enemy to our Interest and Profit that can be. </p>

            <p>Good Mr. Trueman don't make Reflections upon our Profession, when the Apothecaries after a long Siege have batter'd down the Walls, then the World says we destroy'd the Town; what reason is there in this? </p>

            <speaker>Dr. </speaker>
            <p>No, no. But to go on. I call that Damnable Health (thô I know it bears another Sense) when the Sickness is not great enough to require the skill of a Physician, but every ignorant Apothecary assumes the Cure, and pretends to know more than the learned'st Physician of us all. </p>
          </sp>

            <speaker>Dr. </speaker>
            <p>Yes, but I would, by all means, only let 'um do their part in their own Sphere, and within their own Limits or Bounds. For when Men have no lawful Authority to Act, that Action may be call'd Damnable, that is, such an Action as may justly be condemned by all Wise-men. Now 'tis plain that the Apothecaries have no lawful Commission to do what they do often, and consequently they may be justly condemn'd for doing such an Action. So that if the Patient dies under such an one's Hands, the Law judges him a bold Empyrick; and all Men of Reason, the Patient a Fool, especially if he were able to pay. </p>

            <p>Nay, Doctor, now you are grown Grave. We will let this Nicety of examining Words alone; I see you are angry with the Apothecaries for invading your Province. However, you have one Comfort left that your Good Father Broke, and left you an Estate. </p>

I have perswaded my Patients, that they did not well understand their Distemper; so have brought in another who has <hi>swingingly dos'd 'um</hi>. I could tell you of a Sir Harry that paid an 100 l. for Physick in six Weeks, and I accepted it, being a Friend, without requiring one Penny for my own Fees.— You don't know the Mystery of Trade. </p>

            <p>MR. Trueman, methinks 'twas a pretty Diversion yesterday, to hear the Apothecary brag of his Skill in Surgery and Physick; I could not imagine what he had to set up with, but a large stock of Impudence: I know all his Medicines in his Shop did not cost above Fifty Pound, and in Six Weeks Time has he made an hundred Pound of one part of it? Such Reflections as these wou'd make a Man burn his Books, and curse the Gentility of his Education. It seems indeed wonder to me, that so many Gentlemen who serve in Parliament, and have oft-times many Younger Sons to provide for, do not find out a way to suppress these griping Empyricks, and Quacks, that their Children may be the better able to support themselves in a Genteel Profession, answerable to the Expence they have been at in their Education.

            <p>Well, Tom, my Advice to a Patient is as soon as he is Ill, to send for some Doctor of the Lower Rank, of whose Learning and Skill in Physick he has an Opinion; and in case he grow worse, to send for one of greater Fame, Reputation, and Vogue in the World to joyn in Consult: For the Diligence of the one, who has less Fame, and Vogue in the World (tho' perhaps equal in Learning and Skill really, tho' not thought so in the Eye of the World) may, and oft do's make amends for the supposed greater Skill of the other Physitian, by which means the Patient may more reasonably, and upon juster grounds expect a Cure. Besides the Hurry, and Multitude of Business that distracts the Heads of Men in great Practice, and makes 'um either forget what they did formerly in the like Cases, or at least write but cursorily, and as they say, iust for their Fee, would by this means be a little tempered; and by the constant Attendance and Observation of the Diligent Physician, the supposed Great Man may be put in mind of using some more proper Medicines for the Patient, which perhaps he would otherwise forget. These, Gentlemen, are my real Sentiments. </p>

            <p>Mr. Pestle, by your leave a little. How did all the Apothecaries learn to make Medicines at first? 'Tis very probable that Men of Learning, Study and Industry (such which the World has call'd Physicians) first found out the use of Herbs, Minerals, &amp;c. Out of these, proportionably mixed, formed Compound Medicines; and their Prescriptions taught the Apothecaries the general use of these Medicines: Which made the Apothecaries use <hi>these Weapons first formed against all Diseases </hi>(as I beg leave to call 'um) <hi>peculiarly against the First Inventor</hi>, to destroy him Root and Branch if possible. Like the Spaniards in the West-Indies, who thought it good Policy (tho 'twas neither Honesty nor Christianity) to destroy the Natives wholly; to make the Possession of their Countrey more quiet and secure. The Gentility of their Profession, I confess, has been a great hindrance to them in reaping those Advantages as they might (and with more Honesty than any of ye) otherwise have done. </p>

            <p>E'en let 'um be Genteel still. I don't think 'um indeed such Fools, as that they cannot make Medicines if they will; but why can't they keep their Learning and Gentility to themselves, and let us alone? </p>

            <p>O, Sir, I am glad you allow 'um to be capable of learning to make Medicines if they please. Now, Mr. Pestle, to tell you the plain Truth, I hear they have actually made several good Medicines at the College, and continue so to do; neither do I think it so very difficult to understand <pb n="36" xml:id="ep000468-016-a"/>making Compound Medicines, and prizing of them: For if I know the Price of every Simple, sure 'tis very easy for me to guess what the whole Mass cost, and so consequently by a farther Calculation tell you what an Ounce, half an Ounce, or a Dram of that Mass may be sold for: Thus I have made it plain that they can make Medicines, and prize 'um too. </p>

Besides, if ever they have bought good out of your Shops, (and yours is always right prime good, ye know) or have made good, they may, and I believe can make the like again. </p>

By which means the Doctors will be sure to have such good Medicines, and so well prepared as to rely on them, not to be sophisticated; or, for want of any one prescribed, to be supply'd by another in the room of it, as you Apothecaries oft do: If you han't one Thing, you in your mighty Wisdom will put in another in the room of it; so that the Physician may prescribe till Dooms-day, and the Patient will be never the better, if ye substitute what Medicines ye please, and after that put what Prices ye please. </p>
