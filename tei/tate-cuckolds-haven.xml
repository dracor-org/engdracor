        <head>TO THE HONOURABLE COLONEL Edmund Ashton. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>AS you will find the following Scenes drawn from the Stores of that great Master Ben, I hope you will think the Contrivance no ill Imitation: That they had no better Success on the Stage, was for this Reason: The principal Part (on which the Diversion depended) was, by Accident, disappointed of Mr. Nokes's Performance, for whom it was design'd, and only proper; which caus'd a Retrenchment of whole Scenes in the Action, that are in this Copy inserted. As it here lies <pb xml:id="ep000766-003-a"/>together, if the Plot be not too regular for Farce, and ought not rather to have been call'd Comedy, I dare trust the Reader for the rest. Notwithstanding all the Disadvantages in its Appearance on the Stage, you were pleased, Sir, to discover some Beauties through the Cloud. However, I am not so much concern'd for a Work of this Nature, as to impose the Protection of it upon you. My Ambition in this Address, is, to owne my good fortune in your Acquaintance, and Advantages from thence, as to Nobler Species of Poetry. I speak not with relation to any Essays of my own, but for improvement of my Skill in the best Latin Poets. When <hi>Ben Johnson </hi>was inform'd, that a certain Person had done him Injury, he cry'd out with Indignation, <hi>I made the Ingrateful Man understand </hi>Horace. Obligations of this kind, indeed, are unvaluable. I presume (Sir) I could before pretend to a Grammarians, or Commentators knowledge; but this was understanding like a Dutchman: </p>

          <l>From whom, the Author's more obscure become, </l>
          <l>The Fogs of Holland cloud the Wit of Rome; </l>
          <l>While these the Vehicle of Words essay, </l>
          <l>The subtle Spirit flies unseen away. </l>
        </lg>
        <p>They understood the Words, but you the Poet. Your Judgment does not terminate in what is express'd, but takes in the whole Scope of Fancy, and feels the flame of the Poet, while he labour'd with Inspiration. In short (Sir) you make their very Spirit visible; and with piercing sight discover those Beauties, which their Art threw off to such distance, that they were not discern'd by Vulgar Eyes. The World must allow me to pay this Acknowledgment: It is what I heard own'd (while a Stranger to you) by a <ref target="A62863-e400-b">* </ref>

        <p>Of many Obligations that endear his Memory to me, the Opportunity of your Acquaintance was not the least; while I have heard you discant together on your beloved Authours, Time seem'd to me to be revolv'd, and I thought my self in the Court of Augustus. I think the Nation is duly grateful for what he has transplanted from their Language, though sparing of those Favours. We likewise know, Sir, that you have not fate down with the bare knowledge of those ancient Roman Treasures, without giving some parts of them the English Stamp. And to hoard them in Secresy, is injury to your Country. It was always thought the Perfection of an Honourable person, to be an Accomplisht Courtier, Souldier, and Scholar. All which Capacities are (Sir) without Complement, ascrib'd to You. Nor may we omit, that Justice, Courtesie, and Condescention, which (in relation to Inferiours) compleat <pb xml:id="ep000766-004-b"/>the Character of a Gentleman. As a just Respect on these Worthy Accounts is rendred to you by all Persons, it is by none more sincerely paid, than by, </p>

          <l>But we must have both Dam and Devil too? </l>
          <l>First, with the Old Serpent plagu'd of Associations, </l>
          <l>And since, with viler Spawn of Declarations: </l>
          <l>Whose poyson such Distraction cou'd create, </l>
          <l>That Scyth-men listed to Mow down the State. </l>

          <l>Have Patience, Sirs, next bout we'll shew, if luck hold, </l>
          <l>What's strange indeed, ----- an Alderman no Cuckold: </l>
          <l>A Privilege for serious Play too great, </l>
          <l>But Farce has Privilege, Farce, our last Retreat: </l>
          <l>For as kept Misses, when their Keepers tire, </l>
          <l>With some new slight, revive the pall'd desire; </l>
          <l>So Poets banking th' old Roads of the Stage, </l>
          <l>Bring Farce to tickle up th' Enervate Age: </l>
          <l>Poets, and Whores, you equally shou'd dread; </l>
          <l>A-like infections, where their Venom's spread. </l>
          <l>What's Poetry, but 〈◊〉 Clap i'th' Head? </l>
          <l>Yet Clapt Gallant sometimes gets Sound agen, </l>
          <l>No Cure for Gonorrhoea of the Pen </l>
          <l>The Parallel holds further, as I guess, </l>
          <l>There's Whores for Need, and Whores for Wantonness; </l>
          <l>So there's Sale Poetry, Poetry of Lord, </l>
          <l>Worth just as much, as his sweet Lordships Word. </l>
          <l>One Word more from the Authour, I must say, </l>
          <l>He once hit Farce, whate'er he has done to day. </l>
