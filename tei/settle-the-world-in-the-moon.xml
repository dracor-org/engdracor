        <head>TO Christopher Rich. Esq. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THE Feast being made under your own Roof, I cannot choose so proper a Patron for this Entertainment, as your Self. This Performance, I confess, wants an Universal Protection: For if Industry, Labour, and Expence, can deserve a Smile, it stands high for a Favourite. So Great an Undertaking, I am sure has never been on an English Stage; and I am not Traveller sufficient to make Foreign Comparisons. </p>
        <p>And here I think my self obliged to do the Pencil this Publick Right, to tell the World, That never was such a Pile of Painting rais'd upon so Generous a Foundation; especially under all the Hardships of so backward a Season of the Year (our Misfortune, not Fault.) However, the Undertaker very well knows, he is in the Hands of Honour; and no <pb xml:id="ep000726-003-a"/>ways doubts of a suitable Encouragement, from so much Worth and Justice. </p>
        <p>As for my own part, I stand so highly Indebted for Favours received of You, that I only wish the Present I make You, were much more deserving your Acceptance, to be the worthier Oblation of my Gratitude. </p>
        <p>As to the Entertainment it self, I hope I shall not be vain to say, That the Model of the Scenes of this Play, are something of an Original: I am sure I have removed a long Heap of Rubbish, and thrown away all our old French Lumber, our Clouds of Clouts, and set the Theatrical Paintings at a much fairer Light. And therefore am an humble Suppliant to the Generous Audience, for some Grains of Mercy. </p>
        <p>For as I dare confidently averr, the Prospect of this Stage will put all the old Rags out of Countenance: So I hope the Town will graciously please to pardon the undeserving Scribbler, for some small Merit in the Projector. Otherwise it would be a little too hard to give me that Fate with my Play, as Middleton had with his Pipes, viz. By introducing that Project, as may Enrich my Successors; and at the same time Starve my Self. </p>
        <pb xml:id="ep000726-003-b"/>
        <p>However, my Doom be what it will, yet still I shall carry this Pride along with me, That I have endeavour'd to Please, in spreading so Gay a Table. </p>
        <p>And if this Essay, on the other side, does find Success, it will bring me a double Pleasure; not only in the Gratification of my own Interest, but likewise in the Satisfaction I shall receive, that this publick Acknowledgment of your Goodness, will be so much a more lasting Record of those grateful Tenders, are here made you by, </p>

        <byline>Spoken by a new Girl. </byline>
        <l>THEY say Young Actors on the Stage appear </l>
        <l>At their first Entry, with a trembling Fear. </l>
        <l>And yet, methinks, by all that I can find, </l>
        <l>The Ladies look so gay, and Men so kind; </l>
        <l>That all my trembling Pains are vanish'd quite; </l>
        <l>Are such fine Folks so terrible a Sight? </l>
        <l>All that I see do rather please than fright. </l>
        <l>Then I'll be bold, and tell you I am sent </l>
        <l>To make— Make what?— The Poets Compliment. </l>
        <l>Not I indeed.— Let him e'ne sink or swim; </l>
        <l>Is't fit I should Excuses find for him? </l>
        <l>And be so vain to expect any Grace, </l>
        <l>The very first Time that I shew my Face? </l>
        <l>I must confess I fain his Friend would be, </l>
        <l>But I had rather have You Friends to Me. </l>
        <l>He has, alas! been us'd to Fortune's Frown; </l>
        <l>But if you treat Me Ill, I am undone. </l>
        <l>Alas! I set up with a Stock so small, </l>
        <l>The first Miscarriage wou'd quite ruin all. </l>
        <l>For if I now should break, where must I run? </l>
        <l>Priviledg'd-Places are all quite put down. </l>
        <l>But there's a way for You to help me yet, </l>
        <l>For if I cannot All Your Favours get; </l>
        <l>I hope you'll grant one Thing in my Behalf, </l>
        <l>Let me but have Two-Thirds, and I am safe. </l>

And if she should take a small Snap abroad, to mend her short Com●●ns at Home; thou know'st Shackarel, that every Thing would live; and I am a Man of more Conscience than to keep a poor Thing to starve it. </p>

            <p>Go to the Devil! Oh fye no. Cuckolds go to Heav'n, Shackarel;— and Heav'ns a sweet Place. And as our Parson told me t'other Day, 'tis a very difficult Matter to get to Heav'n, especially with Use upon Use, and Bags upon Bags, with rack'd Rents and screw'd Tenants, and Widows Sighs and Orphans Tears: And above all, the lamentable Out-cry of Stock-jobbing and Bank-Bills; Receipts of good Gold, and Payments of Paper, Shackarel. Then what can I do better, than marry a young Wife to send me to Heav'n, when I shall find it so hard to get thither my self. And therefore <hi>Nolens volens, Nemine contradicente</hi>, I'll marry Jacintha. </p>

        <byline>Spoke by Miss <hi>Dennis Chock</hi>, Dress'd with a great Wig like a Beau. </byline>
        <stage xml:id="ep000726-e35000">She Enters Singing Part of an Old Tune. </stage>

          <l>Gallants, </l>
          <l>THE Author sends me here, to win your Hearts </l>
          <l>With this full Wig, and not his own Deserts; </l>
          <l>For he believes, and I suppose you know, </l>
          <l>There's nothing pleases more than a young Beau. </l>
          <l>But yet the Stage this day has done its best; </l>
          <l>For it has furnish'd out a Miser's Feast: </l>
          <l>And if this Charge and Pains should now be lost, </l>
          <l>'Twere hard to Shipwrack on a Golden Coast. </l>
          <l>But, Gentlemen and Ladies, I must say, </l>
          <l>Since I am chose Champion to defend this Play, </l>
          <l>I'll do't: <stage xml:id="ep000726-e35150">Draws her Sword. </stage>
          </l>
          <l>And here, with Sword in Hand, declare </l>
          <l>To justifie it, against all that dare </l>
          <l>Strive to undo the Painter, and the Player. </l>
          <l>The Poet, he, alas! only depends </l>
          <l>On your Good Nature, to become his Friends. </l>
          <l>But now, perhaps, you may believe I fear </l>
          <l>To see this naked Weapon. But I swear </l>
          <l>I'd fight our Foes, did I not too well know </l>
          <l>'Twould spoil my Character of being a Beau. </l>
          <l>Therefore, since I'm good natur'd, be you kind; </l>
          <l>For, rat me, Gentlemen, 'twas well design'd. </l>
          <l>But, Pax upon 'em, 'tis all home-spun Cloth; </l>
          <l>All from an English Web, and English Growth. </l>
          <l>But if we'd let it make a costly Dance </l>
          <l>To Paris, and bring home some Scenes from France, </l>
          <l>I'm sure 'twou'd take: For you, Gadzooks, are civil; </l>
          <l>And wish them well, that wish you at the Devil. </l>
