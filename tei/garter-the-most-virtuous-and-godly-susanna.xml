        <head>¶ The Prologue. </head>
        <l>BOnum opus laudabila, which is as much to say, </l>
        <l>Good workes though playne are worthy prayse, and so haue bene alway. </l>
        <l>Then though with Bullus Tully style, our Authour doe not frame, </l>
        <l>This his fyrst worke which you shall heare, yet do accept the same, </l>
        <l>For why the Story being good, the matter also true, </l>
        <l>Doth but declare a matter olde, as it were done anew. </l>
        <l>And sheweth forth how prone God is, to helpe such as are iust, </l>
        <l>And in that God before all men, doe put assured trust, </l>
        <l>Of Susans lyfe the story is, what trouble she was in, </l>
        <l>How narrowly she scaped death because she would not sinne, </l>
        <l>How wonderously she was prouokte, how vertuously she fled, </l>
        <l>The strong assaultes of wicked men, that lecherous lustes had led, </l>
        <l>To rauish her, and to pollute, her chaste and wyfely view, </l>
        <l>This is the somme of all that shall be shewed vnto you, </l>
        <l>And though perchaunce some wanton worde, doe passe which may not séeme </l>
        <l>Or gestures light not méete for this, your wisedomes may it déeme, </l>
        <l>Accoumpt that nought delightes the hart of men on earth, </l>
        <l>So much as matters graue and sad, if they be mixt with myrth, </l>
        <l>Of both which here I trust you shall, as in a myrrour sée, </l>
        <l>And that in such a decent sort as hurtfull shall not be, </l>
        <l>And for because ensample good, is méete in these our dayes, </l>
        <l>This hath he done to shorten tyme, to God giue all the prayse. </l>
        <l>Thus crauing quyet sylence now, my spéeche I meane to spare, </l>
        <l>Beholde when Sathan enters place, his mynde he will declare. </l>
