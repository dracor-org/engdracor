        <head>TO Thomas Ravenscroft, Esq; Late High Sheriff of Flintshire. </head>
        <opener>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
        </opener>
        <p>THo the Stars are plac'd at so great a distance from us, yet we behold their Light; and those that shine most bright are most admir'd. So Merit and Virtue dart their Influence from afar: You seem one of the first Magnitude. Shrewsbury is the Orb in which you are fixt; yet tho your Person is circumscrib'd there, your Virtues are diffusive thro all Counties: There they enjoy your Person, and here we admire your Virtues. Fame represents you to us so qualify'd with all the Ornaments▪ of a Gentleman, that you seem a new addition of Honour to your Family, and rather give Credit to the Name, than receive a Lustre from it: And yet it is so Ancient, that when William the Conqueror came into England, one of his Nobles Marry'd a Ravenscroft: He Marry'd, 'tis said, (<hi>Ex perantiquissima Ravenscroftorum Familia</hi>) out of the most, or very ancient Family of the Ravenscroft's. From thence, Sir, you are descended. I boast the same; but wish I cou'd boast the same Virtues too, that make you Eminent, and a Glory to the Name, your prudent government of your self your Generosity, <pb xml:id="ep000804-003-a"/>your Bounty, your Affability, and above all, your Principles of Honour and Loyalty. Interest sways you not, nor gives a Byas to your Actions: They all aim at Virtue, and there you nobly win the Game. Distress makes you not slight your Friend nor swerve from being Just. </p>
        <p>But while I am speaking truth of you, I may seem to flatter my self, that bear your Name; therefore I will not proceed to enumerate your Praises, lest it should be thought I arrogate to my self. </p>
        <p>This humble piece, which I dedicate to you, is the most trivial of any that have past my hands: Yet it has stood the Test of the Stage, with great success: But now it launches into the world in Print, it wants the support of some eminent person to protect it. Therefore, Sir, I prefix your name, to be its Refuge and Defence. If your Cand our will pardon its faults and imperfections, the world will then by your example favourably receive and cherish it, if not for its own merits, at least for yours, which command all Tongues to praise you, and all, Hearts to Love you. With this, I dedicate and devote my self to your Friendship and Service, hoping that a future Intimacy and farther Acquaintance, may establish me in your favour, and give me better opportunities to show how much, and how entirely▪ I esteem a person of your Worth and Character. </p>
        <closer>
          <salute>SIR, </salute>
          <signed>Your Admirer, and Most Humble Servant, Edward Ravenscroft. </signed>

        <l>MOre blest than Day, be this auspicious Night! </l>
        <l>W'hen with Your Presence we indulge our Sight. </l>
        <l>Our solitary Stage no longer rieves: </l>
        <l>The Sight of Princes still from Fate reprieves. </l>
        <l>So, when the glorious Ev'ning-Star does rise, </l>
        <l>Her glitt'ring Train attends, and fills the circling Skies. </l>
        <l>Thus we at need on Heav'n and You depend: </l>
        <l>Our Wishes rise, and the kind Beams descend. </l>
        <l>Oh! that we here cou'd oft'ner thus be blest! </l>
        <l>But mighty Joys too seldom are possest. </l>
        <l>With gloomy Looks we did your Absence mourn, </l>
        <l>And only liv'd in hopes of your Return. </l>
        <l>In pity grant our Sports one kindly Ray! </l>
        <l>We by your Presence live, and by your Smiles the Play. </l>
        <l>This fears no Censure; for, while you're in View, </l>
        <l>What can Spectators see or like but You? </l>
        <l>Seem but to like, and their Applause we'll boast, </l>
        <l>For sure to see You pleas'd is what will please them most. </l>

        <head>Prologue spoken by Mr. Betterton. </head>
        <byline>Written by Mr Motteux. </byline>
        <l>To day expect no Pageant Decoration, </l>
        <l>This Lord May'rs Show began the Reformation: </l>
        <l>Yet is our Entertainment odd and new; </l>
        <l>We've in our Show the First of Cuckolds too: </l>
        <l>And what we call a Masque some will allow </l>
        <l>To be an Op'ra, as the World goes now. </l>
        <l>So is your poysoning Quack miscall'd a Doctor, </l>
        <l>And your worst Mimick calls himself an Actor. </l>
        <l>So your dull Scribbler (to our Cost we know it) </l>
        <l>Writes a damn'd Play, and is misnam'd a Poet. </l>
        <l>Once Song and Dance cou'd buoy up want of Thinking, </l>
        <l>But now those Bladders can't prevent its Sinking: </l>
        <l>Plays grow so heavy, that those helps are vain; </l>
        <l>Three times they sink, and never rise again. </l>
        <l>Well, if our Neighbours the Precedence claim, </l>
        <l>For good dull Stuff we'll not dispute with them. </l>
        <l>Our Medley is perhaps as much too light, </l>
        <l>But let it pass— We don't take Money yet by weight. </l>
        <l>By Sympathy, 't shou'd please the Beaux, I know, </l>
        <l>For in all things an Op'ra's like a Beau. </l>
        <l>Both Beau and Op'ra on the Stage are seen; </l>
        <l>Both odd in Dress, and shifting still the Scene; </l>
        <l>Each dances, sings, and moves like a Machine. </l>
        <l>To be admir'd, 'tis at a vast Expence; </l>
        <l>It loves soft words, but cares not much for sence; </l>
        <l>For by its Nature 'twas design'd ' for show; </l>
        <l>Why, 'tis an Op'ra but to dress a Beau. </l>
        <l>But one unlucky diff'rence stands between; </l>
        <l>Op'ra's are paid, but Beaux pay to be seen, </l>
        <l>(Those who don't come to sharp an Act I mean.) </l>
        <l>For your own sakes, we beg Applause of you; </l>
        <l>Since 'twill revenge, you on the Scribbling Crew. </l>
        <l>For, if this takes, strait crys each senceless Elf, </l>
        <l>Dem-me, I'd write as well as this my self. </l>
        <l>With that, he writes a things which we refuse, </l>
        <l>Then, wondring how we durst affront his Muse, </l>
        <l>Strait in a huff he gives it t' other House; </l>
        <l>Who either slight it, or 'twill be its Lot </l>
        <l>To get as much as their last Op'ra got, </l>

        <head>Epilogue spoken by Mr. Bowen. </head>
        <byline>Written by Mr Motteux. </byline>
        <l>GOod People! save the Body of our Play, </l>
        <l>From those who to dissect it Yonder stay, </l>
        <l>Like Surgeons on an Execution day. </l>
        <l>Ev'n e're it dyes they'll mawl it, I m afraid; </l>
        <l>And you'd thinkt hard, like me, in such a dread, </l>
        <l>To be dissected, e're you're hang'd, and dead. </l>
        <l>The fear of this our trembling Scribbler's kills; </l>
        <l>I dare say they've no need to take my Pills. </l>
        <l>Pray spare 'em: Learn of Vulcan to forgive; </l>
        <l>Or else, egad, few Plays or Wives will live. </l>
        <l>Ev'n he, methinks, too late his wrath did smother, </l>
        <l>Here, Wives and Husbands keep not such a pother, </l>
        <l>But fairly strive t' out-Cuckold one another. </l>
        <l>Why, shou'd all dye that follow th' Occupation, </l>
        <l>Oonds! 'twere the way to cut off half the Nation. </l>
        <l>Besides, Horns are not seen; shou'd they appear, </l>
        <l>Gadsooks, yon Place wou'd ev'n outhorn Horn-Fair. </l>
        <l>You'd see your Surly Dons toss their Bull's Feathers, </l>
        <l>And your tame poor Contented bleat like Weathers. </l>
        <l>Lewd rakish Husbands butt with Goatish Horns, </l>
        <l>And half-made Cuckolds with an Unicorn's. </l>
        <l>Now as all have to Cuckoldry a Call, </l>
        <l>So will the Curse of scribling on you fall; </l>
        <l>‛ E gad these Times make Poets of us all. </l>
        <l>Then do not damn your Brothers of the quill; </l>
        <l>To be reveng'd, there's hope you'll write as ill. </l>
        <l>For nere were seen more Scribes, yet less good writing, </l>
        <l>As there nere were more Soldiers, yet less Fighting. </l>
        <l>Both can do nothing if they want supplies. </l>
        <l>Then aid us; and our League its neighbouring Foes defies; </l>
        <l>Tho they brib d lately one of our Allies. </l>
        <l>Sure you'd not have us, for want of due pittance, </l>
        <l>Like Nicompoops sneak to them for admittance. </l>
        <l>No; propt by you our fears and dangers cease, </l>
        <l>Here firm, tho Wealth decay, and Foes increase, </l>
        <l>We'll bravely tug for Liberty and Peace. </l>

But to avoid all inconveniencies, and fatal accidents, that may happen to our Family, by such a disproportion'd Marriage, I must tell you plainly, you shan't have my consent; and I hope you will not take it ill of me. </p>

You must know, my Patient, Sir, has labour'd many months first under a Tertian, then under a Quartan, and now 'tis turn'd to a Quotidian: The Fever we have pretty well abated, yet after all,— besides a great disposition he has to sleep, which very much fatigues him,— that which he spits from him, is very white— now, Sir, in my judgment that's an ill symptom, for a <foreign xml:lang="lat">Pituita alba aqua inter cutem supervenit, </foreign>says Hipocrates and this you know well enough, the Greeks call Leucophelgmateia— so then according to Hipocrates, this white spitting, or <foreign xml:lang="lat">Pituita alha </foreign>is an evident sign, that the Hydropsie, or Dropsie will succeed. Now, Sir, what say you is the most soveraign Remedy to be given in this Case to hinder this evil consequence? </p>
